"“Folks who benefit from having fewer people participate are constantly looking for new ways to suppress turnout,” said Stuart Naifeh, an attorney at Demos who was involved in a high-profile voter purge case at the United States supreme court last year. Voter purges “is one that seems to have become more popular.”
Purging is not new – federal law has required it for more than two decades – but there is a new awareness of how purges can remove eligible voters from the rolls and target populations that move a lot: the young, the poor and people who live in cities, all groups that tend to favor Democrats.

"Today, Demos is launching a campaign for the month of December aimed at raising at least $100,000 to support our work in Winning the Next 20 Years—and we’re excited to announce that the first $25,000 raised will be matched by the Suzanne and David Johnson Foundation.
Support Our Work
Rarely in recent history has the difference between two possible American futures seemed so stark. We can continue down our current path, dismantling democratic institutions and concentrating power among a shrinking number of people—or we can build multi-racial coalitions that put the tools of democracy and economic opportunity in everyone’s hands.
Demos has been at the forefront of the fight for that second future: halting efforts to purge voters in Florida, Indiana, Ohio, and Texas; partnering with on-the-ground organizations to restore voting rights to people with felony records in Florida; and playing a key role in passing the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act in New York State, a model for equity-centered policy and advocacy that can be adopted by other states, and by the nation.
Today is a chance to stand as one against a future where only some voices are heard. In the crucial year ahead, we will continue to fight against voter suppression and disenfranchisement and to elevate the issues that will shape this country’s next 20 years—confronting the climate crisis, lifting the burden of student debt, and building the political power of communities of color to achieve a truly equitable society.
The inclusive future we envision is within our reach, and we’re putting in the work now, which is made possible by the backing of hundreds of supporters such as yourself.
Thank you for what you can give today.

"Happy New Year from all of us at Demos! Here are a few things we’re thinking about as 2020 begins:
— Stuart Naifeh, Demos Senior Counsel on the Wisconsin purge, quoted in The Guardian
 ",blog
"As we kick off 2020, civil rights lawyers are focused on protecting voting rights so that everyone can be heard in this pivotal presidential election year. One of the most hidden and racially disparate forms of voter disenfranchisement, however, is receiving too little attention: the denial of voting rights to pretrial jail detainees.
On any given day—including Election Day—over half a million people who are innocent until proven guilty sit in jail awaiting trial.
On any given day—including Election Day—over half a million people who are innocent until proven guilty sit in jail awaiting trial. Many of them are there because they are too poor to afford their bail. Although they are eligible and often registered to vote, citizens detained pretrial cannot get to the polls and often have no way of voting by absentee ballot. In the 1974 case O’Brien v. Skinner, the Supreme Court recognized that pretrial detainees have a fundamental right to vote and cannot be absolutely denied the franchise. And yet violation of their rights remains a systemic problem across the nation.
Demos is working to change this by filing litigation and advocating with election officials in several states.
My organization, Demos, is working to change this by filing litigation and advocating with election officials in several states. For example, we are currently suing Ohio in Mays v. LaRose, 2:18cv1376 (S.D. Ohio), over the state’s practice of denying absentee ballots and any other means of voting to eligible voters who are jailed in the days leading up to an election.
Eligible Ohio voters who find themselves jailed on pending charges or on a misdemeanor conviction may request an absentee ballot from their county board of elections. But such a request must be made in person at the board’s office by close of business on the Friday before an election or, if sent my mail, must be received at the board’s office by noon on the Saturday before an election. This means that no person arrested after close of business Friday and held in custody through Election Day will be able to request and vote by absentee ballot. Since county officials don’t make voting available on-site in jails and don’t escort people to the polls, these “late-jailed” voters have their voting rights absolutely denied.
As it happens, Ohio does allow people who are unexpectedly hospitalized (or whose minor children are unexpectedly hospitalized) in the days before an election to make an emergency absentee ballot request—all the way up to 3:00 p.m. on Election Day. The county will send two election officials to the hospital, ballot in hand, and these election officials will then deliver the completed ballot back to the board of elections. Alternatively, hospitalized voters can have a family member pick up the ballot and return it for them. This courtesy is not extended to late-jailed voters, even though the state plays a pivotal role in their inability to get to the polls. Unlike with hospitalized voters, it is the state that is keeping the accused from the polls.
In November 2018, our team at Demos, along with co-counsel at the Campaign Legal Center and the MacArthur Justice Center, sued in federal court. The Monday before the midterm elections, we sat in arraignments in multiple counties and observed which individuals were ordered detained. Collaborating with public defenders and other in-state advocates, and cross-referencing names from court dockets with the voter registration database, we then visited impacted individuals in jail. Two men detained in the Montgomery County Jail in Dayton, Quinton Nelson Sr. and Tommy Mays II, asked that we represent them and agreed to be class representatives in a class action suit.
Both were registered voters living in Dayton who had intended to vote on Election Day, November 6, 2018. Mr. Nelson was arrested at 10:00 p.m. on the Friday before Election Day, and Mr. Mays was arrested at 7:00 p.m. that Saturday. Both were detained on misdemeanor charges at the county jail on $10,000 bail and could not afford to buy their release. They completed handwritten affidavits in the jail’s visitation room on Monday evening.
As voting got underway the next morning, our team made its way from Dayton to the federal courthouse in Columbus. Having finished our pleadings during the drive, our team walked into federal court with a complaint and TRO motion alleging violations of the Equal Protection Clause and First Amendment. The judge held a hearing, granted the TRO, and ordered that ballots be delivered to our clients at the Dayton jail. Mr. Mays and Mr. Nelson both voted that day. And constitutional claims that otherwise would have faced serious ripeness and mootness problems were now properly before the court.
In the year that followed, we conducted extensive discovery and established a firm record that Ohio denies the opportunity to vote to citizens detained in the days leading up to an election. One election official also stated in deposition testimony that there are fifteen times as many hospitalized voters as jailed voters in the state, and the hospital voting process takes eleven times longer to complete than the jail voting process. When asked if there was “anything about the jails as opposed to the hospitals, that would make it such that there would be a reason the board would not be able to, on election day, after 3 p.m., receive the applications, determine the eligibility and print the ballot to deliver to the jail,” the election official answered, “Not to my knowledge.”
In November 2019, U.S. District Judge Michael Watson certified our class and granted summary judgment in our favor. Concluding that late-jailed and late-hospitalized voters are similarly situated in all relevant respects, he noted that the state had not proffered any justification for treating them differently “except the Ohio legislature’s potential determination that [the latter are] ‘particularly worthy’” (citing the state’s brief). Judge Watson continued: “But hospitalized persons are not more worthy of additional voting privileges under our Constitution than jail-confined persons, and offering greater access to the ballot simply because the legislature values the former’s votes over the latter’s is exactly what the Equal Protection clause forbids.”
The court enjoined Ohio from imposing different absentee ballot request deadlines on late-jailed voters and late-hospitalized voters. The state has appealed. Case No. 19-4112. Although the Sixth Circuit denied a stay, it ordered expedited briefing in January and February so that the case can be decided in advance of Ohio’s March 17, 2020 primary.
[R]oughly 1,000 eligible and registered Ohio voters found themselves behind bars and unable to cast a ballot in each of the last four federal general elections.
Voting rights for pretrial detainees is no trivial matter. Our expert witness in Mays estimated that roughly 1,000 eligible and registered Ohio voters found themselves behind bars and unable to cast a ballot in each of the last four federal general elections. And that’s just one state. Jail voting is such a pervasively neglected right that the aggregate consequences of noncompliance with the Constitution must be severe. Moreover, biases and disparities in criminal law enforcement mean that these violations hit communities of color and low-income voters hardest.
More litigation is needed. We are actively building cases and are eager to work with local counsel around the country. Where state and local officials are willing, litigation may be unnecessary and solutions are at hand. One model is the landmark legislation enacted in Illinois last year, SB 2090, which requires that Cook County Jail become a temporary polling place at election time and that all other counties make arrangement for absentee ballot voting. Grassroots groups like Chicago Votes were at the center of the legislative push and are working with government officials to make the reforms a success. Demos is committed to this work and welcomes the partnership of anyone interested in building a more inclusive democracy.

"Haiti is a beacon of revolution and resistance where it’s people are born with the unwillingness to accept anything less than freedom and equality.
Reflecting on the 216th anniversary of the Haitian Independence on January 1, I think about how a single story often defines Haiti and her inhabitants — that Haiti is an impoverished, disaster beaten country that struggles with deep rooted political instability. This single story misses the reality:  Haiti is a beacon of revolution and resistance where it’s people are born with the unwillingness to accept anything less than freedom and equality. From prolific military tactician and a founding father of Haiti, Toussaint L’Ouverture, to Haitian-American political campaign organizer under Obama from 2008-2012, Karine Jean-Pierre, Haitians have an inherent thirst for change and fighting spirit that grows with each new generation.  
I’m a first-generation Haitian American and I want deeply for the US to actively raise up the contributions and achievements of my ancestral home. With that said, the question remains — what can the U.S. and other global communities learn from Haiti? 
 
In the year following the catastrophic earthquake of 2010 that damaged Haiti’s agricultural backbone, Monsanto, a multi-billion dollar American argi-business company, gifted a $4 million donation of hybrid seeds to Haitian farmers, alleging to support reconstruction efforts. What seemed to be a gesture of good will was, in reality, an endeavor that would eventually disrupt Haiti’s  fragile agricultural economy and ultimately create dependency on Monsanto’s seeds. In the U.S., Monsanto is known for their wide range of chemical products like Miracle Gro and Roundup Weedkiller. However, studies prove that the company produces dangerous and harmful products, select Monsanto products cause cancer, and illegally spreads toxic pesticides over Maui, Hawaii. Grassroots organizations like Haiti’s Papaye Peasant Movement (MPP), the oldest and largest farmers organization in the country, responded by organizing a protest with over 10,000 farmers to protect the livelihoods of thousands of Haitian farmers and committed to destroying and burning the hybrid seeds if it reached them. The movement continues to take back the power of Haitian farmers and dismantling a narrative of dependency and helplessness.
 
Haitian folklore tells us about the creation of the country’s flag.
Haitian folklore tells us about the creation of the country’s flag. Jean-Jacques Dessalines, the first leader of a newly independent Haiti, created the flag with the help of his niece, Catherine Flon, to symbolize the union of black Haitians and free people of color to shake off caste systems of old colonial structures and structural colorism. Uprising against exploitive governments is nothing new to Haitians. Today, Haitians are embroiled in widespread pro-democracy protests dating back to when President Jovenel Moïse was seated in early 2017. Haitians stand united against rampant corruption to a level that has inspired the generally reticent Catholic Church to engage in demonstrations and stage peaceful protests calling for a change in the US-backed government. “The system is not for us. It’s for politicians to come in, get rich, and do all kinds of corrupt activities in accord with the private sector,” said Daphne Valmond-Bourgoin, a 40-year-old protester. Across the country, Haitians are calling for accountability of elected officials, transparency of public funds, and less foreign intervention similar to the American political environment. Haitian citizens have consistently criticized dictatorships and authoritarian leaders while making an effort to have more say in their government. Foreign intervention prevents progress to an inclusive democracy, but Haitians counter that by continuing to raise concerns at the world stage. 
Haitian people have the grit to fight powerful adversaries and the resiliency to deal with the repercussions of it. On this Haitian Independence Day, the world must recognize Haiti and her people not only for their struggle, but also for their ingenuity, their resolve and their courage. As one of the oldest republics in the region, Haiti is the cradle of revolution and resistance.",blog
"Since the ratification of the Constitution, the document has been amended several times to protect the voting rights of African Americans and women, and to extend the right to vote to those 18- to 20-years-old. Each of those amendments took decades of strife and protest to adopt and then implement. Yet even now, the language of the Constitution does not provide an affirmative, unassailable guarantee that all US citizens of legal voting age will be able to vote. Whatever affirmative guarantees we do have are usually in state constitutions or their subsequent amendments.
With a constitutional amendment, it wouldn’t be only the incarcerated who benefit. A constitutional amendment could supersede civically bankrupt voter ID laws. As a constitutional amendment, voting — both protecting it and encouraging it — becomes a congressional matter, and would be standardized across states. With such an amendment, allowing same-day voter registration and automatic voter registration won’t be pipe dreams but best next steps.

"In 2016, Donald Trump won the state of Wisconsin by fewer than 23,000 votes out of almost 3 million cast in the state. Now, as we enter 2020, a massive voter purge threatens to skew the electorate and prevent eligible voters from having their say.
In October, the conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty (WILL), a group that has backed former governor Scott Walker’s attacks on organized labor, filed a lawsuit against the Wisconsin Election Commission, asking the court to force the Commission to purge 234,000 voters from the state’s voter rolls. One week ago, a judge ruled in WILL’s favor and ordered the purge. According to our analysis, the voters targeted for removal are disproportionately voters of color. 
 
WILL’s lawsuit targets voters who were flagged as having moved through an interstate system known as ERIC. [...] But ERIC doesn’t always get it right.
WILL’s lawsuit targets voters who were flagged as having moved through an interstate system known as the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC). ERIC pools voter registration, postal service, and driver’s license information from member states and attempts to identify voters who have moved within the state or to another member state, allowing states to remove those who have become ineligible to vote in the election district in which they are registered. But ERIC doesn’t always get it right. In 2017, the first year Wisconsin participated in ERIC, 46,000 of the more than 340,000 individuals on Wisconsin’s ERIC list—double Trump’s margin of victory—were incorrectly flagged as having moved. These individuals were purged after failing to respond to a mailed notice that gave them 30 days to confirm or update their registrations. 
Recognizing the inaccuracies in the ERIC list and having experienced the consequences in the 2018 election cycle when the names of thousands of eligible, registered voters were missing from poll books when they went to vote, the Wisconsin Election Commission decided to take it more slowly the second time around. Voters on the 2019 ERIC list would be given until after the 2020 election to confirm or correct their registrations—which they could do by responding to a mailing or by confirming their address at the polls on election day. Protecting voters from improper removal would mean higher participation by eligible voters. WILL sued to prevent WEC from taking that voter-protective approach. The lawsuit charged that Wisconsin law requires voters on the ERIC list to be purged if they don’t respond to the mailing within 30 days. Last Friday, Ozaukee County Circuit Judge Paul Malloy agreed and ordered the Election Commission to begin cancelling registrations immediately. 
 
We can use demographic data from the U.S. Census Bureau to estimate the impact this purge could have based on race in Wisconsin.
The Wisconsin Election Commission has not publicly released the list that was used to target voters for removal, and this lack of detailed public data prevents us from knowing exactly which voters are affected by the court’s order. But we can use demographic data from the U.S. Census Bureau to estimate the impact this purge could have based on race in Wisconsin. These data indicate that a disproportionate number of mailers were sent to areas with large Black voting bases. 
While the Black voting population comprises only 5.7% of Wisconsin’s total electorate, the highest concentrations of 2019 ERIC mailers were sent to areas that are home to the largest Black voting population in Wisconsin. Over one-third—35%—of the mailers sent to voters on the 2019 ERIC list went to the two counties where the vast majority of Wisconsin’s Black voters reside, Milwaukee and Dane. These two counties are home to three quarters—74.665%—of Wisconsin’s Black voters; Black voters make up 17.45% of these counties’ entire electorate.1
And while these counties are large, they are not large enough to account for the significantly higher number of their voters targeted in WILL’s lawsuit. For example, Milwaukee County makes up 15% of Wisconsin’s electorate, but received almost 22% of the mailers. Similarly, Dane County makes up 9% of the electorate and received 13% of the total mailers. In comparison, Fond Du Lac County, which has an electorate that is 96% white, makes up 2% of Wisconsin’s total electorate and received 1.4% of mailers. 
Census data also indicate that this voter purge could negatively impact Latino and Asian American voters in Wisconsin. Milwaukee County is home to 37.32% of the state’s Latino voters, and 20.73% of its Asian voters.2 Many of these voters have a limited ability to understand English, but the ERIC mailers were not provided in any other language.
 
The court-ordered voter purge in Wisconsin will fall disproportionately on some of the most vulnerable voters. Although Wisconsin allows registration right up through Election Day, voters who want to register at the polls have to bring proof of address—something voters who believe they are registered don’t think to take with them when they go to vote. And when more voters have to register on Election Day, it increases the amount of time everyone has to wait in line to vote. 
Disproportionately excluding voters of color will weaken democracy in the state and could have profound effects for the nation.
Disproportionately excluding voters of color will weaken democracy in the state and could have profound effects for the nation. Voting rights advocates in the state have now asked a federal court to intervene and stop this unwarranted and discriminatory purge. Whatever the courts may do, Wisconsin voters must recognize the purge for what it is: undue voter suppression that will hit communities of color hardest.  ",blog

As the country barrels forward through possible impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump and with a highly fractious and high-stakes 2020 election careening towards us, there is no question that American democracy is at a moment of crisis. But the crisis of our democracy is about much more than the chaos emanating from the current occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, or the risk of a slide into autocracy. For too many Americans, democracy has been a value in name only, as our lived realities have been something very different. What does it mean to be a democracy where Black Americans—Like Atatiana Jefferson, in Dallas, Texas—can be murdered in their own homes by agents of the state? Or where an Amazon warehouse worker can be fired for falling behind on orders for even a few moments, their every movement surveilled and tracked, even as other workers can have a heart attack on the job and lie unassisted for over twenty minutes? Or where whole cities and communities can lie in debt and economic ruin as fodder for financial firm returns. The harsh reality is that there are elements of autocracy already here in America; it has just been unevenly distributed. 
And that means that the task of (re)building our democracy is not just about the 2020 elections—though they are absolutely critical to our aspirations for an inclusive and equitable future. The task ahead requires much more than mobilizing voters and winning a Presidential election. It requires building and shifting power—in particular, the power of Black and brown communities and working families, where “we the people” really does mean all of us. It also requires creating an entirely different infrastructure that can sustain and deepen this power, and make it tangible and real for people in their daily lives.  In our new book, Civic Power, we outline what this approach to building bottom-up democratic power could look like, and how it requires moving beyond conventional approaches to reform.
One of the central challenges to a power-oriented approach to democracy reform comes from the conventions of reformers themselves. Often, democracy reform is animated by one of four common presumptions about what ails democracy and how to fix it: 
Together these approaches to democracy reform comprise what we conventionally think of as a “good governance” ethos, a way of conceptualizing democracy’s failures and its remedies. While each of these approaches has some element of truth and value, there is a common limitation: they all to different degrees share a desire to purify policymaking of the vagaries of disagreement or conflict, in search of some apolitical and true form of democracy. Implicitly, these approaches all hold that deep down, the people are fundamentally in agreement around common-sense public policy, and if only there were greater information, data, and virtuous citizenship, free of the complications of interest group politics and partisanship, democracy would thrive. 
But these approaches risk erasing another key reality: that politics is about who governs and who has power, and that democracy fails not just because of some technical limitations of our institutional system but because there are real interests who benefit from democracy’s failure. Furthermore, these approaches also imply a strangely narrow conception of what role the people themselves should play in democratic governance, imagining a sterilized and distant democratic public rather than a democracy that actively engages and empowers those most directly impacted. 
These conceptual limitations of good governance reform have real political consequences, narrowing the scope of reform vision to more technical, technocratic reforms that while they may succeed in making government more “efficient”, do little to actually shift the balance of power in our society. There is also a sociological root to this: too often, democracy reform conversations can take place in more elite circles among policymakers, reformers, or institutions with more privileged backgrounds, rather than centering the voices of those most marginalized and affected, in ways that compounds the erasure of racial, gender, class, and power disparities. 
By contrast, a power-oriented approach to democracy reform focuses not just on technical institutional design questions but on a broader look at how organizing, institutions, and democratic infrastructure can be remade to re-allocate decision-making power. Specifically, building power requires a multipronged approach: first, organizing people into empowered communities capable of exercising political voice and influence; and second, institutionalizing the power of grassroots communities to shape day-to-day policymaking and governance.
From the Movement for Black Lives to the Women’s March, the Red for Ed protests, the March for our Lives, and much more, we are in a moment of renewed grassroots mobilization and protest. These movements have radically changed the windows of political possibility, activating new voters and grassroots leaders, and shifting the outcomes of electoral and policy debates. It is a powerful reminder that building an inclusive democracy requires catalyzing, sustaining, and deepening the capacity of communities to exercise political influence. 
While we often refer to a vague democratic “public opinion” to see what voters and communities want, the reality is that politics and public policy are shaped less by the inchoate and often inconsistent preferences of the public, and more by the balance of power among organized interest groups. Indeed, we can trace much of our current crisis of economic inequality and persisting racial inequity to the efforts of business groups to organize strategically over the last forty years through lobbying, campaign contributions, and more subtle techniques of regulatory and legal advocacy and capture to drive a business-friendly deregulatory agenda and help rollback advances of the civil rights movement. Public policy is consistently and demonstrably more responsive to the whims and desires of wealthier, and better organized Americans. Conservative policies like “right-to-work” laws and the loosening of antitrust and financial regulations are not just about economic policy; rather these are deliberate strategies to shift power by breaking the political efficacy of organized labor and unshackling the economic and political influence of big business.  
It follows then that building an inclusive democracy requires a counter shift in political power towards the people themselves, both by constraining and breaking the concentrated power of the wealthy and of corporate interests and by deepening the organization and strategic capacity of grassroots communities. This, in turn, means taking a radically different approach to civic engagement. 
Too often, civic engagement initiatives and funding streams focus on narrow goals of mobilization: registering and turning out voters, exhorting communities to be virtuous citizens by engaging in politics, and the like. And even more tragically, when we experience mass waves of mobilization—such as the 2008 Obama election—these surges of grassroots energy and activation have been kneecapped, converted into email fundraising machines rather than into genuine, grassroots organized capacity. A power-oriented approach to organizing instead focuses on investing directly in organizations and movements.
First, investing in grassroots groups and leaders empowers them to grow power and capacity within their own communities, centering those most directly affected. This means moving away from flash-in-the-pan moments of mobilization and last-minute efforts at voter turnout, and instead turning to year-round organizing to build collective power that can contest elections and exercise pressure on government in a more impactful and sustained way.
Second, deep relational organizing builds new leaders who emerge from their own communities over the course of movement-building and advocacy campaigns. These leaders are powerful voices for change, rooted in their communities, and have an exponential effect on expanding the imagination, vision, and impact of grassroots power. 
Third, power-building organizing requires taking a sophisticated, strategic approach to advocacy campaigns, targeting not just visible forms of injustice, but also building the narratives, the public political education, and the capacity to tackle the hidden, structural drivers of exclusion and extraction. For example, new worker movements are focused not just on issues of wages but also on how the behind-the-scenes power of investors are driving the increasing precarity of work.
Fourth, this kind of deep organizing can create a new sense of shared fate and mutual solidarity while centering the most frontline communities, especially empowering black and brown communities and working families. By making visible the structural roots of on-the-ground inequities, and by creating a space and vehicle for collective action to address these problems, organizing can forge new bonds within and across constituencies bound together by a shared fate. Consider for example how new investments in climate resiliency succeeded in part because of organizing efforts that advanced an affordability and climate agenda in both the cities and suburbs, centering communities of color across the state. 
Just as building power requires a deeper approach to civic engagement, it also requires shifting our conventional approaches to governing, policymaking, and institutional design. To shift power, we need to invest not just in organizing capacity but also in governance capacity, remaking our policymaking institutions to more directly center, empower, and engage frontline communities. If democracy is rule by “we the people,” then the actual day to day business of democratic policymaking must be more driven by the most affected constituencies. This in turn means taking a radically different approach to how we structure and operate administrative agencies and the policymaking bureaucracy. 
Bureaucracies are in many ways at the heart of everything that is flawed about conventional democracy. Democracy reform tends to give elections, voting, and the federal legislature pride of place. And no doubt these institutions are critical for democracy to exist. But democracy and equitable power require more than well-functioning elections and legislatures. Administrative agencies—like the Environmental Protection Agency or municipal zoning boards or state labor commissions—are the actual frontline institutions of governance, where many of the most consequential decisions and policies are decided and actually implemented. 
The centrality of governance institutions is not just procedural; these institutions are key in addressing substantive questions of inequality and exclusion. Without powerful civil rights enforcement agencies and offices, racial and gender discrimination and exclusion cannot be undone. Without an administrative regime to protect workers, or to provide universal access to public goods and the safety net, inequality increases. Given the importance of governance institutions in addressing the substantive, chronic, and structural dimensions of inequality and exclusion, it should be unsurprising that the dismantling of these institutions has been central to the political and policy strategy of the kinds of business interests and exclusionary politics
Yet these institutions are often overlooked in discussions of democracy reform. Too often, bureaucracies are left to either be vilified and dismantled by the Right, or further insulated from democracy under an apolitical, technocratic commitment by liberals to “good governance.” Instead, we need to reimagine an approach to bureaucracy that centers power and democracy, leveraging bureaucratic institutions as a way to further institutionalize direct decision-making authority for frontline communities. Bureaucracies themselves can be created, reformed and re-staffed to orient towards the need to redress disparities of democratic participation and power, and to bake this orientation more deeply into the day to day work of governing. To put it another way, we need to approach governance not just in terms of securing the policy wins for our campaigns and our communities, but rather in terms of remaking governing institutions themselves in ways that deepen our long-term power.
First, institutionalizing power requires embedding more points of leverage and influence that grassroots communities can use in the policymaking process itself. These “hooks and levers” can take different forms. For example, at different points in the past, social movements have briefly experimented with legislative and regulatory innovations that mandated stakeholder representation and participation: from the War on Poverty’s attempt at requiring “maximum feasible participation” of grassroots communities to the now-neutered Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s efforts to engage frontline communities more directly in agenda-setting and policy design. At the local level, experiments in participatory budgeting and community power in shaping and monitoring urban development projects offer roadmaps for institutionalized forms of participation that embed more durable and effective forms of grassroots power.  
Second, we need to remake the internal structure, personnel, and even culture of government itself to center these democratizing initiatives. Governing through more inclusive and participatory models that directly empower frontline communities requires significant investment and expertise on the part of conveners who design representative and participatory mechanisms, provide briefings for the participants on relevant data and issues, and facilitate discussion to lead to concrete, usable recommendations. Policymakers tend not to invest in these skills or tasks. To fully harness the potential of institutional design and policymaking for building countervailing power, this will have to change. If we are serious about democratizing governance, we will need to invest in people’s leadership development, both in current employees and in building a diverse talent pipeline—including imagining a world where grassroots leaders and organizers themselves are viewed as experts in their own right and positioned in high-level cabinet and regulatory positions themselves. It will also require moving governing bodies away from an obsession with efficiency, privatization, and technocratic decision-making to instead emphasize participation and equity.
True democracy reform must be transformative and bold enough to meet the challenges of the moment. Democracy is not going to be achieved by tinkering around the edges of existing economic, social, and political regimes. Neither optimizing government to make it more efficient, nor generating mass numbers of online petition signers will suffice. Democracy is a radical, transformative aspiration, committed to building the deep and durable power of grassroots communities to author their own destinies through the shared exercise of the powers and responsibilities of governance. 
But radical democracy is not utopian; it is rather very real and achievable. That realness is often mundane: radical democracy can be found in the painstaking door-by-door work of organizing new movements, coalitions, and communities, of forging common identities, and of building the relationships and organizational muscles needed to assert political power. Radical democracy can be found in the work of policy design, optimized not for efficiency, but for inclusion. Radical democracy can be found in the work of bureaucratic culture-shifting, transforming staid government organizations into open and inclusive forums and counterparts, where communities can engage and participate in the business of decision making. 
Indeed, these are broad aspirations; they will require significant organizing and advocacy work on the part of civil society actors as well as radical institutional and policy change on the part of governments. But this is not the first time America has faced a crossroads where the survival of democracy is at stake. Reconstruction after the Civil War, the Populist and Progressive movements culminating in the New Deal response to the upheavals of industrial capitalism, and the Civil Rights movement (and its successive inclusionary movements) of the 1960s and 1970s all represent major transformative moments when American democracy created new institutions that expanded its responsiveness and staved off the pathologies of corruption, systemic exclusion, and deliberate de-democratization. Whether today’s movements, organizations, and institutions will similarly be able to restore and even deepen American democracy in the twenty-first century remains to be seen.",blog

Ohio has purged more voters from its rolls than any other state — 2 million voters from 2011 to 2016, including 1.2 million for infrequent voting. An analysis from Reuters found that voters in Democratic-leaning areas were nearly twice as likely to be removed as those in Republican-leaning ones.

"Kathy Culliton-Gonzalez, a lawyer who works on automatic voter registration at Demos, a progressive think tank, said some of the momentum toward automatic voter registration was born out of the controversy surrounding the results of the 2000 election, long lines to vote across the country in the 2012 election and efforts to pass voter ID laws to make it more difficult to vote.

"""One thing driving Labour’s over performance was youth turnouts,"" Sean McElwee, a policy analyst who studies voter attitudes and behavior at the progressive think tank Demos, said in an interview.
McElwee thinks that Labour’s success could be a model for progressives in the United States provided they learn some key lessons about how to enlist and galvanize voters.
""[In 2016] Clinton had a fine policy platform, but the difference is the messaging,"" McElwee said. ""The future of Democrats is an aggressive, progressive policy platform combined with populist messaging.""
But McElwee points out that just capturing the youth’s imagination isn’t enough — you have to get them registered to vote. An essential key to Labour’s victory was that voter registration increased by 20% over the 2015 elections, delivering an enormous student vote for the Labour Party.
""When you reduce the barrier to registration, you’re going to increase turnout,"" he said. If every registered voter under 30 in the U.S. voted, their turnout would still be lower than that for voters over 65. We solve that with pre-registration.

Our findings suggest that AVR is effective in raising voter turnout, especially among individuals who are voting for the first time or are less frequent voters.

"The Massachusetts lawsuit alleges that the Commonwealth failed to provide required voter registration services at public assistance offices, a violation of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA). 
In 1993, Congress passed the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA)—commonly known as the “motor voter” law—to boost election participation by ensuring that all eligible citizens have ample opportunities to register to vote. 
Because Congress determined that low-income citizens and those with disabilities are less likely visit motor vehicle departments (the law’s primary voter registration site), it included Section 7’s requirements for state agencies that provide public assistance, including those that administer federal assistance programs such as food stamps, Medicaid, TANF, and WIC, and disability offices, to assist their applicants and clients in registering to vote.
Many states across the country, like Massachusetts, have been neglecting their responsibilities to provide voter registration at public assistance offices.  Starting in 2006, organizations including Demos, Project Vote and the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law have filed lawsuits to rectify these violations in Ohio, Missouri, Georgia, Louisiana, New Mexico, Indiana, Pennsylvania and Nevada.  Pre-litigation notice letters have been sent to many other states including Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas, Michigan, Florida, Texas and Virginia.  Some states have worked with our organizations cooperatively to resolve compliance issues without the need for a federal lawsuit, including Mississippi, North Carolina, Colorado Michigan and Virginia.  
The aim of all these efforts is simply to ensure that the voting rights of low-income persons are protected and that states comply with their federal-law obligations to provide voter registration services as intended by Congress when it enacted the NVRA.
 
Bethzaida Delgado, NAACP New England Area Conference (NAACP-NEAC), and New England United for Justice (NEU4J) have a lawsuit pending against the Massachusetts Department of Transitional Assistance (DTA) and Secretary of the Commonwealth (SOC).  The suit was filed in May 2012, following investigations that began in early 2011 and a pre-litigation notice letter sent to the SOC in December 2011.
The NAACP, the oldest, largest and most effective civil rights advocacy organization in the country, and NEU4J, a community organization, help low-income Massachusetts citizens register to vote. Ms. Delgado is a DTA client who is eligible to vote but was not offered the opportunity to register in her interactions with DTA offices over several years.
The plaintiffs are represented by voting rights groups Demos, Project Vote, the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, and the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice, as well as the law firm of Ropes & Gray LLP. 
Defendants named in the suit are Massachusetts Secretary of State William F. Galvin and officials from the Executive Office of Health and Human Services and DTA.
 
The Massachusetts lawsuit alleges that the Commonwealth failed to provide required voter registration services at public assistance offices, a violation of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA). 
According to 2010 Census Bureau data, only 58.2% of the Commonwealth’s eligible low-income citizens were registered to vote, as compared to 76.9% of higher-income citizens – a voter registration gap of 18.7%.  Despite this gap, the number of voter registration applications reported by Massachusetts public assistance offices has plummeted over the past 10 years – with only 2,007 applications reported in 2009-2010, compared to 26,984 in 1999-2000 – a reduction of over 95%. 
The NVRA requires public assistance offices to proactively offer clients the opportunity to register with every application for benefits, recertification of benefits, and change-of-address transaction. Interviews of Massachusetts’s public assistance clients conducted in the summer of 2011 showed that, of the 174 public assistance clients interviewed, 129, or 73%, reported that they received no offer of voter registration in any manner.
The goal of the suit is obtain concrete changes in DTA practices and procedures that will make voter registration available to every eligible public assistance agency applicant and client in the Commonwealth, as required by federal law.
 
After the lawsuit was filed, the Court scheduled a preliminary injunction hearing for August 17, 2012, and established an expedited discovery schedule, to allow quick pre-election relief for the tens of thousands of persons who had been denied the opportunity to register to vote prior to the election.  Once the Court ordered a quick hearing schedule, the parties entered into negotiations to see if they could agree on steps the state would take to avoid the expense of litigation.  After extensive negotiations with the Commonwealth, the parties reached an interim (short-term) agreement, which was signed on July 5, 2012.  It is not a final settlement, but only outlines immediate steps to be taken by the Commonwealth. 
Under the terms of the interim agreement, DTA and SOC have agreed to take steps to ensure that DTA clients have opportunities to register to vote prior to the upcoming presidential election.
The Commonwealth agreed to do the following in the next four months:
These changes are required to ensure that DTA employees are now offering, and in the future will offer, their clients the opportunity to vote as required by Section 7.
It is vital that states fulfill their legal obligations under Section 7 of the NVRA, and this interim agreement is a vital first step toward Massachusetts complying with federal law.
 
On July 17, 2012, the Court stayed all proceedings until December 31, 2012 to allow the parties to continue to negotiate a long-term agreement.  The case has not been dismissed and litigation will resume if there is no final settlement agreement by December 31, 2012.",policy-briefs
"Oregon was the first state to implement Automatic Voter Registration. It was a resounding success for Oregonians.
In January 2016, Oregon became the first state in the country to implement Automatic Voter Registration (AVR).1 AVR increases access to voting by using information already provided to governments in order to add eligible individuals onto the voter rolls. In contrast to current models of self- registration, AVR removes outdated, unnecessary and cumbersome barriers to voting, shifting the burden of voter registration away from individuals and onto government in the process.2 Under the Oregon AVR program, eligible but unregistered voters found through the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) databases are notified by mail that they will be added to the voter rolls, unless they decline registration within 21 days by returning a postcard to the state’s election authorities. For purposes of primary voting, this notification postcard also allows individuals to choose a political party. If no response is given, these individuals become automatically registered as “nonaffiliated” voters, which makes them ineligible to vote in primaries (Oregon has a closed primary system). Automatic address updates and notifications also take place through this system. 
• A Significant Share of Individuals Registered Through AVR Voted:
In 2016, 44 percent of those who were automatically registered voted in the November 8th election.3 Of the individuals who were registered for the first time through Oregon’s AVR law, 36 percent voted in 2016. Notably, automatically registered individuals account for 66 percent of individuals who registered in 2016 and voted. Ninety-five percent of those who were registered with AVR and voted in the 2016 election were first-time voters.4
• AVR Increased the Racial and Age Diversity of Oregon’s Voters:
Only 6 percent of the non-AVR voters were people of color, compared with 11 percent of first-time AVR voters and 15 percent of all individuals registered through AVR. While 3 percent of the non- AVR voters were Latino, 7 percent of new AVR voters and 9 percent of those registered with AVR were Latino. Thirty-seven percent of automatically registered persons who voted for the first time in 2016 were between the ages of 18-29, compared to 13 percent of the non- AVR voters. Forty-one percent of individuals registered with AVR were between the ages of 18-29. (See Figures 1 and 2.) 


• AVR Increased the Income Diversity of Oregon’s Voters: In a state with a median income of $51,000, 39 percent of new AVR voters lived in census blocks with a median income below $45,000, compared to 34 percent of the non-AVR electorate. Twenty-six percent of new AVR voters lived in neighborhoods with a median income over $60,000, compared with 31 percent of non-AVR voters. (See Figure 3.) 

The state of Oregon maintains a list of the individuals who were automatically registered to vote in 2016. We merged these individuals with Catalist, a subscription database with demographic and validated registration and voting history data on more than 260 million American adults. By merging individuals from the Oregon database with Catalist using their voter ID number11, we were able to obtain demographic and voting history data for a very large proportion of individuals who were automatically registered (98 percent of the data merged successfully between the Catalist and Oregon voter file data).12 Some demographic information, such as age, is available on the voter file. Oregon does not include race or ethnicity in its voter files, however. In such cases, Catalist uses a combination of information based on names and local racial/ethnic context to predict an individual’s race or ethnicity. Although the models are not perfect and should be treated with appropriate caution, they have been shown to be quite accurate in large-scale validation using public voter files.13 
Using the information available, we were able to compare the demographic profiles and voting histories of individuals who were registered through AVR (either for the first time, or because a previous registration had lapsed) to those of Oregon residents with up-to-date registrations prior to implementation of the AVR law. Furthermore, because Catalist stores registration and voting history data from previous election cycles, we could compare registrants under AVR with those who registered to vote in 2012.
Our source of data for the Voting Eligible Population (VEP), which accounts for non-citizens and other people not eligible to vote, comes from Michael McDonald’s United States Election Project. We also use Citizen Voting Age Population (CVAP), which accounts for non-citizens, based on estimates compiled by Bernard Fraga. These data sources are all similar, but have modestly different estimates of turnout and registration rates in the 2016 election. We use VEP when possible because it provides a more accurate picture of the potential electorate, and CVAP when necessary to examine demographic information.
In total, there were 97,184 individuals registered through automatic voter registration who voted in 2016; that year, automatically registered individuals accounted for 5 percent of the electorate.14 It’s possible that some of these individuals would have voted anyway. The analysis therefore was limited to 88,573 individuals who were registered with AVR and were first-time voters (meaning they don’t have a record of registration going back to 2008) in 2016.15 These AVR individuals make up 63 percent of those who were first-time registrants and voters in 2016, and 4 percent of the total 2016 electorate.",policy-briefs
"As with any big reform, the push for debt-free college has been met with pushback among a skeptical elite. We have answers for their major concerns.
It is undisputed that the way we pay for higher education has shifted drastically over the past few decades—from summer jobs and moderate savings, to increasingly greater amounts of debt. For all the talk of rising prices and the ubiquity of loans, it is easy to forget that we have arrived at this period not due to any big national debate over how to pay for college or whether a debt-based model is a good thing, but instead due to a long and silent shift toward austerity. This shift has its roots in relatively small decisions by state legislatures and governors to cut per-student funding for public colleges and universities a few percent per-year, as well as neglect from the federal government, which could have provided greater grant aid and asked states and institutions to meet the rising demand for higher education with greater investment. As a result, we are hurtling toward a system in which the affordable public college options of yesteryear no longer exist, with student debt simply replacing what was once paid for mainly by society.
That this happened without a great deal of public debate—at least at the national level—is instructive, and even as recently as 2008 and 2012, college affordability and student debt were not issues that loomed large in the national policy conversation. To the extent that rising college prices and debt were discussed, it was often as anecdotes in stump speeches about the larger economic distress facing American families. To the extent that policy reforms were offered, Democrats primarily wanted to provide more consumer information, make financial aid and student loan repayment easier and less painful, and expand tax benefits for students1, while Republicans attempted to bring back private banks and lenders as middlemen in the federal student loan program.2
Now, however, student loan debt and the cost of higher education have become top-tier policy issues in the 2016 campaign. Starting with President Obama’s embrace of state-based free community college programs, to Senator Bernie Sanders’ embrace of tuition-free public college, to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s support of debt-free public college, the national conversation has shifted from debates over interest rates and repayment plans to a push for fundamental reform of how we finance higher education, and whether we should make a new investment on par with the GI Bill and the Great Society.
Secretary Clinton in particular has made this issue a centerpiece of her economic and social policy platform. Her plan, which would create a new federal-state partnership to reignite state investment, in return for a pathway that does not include debt, and eliminates tuition for all but the wealthiest families, is a response to forces at work over a three-decade period. Its guiding principle—returning to debt-free public college—is built on a recognition that low-income students and students of color take on greater debt for the same degree as their whiter, wealthier counterparts, face greater risk than ever before when making college decisions, and are far more likely to struggle to repay student loans.3 While wealthy families still have a debt-free pathway, the complicated high-price system facing the working class is enough to prevent some from going to college altogether or dropping out, further putting distance between the haves and have-nots.
As with any big reform, the push for debt-free college and the new investments proposed have been met with pushback among a skeptical elite. Some are cynical that big reform is needed, and that a few small tweaks to the student loan program would solve the crisis among borrowers who are defaulting on student loans in record numbers.4 Others find the focus on affordability misguided, or that dire warnings about record prices being paid by families and record debt loads taken on by students will be counterproductive and suppress college attendance. And some question whether such a policy could really work in practice.
These concerns deserve a full hearing, but many are flawed in some way, while others misunderstand the structure of or intent behind debt-free college. This policy window to make big public investments in higher education represents an important moment and deserves a full-throated debate, one in which the public and elite thought leaders that drive public opinion are on the same page about what is being proposed, and the impact that it could have. With that in mind, these are the six most common concerns about or arguments against debt-free college, and why they should not get in the way of a once-in-a-generation investment.
 
In progressive circles, one pushback against debt-free college is that it would effectively subsidize wealthy families, since college-goers tend to come from the ranks of the middle-class and above, while those that do not go tend to have lower-incomes.5 This line of thinking animated much of the 2016 Democratic primary campaign, with some suggesting a flat, universal benefit of free public tuition would be a giveaway to rich families who do not need it.
It is important to make sure we do not create policy that subsidizes those that have reaped the limited gains of economic growth at the expense of those who have seen flat-lining wages and increased economic insecurity. Fortunately, this is precisely the point behind debt-free college. Unlike a flat benefit, it provides a simple guarantee to all families that students can attend public college through a part-time job and a modest family contribution from those with the ability to save. Wealthy families already have access to debt-free higher education—nearly half of those graduating from public college with no debt are from families making $100,000 or above.6 Our system of financial aid and public benefits have withered away and become insufficient to level the playing field between working class and wealthy students, resulting in greater unmet financial need, more debt, and greater risk.
In short, the intent of the policy is to eliminate unmet financial need, which takes up far more of a low-income family’s budget than a high-income family’s budget.7 A rich family faces zero unmet need and thus may not receive much of a subsidy—but will still be guaranteed debt-free college. Meanwhile, this frame allows for the federal government, states, and institutions, to spend money on students who must borrow the most and face the largest gaps in their financial aid packages.
And since students take on debt for more than just tuition, it ensures that the full cost of attendance is taken into account when assessing a student’s financial burden and ability to pay. Whether this means eliminating tuition for low- and middle-income families and allowing grant aid to cover living expenses, or another mechanism, it can certainly be designed (and, importantly, funded) in a progressive manner.
Further, the intent of debt-free college is to ensure that the college-going population no longer skews wealthy. There is nationally representative data indicating qualified and talented students who are concerned about rising college prices are 12 to 16 times more likely to forgo college altogether.8 For the majority (66%) of high school graduates and the half of low-income graduates that go onto some form of college,9 this new guarantee could mean the difference between attempting college and finishing college.
 
Perhaps the most common concern about debt-free college comes from higher education policy experts and institutional leaders, who bemoan the focus on student debt or high net prices at the expense of focusing on increasing college attainment. Some also worry that rhetoric about a crisis in student debt may convince students that college is not worth it or not valuable and that current debt levels are reasonable and sustainable for most students.10
It is absolutely true that degree-holders have better employment prospects and higher average wages, while many of those most likely to struggle with debt are those who have borrowed but dropped out of school.11 The average balance for loans that default is far lower than the average for college graduates, meaning that (somewhat paradoxically) those with higher debts are often in better shape than those with low balances.12 In other words, a college degree still holds substantial value for those who can get to the finish line. Thus, some argue, we should increase college completion rates and much of the problem of high net prices, as well as student loan delinquency and default, will likely disappear.13
The problem is that increasing completion almost certainly requires dealing with high prices and the prospect of debt. First, debt aversion or the shock of high prices prevents many students from attending college in the manner that would maximize completion. There is evidence that students who grew up poor are more averse to taking on loans, 14 while many students delay enrollment, enroll part-time, work too many hours, decreasing their likelihood of receiving a degree. Second, financial troubles are the top reason cited by students for dropping out of college, meaning that many would stay in school if we ensured that their financial needs were addressed for the entirety of their time in school. Third, loan debt may be impacting the ability of black students to complete in particular. According to one survey, 69% of African Americans who enrolled in college but did not finish said that they left college because of high student loan debt, while 43% of white students cited the same reason.15 White students who do not attend or complete are more likely to cite “lack of interest” rather than expenses, family responsibilities, or work as reasons.16 And Black students are far more likely than white students to drop out with debt, leaving us with a system that calcifies inequality rather than alleviating it.17
The idea of debt-free college is not a distraction from our need to increase college attainment rates. Rather, it is a strategy for increasing college attainment rates. To the extent that high unmet need, and the prospect or reality of debt, are stifling many students’ ability to go to college and graduate, debt-free college offers a pathway to go to college full-time without worry of financial barriers or unmet need getting in the way. 
Well over 90 percent of families think college is important or necessary, and the belief in education as a valuable pathway is true across race and generation.18 Many worry that negative rhetoric around student debt will scare students away from going to college. But the fact is that most families know it is important, many are willing to take on massive risk to achieve it, and others are simply unable to attend or complete due to rising prices and the debt that comes with it. A system predicated on taking out loans may be both inefficient and inequitable, regardless of whether most borrowers can make their monthly payment.
Further, the argument about the need to increase completion is myopic. For all the rhetoric about a “completion crisis,” our institutions of higher learning are graduating students at virtually the same rate they always have, and in fact completion rates have improved slightly over the past several years.19 The difference between a generation ago and today is that dropping out is fundamentally riskier, precisely due to the financial burden placed on students. Previously, a student dropping out may not have received the income boost of a degree, but her risk amounted to the opportunity cost of not working full-time while in college. Now, she faces a loan burden that for too many leads to delinquency, default, and ruined credit.
And to be sure, more borrowers are defaulting on their student loans. Student loan defaults have hit a record high, and serious delinquencies have risen and remained stubbornly high—and in fact, they remain higher than any other type of household debt—even as the economy has recovered.20 Enrollment in programs to help borrowers meet their payments, like the myriad income-driven repayment plans offered by the Department of Education, has risen slightly but done little to stem the rising tide of defaults.21
In short, as a college degree has become extremely valuable and a mostly necessary insurance policy, we have increased the risk of not attaining one. The reason for its value, though, is not because earnings prospects for college graduates have skyrocketed; in fact, they have remained relatively stagnant.22 Like most American families, wage stagnation is the reality for bachelor’s degree holders. The only saving grace is that the earnings for those with high school degrees or less have fallen precipitously. In other words, there is a high cost for not going to college, but the cost of college is going up far faster than graduate earnings. This has led to student borrowers extending repayment terms well beyond 10 years, with average repayment stretching 12-14 years.23 Graduates may be defaulting at lower rates relative to non-graduates, but they are contending with debt far longer than before.
 
Still more of the discourse around debt-free college, and new federal investments in higher education, is stifled by the age-old maxim that there is no such thing as a free lunch. To be clear, much of our spending on social mobility is subjected to this phrase, while tax cuts, expenditures through the tax code targeted at wealthy households, or subsidies toward national defense are not. In fact, the cost estimates of a new federal-state partnership for debt-free college equal less than one percent of the Obama Administration’s 2016 budget request, and less than percent of the national defense budget.24
And even the view that looks at higher education funding as expenditure alone is flawed. So too is the view that looks only at higher education’s benefits for individuals and assumes that they should pay high prices to achieve those benefits. Simply, students are the not the only ones to see gains from college. Education is a public good, an investment that reaps long-term gains in productivity, civic participation, health, tax revenue, and more. State investment in higher education reaps returns that more than make up for the initial expenditure.25 The OECD estimates that the total net public gain of supporting public higher education ranges between $75,000 and $200,000 per student in the United States.26 And previous large-scale federal investments to make college free, or debt-free, like the GI Bill, provided major gains and helped build a middle class that subsequently contributed to the economy and the tax system.27
To illustrate this, a counterfactual may be useful: Every level of education confers private benefits on its recipients. Those who graduate high school, for example, see better average earnings and employment prospects than those who do not. But unlike the rhetoric around college, we do not examine the individual benefits to a high school degree and ask families to go into debt to pay for it on the assumption that it is “worth it” for them to graduate. We understand the national interest in everybody chipping in to allow every student to graduate high school, free of charge. The massive rise in high school graduation rates over the second half of the 20th century would have certainly been stymied had we subjected all American high school students to student debt in kindergarten or 9th grade.
We have long had similar bipartisan rhetoric around higher education, from Richard Nixon declaring that “No qualified student who wants to go to college should be barred by lack of money. That has long been a great American goal; I propose that we achieve it now”28 to his predecessor, Lyndon Johnson, laying down a marker that any student can “apply to any college or any university in any of the 50 States and not be turned away because his family is poor.”29 But rhetoric has not been matched by the public investment that it would require to achieve that goal—and in its stead has been a system of rising prices, rising unmet need for low-income families, and higher risk taken on by those who borrow but do not graduate. Those who question whether we can afford new investments should be asked to explain why these principles are incorrect.
 
Three out of every four American college students attends a public college or university. At these colleges, tuition has increased at a higher rate than private non-profit institutions,30 driven namely by a pullback of state government support. The relationship between state disinvestment and the rise in tuition is highly correlated, and any new programs to achieve college affordability will require new federal investments—ideally via a renewed federal-state compact and an increase in student grant aid. As such, a three-decade-old argument known as the Bennett Hypothesis has been a sticking point for many opponents of debt-free college, who contend that federal spending on higher education only allows colleges to increase prices and extract the federal aid money for themselves.31
The Bennett Hypothesis has always been convenient for those who oppose greater public funding of higher education—after all, it sounds almost too good to be true that decreasing public funding would result in lower tuition. Unfortunately, it is too good to be true. As many have argued exhaustively, tuition has risen at public colleges steadily even when federal aid has remained stagnant.32 Federal loan limits for undergraduates have rarely changed, and the maximum Pell Grant has only inched up slightly, for decades while tuition has far outpaced any increase in available federal aid.
Proponents of the Bennett Hypothesis focus on federal funding, while conveniently forgetting that state support for higher education is itself a form of public funding. On a per-student basis, state funding for higher education is on a 30-year backslide, and the Great Recession crippled state higher education budgets in particular.33
Again, to the extent that financial aid may contribute to college price increases, evidence primarily exists at private and for-profit colleges. Meanwhile, the “culprit” is often increase in the ability to borrow for college, while grant aid targeted at low-income students is far less likely to result in tuition increases.34 In other words, lowering the price of college for students is not the problem anywhere, and certainly not at public institutions. So it follows that providing more grant aid, targeted at low-income students, not only makes college more affordable for those who need it the most, but is very unlikely to harm high-income students who do not get it. 
This argument is also odd in the case of debt-free college, because any proposal—including that set forth by Secretary Clinton—requires colleges to lower the price for students, particularly those from low- and middle-income families, in order to receive any federal subsidy. In other words, the money from the federal government must go toward lowering tuition and removing the need to borrow. So it’s virtually impossible for this new subsidy to increase the price that students pay.
 
Higher education in America is a decentralized system, with states and institutions holding substantial control over pricing, admissions, and structure of the education itself. Most federal financial aid acts as a voucher program to students, and is reactive to state and institutional decisions on cost. States can, and have, divested from higher education with impunity, while the federal role is essentially to provide students with a subsidy (a Pell Grant) or a line of credit (a student loan) to meet the resulting cost of college. But the proposals for debt-free college, including plans put forward by Demos and Secretary Clinton, often build on the concept of a federal-state partnership, in which states would receive funding from the federal government in return for meeting one or two conditions—namely, lowering the price for students so they can work their way through school with a modest part-time job.
One worry that some have about a new federal-state partnership for debt-free college is that states will simply not take new federal funding, regardless of how generous it is. While logic would dictate that cash-strapped states will accept “free money” from the federal government, some cite the recent Medicaid expansion in the Affordable Care Act, in which governors often took a political stand and refused money to boost healthcare access for low-income households.35
There is real concern that intransigent states will cut off their nose to spite their face, but this seems less likely when it comes to higher education than in the more politically-fraught realm of Medicaid, which targets subsidies exclusively at the poor. First, access to education, and specifically higher education, is a bipartisan value. The best recent example is Tennessee, where a Republican Governor helped launch a program to pay any remaining community college tuition not covered by grant aid for the state’s high school graduates.36 Local initiatives to provide free community college have sprung up in 37 states as well.37 And when the Obama Administration announced its Race to the Top initiative to provide competitive grants for reforms in K-12 education, 40 states applied for the first round of funding, with even more applying in the second and third phases of the program.38 The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act also contained miniature provisions of a federal-state partnership to ensure that states did not decimate higher education funding too much in the aftermath of the financial crisis, and states responded by cutting at or near the level required to receive additional federal funds.39
For states that simply act irrationally, any policy could provide stopgaps so that students in those states are not left out. For example, public institutions in states that do not participate could apply for funds themselves in return for making an affordability, or debt-free, commitment. Or the federal government could match state need-based grant aid funds for students in states who do not participate, or boost Pell Grant awards for students at institutions that educate high numbers of low-income students. 
And unlike healthcare, families are much more likely to ask questions of governors and legislatures who choose to continue down the path of higher and higher tuition, especially when students in neighboring states enjoy the ability to work their way through college. The universality of debt-free college, which starts at the premise that no one should have to borrow for college, and subsidizes accordingly, creates the opportunity for a much broader political coalition that holds state policymakers to account.
 
There are currently over 4,000 institutions of higher education in the U.S. where students can use federal financial aid dollars.40 The concept of choice is baked into our system of colleges and universities, and underpins the federal financial aid system. Pell Grants, federal student loans, GI Bill benefits and other aid acts like a voucher, in which students can shop for colleges and take their federal aid package to any accredited college participating in those programs. 
In theory, this creates a market for education where institutions can compete on price, value, and other measures. Some private college presidents have argued that providing a debt-free public option would reduce choice and force some private colleges out of business, since they would not be able to compete with the more affordable options.41
But this simply does not jive with the history of higher education, and also relies on a notion of choice that simply does not exist. First, the U.S. has a long, rich tradition of private colleges and universities—particularly in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic. These colleges had little problem attracting students when there were public, debt-free, options up until the mid-1990s. The simple fact is that affordable, public higher education once existed side-by-side with private offerings, but the decline in state funding has meant that public colleges now resemble high-priced private colleges themselves. The fact also remains that the Pell Grant, GI Bill funding, Federal Work Study and other aid is available to students at these colleges, in addition to favorable tax status. In short, a great deal of federal funds flows to private colleges and universities—an extension of our belief in student choice.
In practice though, choice is limited to a subset of elite students choosing to attend selective institutions (be they public or private). Over three-in-four students attend a public college or university, and the vast majority of those attend college in their home state.42 Students attend a median distance of 51 miles for college, and first-generation students travel even shorter distances from home.43 In short, we cannot assume that students will travel if the most affordable option is far away from home.  Students need an affordable, quality option nearby.
It is true that there are many private non-profit institutions, particularly Minority Serving Institutions, which enroll and graduate high numbers of low-income students and students of color. Many of these colleges cannot rely on high endowment funds—much of which is the result of systemic racial biases and the racial wealth gap.44 These institutions should absolutely be given the opportunity to remain affordable for the students they serve, and the federal government should provide additional incentive funds for the private institutions that excel at enrolling and graduating students of color and those from low-wealth households. Secretary Clinton’s New College Compact, for example, would provide a new fund for these institutions, ensuring that there is attention paid to those colleges that do heroic work in churning out graduates of color in particular.45
Meanwhile, many wealthy private institutions simply do a poor job of enrolling high numbers of needy students. According to a recent Education Trust report, nearly half of the 138 highest-endowment colleges rank in the bottom five percent of enrolling Pell Grant recipients, and most charge very high net prices to low-income students.46 It is unclear why we should extend new federal dollars to institutions that could enroll and provide a debt-free guarantee to more students with their own tax-advantaged endowment money or through other private fundraising.
 
We are in a moment of big, generation-defining debate on how we provide access to affordable education, and what the role of states, the federal government, and institutions should be in ensuring we increase college attainment. The current system is clearly unsustainable, and we must encourage healthy debate over big solutions to address it. But while the debate around debt-free college has been robust, clearly many on all sides are talking past each other, based on faulty or incomplete information on the intentions or actual structures of the policy solutions being proposed. ",policy-briefs
"14 Big Ideas to Build a Strong & Diverse Middle Class
Widely shared middle-class prosperity has made the United States the most hopeful and dynamic country on earch and is a foundation of a strong democracy.
Yet today, America’s middle class is in trouble: the traditional routes into the middle class have become more difficult to travel and security has eroded for those already in the middle class. Major economic and policy changes over the past three decades have widened economic inequality and reduced mobility in ways that go far beyond the impact of the recent recession. Too many people who play by the rules and do everything right find that they cannot climb into the middle class—or stay there. To meet this challenge, Millions to the Middle offers dramatic public policy initiatives to rebuild and grow the nation’s middle class.
We aim to accomplish two broad interrelated goals: to ensure that all Americans have a chance to move into the middle class and, second, to ensure greater security for those in the middle class. The 14 policies we offer are rooted in mainstream American values and able to command strong public support over the long term. Together, they go beyond the confines of the current policy debates and are of sufficient scale to firmly establish a middle-class America.
Our policy agenda is based on the three broad pillars of middle-class opportunity and security: investments in human capital and education; support for growth, job creation, and career development; and helping Americans build assets.

"The Debt-Free College Act of 2018 would create a new federal-state partnership that re-funds our neglected system of public colleges and job training.
Americans believe that we all benefit when we invest in our talent, that our country is better when everyone, regardless of their background, has a pathway toward affordable, quality higher education.1 Unfortunately, too many students today are blocked from following their dreams, or building their financial futures, because of high college prices and burdensome loan debt. Gone are the days when most students could cobble together sufficient grant aid, work enough hours, or rely on modest family savings to fully fund their education, even at a public 2- or 4-year college. As states have failed to meet increased student demand with greater public investment, prices have skyrocketed at community colleges and public 4-year schools alike. Simultaneously, states and the federal government have failed to provide enough grant aid for low-income students to meet rising costs. The result has been college bills that, even after grants and scholarships, can equal nearly a year’s worth of family income for the working class2 and create the near-universal need to borrow for a degree from a public college or university—the institutions that educate 3 out of every 4 American students and workers.
 
High prices and the prospect of debt impacts our country’s working-class students and students of color most acutely. Some students suppress their college aspirations for fear of taking on excess debt, while others drop out primarily due to the burden of tuition bills, the need to work while in school or take care of family, and other financial needs that do not disappear just because they are pursuing an education.3 Meanwhile, students of color—even those with a college degree—face far greater difficulty than white students repaying loans, and experience higher rates of default and loan balances that balloon well beyond the amount they originally took out.4
Nearly every state has room to improve in terms of its investment and commitment to making public 2- and 4-year college affordable.5 Simultaneously, investments in our nation’s network of Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges and Universities, and Hispanic Serving Institutions have not reflected the outsized role these institutions play in providing access and opportunities to students of color.
Students deserve a chance to build lifelong skills, retrain for a job, and pursue their dreams, regardless of their family’s financial circumstances. It is essential for our economy and our democracy that we make the same commitment to this generation of students that previous generations enjoyed.
The Debt-Free College Act of 2018 makes that necessary commitment. The bill, introduced by Sen. Brian Schatz (D-HI) and Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI-2) would create a new federal-state partnership that re-funds our neglected system of public colleges and job training, while giving students the freedom and flexibility to follow their dreams without the specter of high tuition bills or burdensome loan debt. The bill prioritizes working-class families, extends the commitment to students at both public and private Minority Serving Institutions, restores eligibility for federal financial aid for those with non-violent drug offenses, and gives Dreamers a chance to receive much-needed federal Pell Grant eligibility.
Original co-sponsors include Senators Gillibrand, Booker, Harris, Merkley, Warren, Brown, Blumenthal, & Baldwin and Representatives Chu, Clarke, Crowley, DeLauro, DeSaulnier, Ellison, Gomez, Grijalva, Holmes Norton, Hu man, Jackson-Lee, Khanna, Lee, Maloney, Moore, Napolitano, Nolan, Pallone, Pocan, Raskin, Takano, Watson-Coleman, and Welch.
 
Per-student state appropriations for higher education have still not recovered from the Great Recession, and per-student funding for public colleges has generally declined over the past several decades.6 The Debt-Free College Act tackles this long-standing divestment of public colleges by introducing an ambitious state-federal partnership program that makes debt-free college a possibility for all students.
Under the Partnership, states would receive a one-to-one federal match to their higher education appropriations in exchange for a commitment to help students pay for the full costs of attendance without having to take on debt. States that participate in the Partnership would commit to maintaining funding for public 2- and 4-year colleges and providing need-based grants to cover students’ cost of attendance that their families cannot afford, with the goal of advancing debt-free college for all in-state students within 5 years of joining the partnership. The Partnership also enables participating states to allocate a portion of their federal grant (up to 10 percent) toward building capacity and improving educational quality, such as increasing class offerings, investing in student support services, and repairing campus infrastructure, all of which would benefit long-underfunded community colleges in particular.
 
The Partnership prioritizes working-class students by requiring states to first cover any unmet need for Pell Grant recipients. This is in keeping with the original intent of the Pell Grant, which was designed to cover the price of college and put low-income students on equal footing with their wealthier peers. Remaining funds can then be used to reduce or eliminate debt for other eligible students, as well as build capacity and increase educational quality.
Additionally, the Partnership also extends federal Pell grant eligibility to Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)-eligible students, or Dreamers, so that they can afford to attend college. And the bill would also end the inequitable practice of asking about drug-related convictions on the free application for federal student aid (FAFSA), a practice that has caused confusion and potentially kept many students of color from receiving Pell Grants or other aid to which they were eligible, or worse, not enrolling in higher education at all.7
The Partnership’s commitment to debt-free college extends to public and private non-profit Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), including Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges and Universities and Hispanic Serving Institutions. While public MSIs would effectively be covered under the partnership, the bill also acknowledges the role that private non-profit institutions play in supporting upward mobility for students of color. For such institutions that serve at least 35 percent low-income students (defined by eligibility to receive Pell Grants), the Partnership includes a grant program to reduce or eliminate the need to borrow for college.
 
At each point in America’s history, investing in public colleges has proven to be wise, from the creation of land-grant colleges in the 19th century and community colleges in the 20th century, to the post-World War II GI Bill, which returned $7 to our economy for every $1 invested. The international Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimates that the total net public gain of supporting public higher education ranges between $75,000 and $200,000 per student in the United States.8 Ending an era in which students drop out of higher education for no other reason than high prices and debt, in which affordable college only exists for the wealthy, and where the barrier of burdensome debt prevents people from engaging all facets of the American dream, is both necessary and achievable. A bold investment in public colleges like the Debt-Free College Partnership Act will allowing students to once again work their way through school while helping rebuild an inclusive, dynamic middle class.",policy-briefs
"New USCIS Guidance on Voter Registration at Naturalization Ceremonies
In October of 2011, the United States Citizen and Immigration Services (USCIS) revised its guidelines regarding the provision of voter registration applications at naturalization ceremonies; and for the first time ever, the USCIS has committed to providing the opportunity to apply to register at every single administrative naturalization ceremony in the country.
Voter Registration for New Americans outlines what this milestone means for new citizens, election administrators, voter registration groups, and USCIS officials:",policy-briefs
"Virginia legislators are considering several bills that would make it more difficult for eligible persons to cast a ballot that will be counted, and would impose large costs for implementation. One bill requires photo identification in order to vote, while others require one of an enumerated list of identification documents. If the voter does not have identification he must sign a sworn statement of his identity and then cast a provisional ballot.
Current law allows such voters to vote an official rather than provisional ballot after affirming their identity. The legislature is also considering requiring that these provisional ballots be counted in a closed door, secret meeting providing no accountability to the public. Other bills require proof of U.S. citizenship and photo ID to register to vote in person, by mail, and through DMV and assistance agencies.
Governor Robert McDonnell has proposed deep cuts that will create real hardships for people in Virginia. Over 90 percent of the cuts are in the areas of education and health care. They include:
 
While requirements for voter ID may sound reasonable at first glance, the bills being pushed in Virginia go beyond any reasonable requirements and are far too restrictive and expensive to deserve support.
A restrictive photo ID law and proof of citizenship registration requirement could disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of Virginians. Large numbers of American citizens – disproportionately among certain demographic groups – do not possess a valid, government-issued photo ID, or the documents required to get a photo ID.
Eleven percent of American citizens do not have government-issued photo identification. If the same is true for Virginia, a photo ID requirement for voting will disenfranchise over 600,000 Virginians. In addition, 10 percent of citizens nationally who have photo identification don’t have ID with both their current address and their current legal name, which would disenfranchise an additional over 554,000 thousand Virginians.
The elderly, persons of color, young people and low-income voters are much less likely to have government-issued photo identification than the rest of the population, and younger voters with ID are less likely to have ID with their current addresses and legal names.
Requiring proof of citizenship when someone registers to vote is also highly burdensome. A national survey found that 7 percent of U.S. citizens do not have a birth certificate, passport, or naturalization certificate readily available. Assuming that 7 percent share is the same in Virginia as in the nation as a whole, an estimated 388,114 Virginians would not be able to register to vote without the burden of having to track down – and pay for – replacement documents. This burden will fall hardest on particular populations.
Allowing voters without a sanctioned ID to vote a provisional ballot is not a good answer. For a variety of reasons that depend on the discretion of local election officials, provisional ballots are frequently not counted. In 2010, only 42 percent of the provisional ballots cast in Virginia were counted fully, while 56.8 percent of provisional ballots cast were not counted. This is much worse than the national average. Provisional ballots are not a solution.
If the photo ID and proof of citizenship laws were to pass, there are significant fiscal costs that Virginia would have to bear in order for the laws to have the possibility of withstanding a constitutional challenge. Missouri estimated its costs for a proposed photo ID law at $6 million for the first year and $4 million per year thereafter. Indiana spent $12.2 million over four years implementing its voter ID law. Virginia has hundreds of thousands more voters than Missouri or Indiana, and can expect to incur even higher costs to meet the standards for implementation required by the courts.
Virginia charges between $12 and $32 for a driver’s license, and $10 for an identification card.The state would be required to provide free IDs for any Virginia citizens who need it in order to vote. The Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles issued nearly three-quarters of a million free photo IDs from 2007-2010. Indiana had to spend over $10 million to provide the IDs, significantly more than it had budgeted.
It is costly and time-consuming to collect the documents necessary for obtaining a “free” state photo ID. To get a driver’s license or identification card Virginians are required to present two proofs of identity, one proof of Virginia residency, one proof of legal presence in the U.S., and, if applicable, one proof of social security number, all of which may cost money to obtain. Some of the bills being considered would require proof of citizenship to register to vote. Obtaining a passport costs $100, naturalization papers cost $380, and birth certificates cost $12 in Virginia. The Missouri Supreme Court struck down that state’s photo ID law under the Missouri Constitution, finding that the costs of obtain- ing the documents necessary to get a photo ID constituted an illegal poll tax. Further, to obtain a birth certificate a voter has to show particular forms of identification, which could create an insurmountable Catch-22, effectively stripping citizens of their ability to vote.
IDs must be readily available to all voters, the state may need to expand the numbers and operational hours of Virginia’s DMVs to provide appropriate access. Currently, many Virginia DMV offices are not open on the weekend, and don’t have evening hours. This could increase the Virginia DMV budget. This may also entail creating mobile ID centers to ensure voters, such as those in nursing homes and those with disabilities can obtain IDs.
If a state chooses to enact photo ID or proof of citizenship requirements it is constitutionally bound to undertake a lengthy, extensive public education campaign to inform voters of the new requirements. In 2010, Missouri estimated it would cost $16.9 million for TV, radio and newspaper announcements and other outreach to the state’s 4 million voters. The Institute for Southern Studies estimated it could cost North Carolina $14 million or more over three years to inform its 6 million voters. Virginia has 5,032,521 registered voters, and there is no reason to think that a program to reach them would be any less expensive.
States are responsible for identifying and targeting populations of eligible voters without IDs to assist them in obtaining the necessary IDs. In order to ensure this was satisfied for Georgia’s voters, the Secretary of State’s office sent mailings over multiple election cycles to the hundreds of thousands of voters believed to lack drivers licenses. The Secretary of State also aired public service announcements extensively on radio and television informing voters of the photo ID requirement. Information was distributed to public libraries and other public facilities across the state, as well as through a partnership with the utility companies. All of this imposes costs on stretched state budgets.
The implementation costs should not be underestimated. They will require long-term attention for months before elections, and will continue up to and including Election Day, putting heavy burdens on the 2,363 precincts statewide.They may include: modifying the statewide voter registration database; purchasing necessary equipment; updating registration forms; updating websites; redesigning provisional ballot envelopes; and, providing more provisional ballots and envelopes. Statewide training on changes will be necessary, including new absentee ballot and provisional ballot scenarios. These new bureaucratic hurdles may also require the hiring of additional staff to prepare and process the increased paperwork.
In Iowa, a bi-partisan group of county election administrators opposed a photo ID bill as an “unfunded mandate” on counties, who would bear the burden of educating the public and implementing the requirements. In Wisconsin, the head of the municipal clerks association testified as to how much of a strain the photo ID bill then under consideration would put on the local officials, and said if it was passed they would have to choose between spending resources to implement it or on providing services, positions and machinery for emergency operations in a timely manner.
Defending these laws is costly. Many of the states that have sought to impose burdensome restrictions on voting rights have had to spend years in court attempting to defend the law. Courts repeatedly ruled that inadequate public education efforts invalidated the Georgia voter ID law.
The parts of Virginia that are subject to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act will have to undergo pre- clearance. Since these laws have discriminatory impacts on minority and other vulnerable populations it will take significant resources to attempt to defend these laws, with little prospect of success. It is estimated that South Carolina may spend over $1 million in its suit against the U.S. Department of Justice, which refused to pre-clear the state’s photo ID law.
Current state law allows voters who don’t have identification to sign an affidavit swearing that they are the registered voter they claim to be, under penalty of law. Perjury is a felony in Virginia, and punishments range from imprisonment for up to a decade to potentially thousands of dollars in fines. These substantial deterrents have effectively protected the integrity of Virginia’s elections.
Virginia legislators pushing these bills cite the need to guard against voter fraud. Despite the constant drumbeat in the last several years causing an atmosphere of fear and acute awareness around this issue, numerous high level investigations have found there has been no evidence of anything but isolated instances of fraud.

"A Policy Proposal to Increase College Access and Affordability
Rising college costs, combined with major policy changes in financial aid, have made college less affordable for today’s generation of young people.
The Contract for College would unify the existing three strands of federal financial aid — grants, loans and work-study — into a coherent, guaranteed financial aid package for students.

"Strong voter participation and engagement are fundamental to a healthy democracy.  Efforts to restrict access to voting fly in the face of this important goal.  Alarmingly, despite another midterm election in which nationally only 41 percent of eligible persons voted, many states are now renewing efforts to restrict, rather than expand, the franchise. 
The timing could not be more inappropriate. Incoming legislators and governors are pushing the passage of strict voter identification laws while their states face critical budget crises. Instead of focusing on job creation and providing relief for millions of unemployed and underemployed residents, legislators have placed a law that would disenfranchise tens of thousands at the top of their agendas.
Missouri is One of Those States
Missouri is considering a bill requiring all voters to present government issued photo identification at the polls. The fact that Missouri is introducing a restrictive voter identification bill is particularly unfortunate considering the legislature passed such a bill in 2006 and it was struck down as unconstitutional under the state's constitution by the Missouri Supreme Court.  The Court said it violated the fundamental right to vote as provided by the state constitution.  Somehow, this has not deterred some legislators from trying to needlessly disenfranchise voters once again.  At the same time, they are trying to pass a bill that would amend the state's constitution to require voters show voter ID.  This proposal would bypass the wisdom of the state's constitutional drafters by enshrining an anti-democratic, discriminatory measure into the state's very foundational document.
Under the bill, voters who do not have a form of government issued photo ID may complete an affidavit averring that they do not have the required ID and vote provisionally, but only if they have a physical or mental disability or handicap, swear they are unable to pay for documentation that would be required to get identification, have a religious belief against it, or were born before 1941. The bill requires the state to provide at least one form of personal ID at no cost to voters who do not have other forms of ID. 
The acceptable forms of ID are extremely limited:
Any other forms of ID, such as college IDs and out-of-state IDs, would not be accepted and therefore, many students and mobile residents would have to resort to casting a provisional ballot and somehow verify their identity at a later time for their vote to count. Missouri citizens who do not have any of the IDs listed above must go through an arduous process of acquiring one at the Department of Revenue (DOR) in order to vote.

Kansas is considering a bill to require all voters to present government issued photo identification at the polls. Free IDs are provided only after the applicant signs an affirmation that he or she receives government assistance or earns at or less than 150% of the poverty rate. Everyone else must pay $14. Under previous federal court opinion, this provision makes the Kansas ID bill an unconstitutional poll tax. The bill goes even further than other states by also requiring that in order to register to vote, all Kansans must present proof of American citizenship.  This means presenting a driver's license, birth certificate, passport, naturalization documents or a tribal card.
Kansas faces a budget gap of $492 million for Fiscal Year 2012. To address the shortfall, Governor Brownback proposed a government spending freeze and the elimination of eight (unspecified) government agencies on his first day in office. Governor Brownback has proposed limiting spending to ""[t]hose areas we're really trying to protect - the core functions of state government,"" promising to focus on education and public safety spending as immediate budget priorities.
Yet the Voter ID proposal would divert funds from those core functions of government and likely require millions in new government spending over the next several years.

In the crucial battleground states of Ohio and Wisconsin, 145 anonymous billboards noting that voter fraud is a felony punishable by up to 3.5 years in prison and a $10,000 fine popped up in predominately African America urban areas around Milwaukee, Cleveland, and Columbus two weeks before the 2012 election. The signs were designed with large white letters reading “VOTER FRAUD IS A FELONY! Up to 3 ½ years & $10,000 Fine!” with a big picture of a judge’s gavel.1
The selective placement of these billboards belies any argument that they were merely intended to be informative. They are instead an example of voter intimidation meant to discourage potential voters of color through scare tactics. Recent elections have also seen a rise in coordinated incidents of phone calls targeting voters that misrepresent times and locations of voting, policies and endorsements of particular candidates,2 and flyers, mailer, and billboards that misinform, discourage, and intimidate targeted voters.
Deceptive practices are intentional disseminations of false or misleading information about the voting process in order to prevent an eligible voter from casting a ballot, such as providing misinformation about when and where to vote.3 Voter intimidation is the use of threats, coercion, harassment or other improper tactics to interfere with the free exercise of the right to vote.4 5 Voters of color are disproportionally targeted for misinformation and intimidation tactics.6 7 These tactics endanger the integrity of our elections and impede an individual’s fundament right to vote.8

"Expanding Voter Registration of Low-Income Citizens Under the National Voter Registration Act of 1993
While the United States has come a long way in expanding the franchise over the past 220 years, barriers to participation still exist and these barriers disproportionately impact low-income citizens. In 2008, over 11 million low-income adult citizens remained unregistered to vote and the registration gap between low-income and high-income citizens was over 19 percentage points.
Research by Demos and its partners demonstrates that the compliance gaps found in states such as Missouri, North Carolina and Virginia reflect a nationwide problem.

"America's students are facing a serious threat from subprime private loans, and the situation could worsen unless Congress votes to close a potential loophole in the proposed Consumer Financial Protection Agency (CFPA), according to a new study published by Demos, the U.S. Public Interest Research Group (US PIRG), and the United States Students Association.
The briefing paper shows that aggressively-marketed, loosely-regulated private loans are miring an increasing number of students in unnecessary debt. A startling 67 percent of the U.S. bachelor's degree graduates last year had student debt, averaging about $23,200 per indebted student. While most of that debt is in safer, lower-interest federal loans, a significant amount is in private loans that can carry interest rates of over 18 percent. It also shows that nearly 3 million American students took out private loans last year, up from less than 1 million just four years before.

"Early voting provides a means for eligible voters to cast their ballots at a time and location other than in person on Election Day.
Voters can cast a ballot by appearing in person at a local elections office or other designated location during a designated period prior to Election Day.
voters submit their ballots via mail or by dropping them off at designated locations. Voters simply apply for and receive an absentee ballot in the days or weeks before Election Day. Ideally, absentee ballots are available to any eligible voter, without requiring a narrowly defined reason or “excuse” to obtain and vote an absentee ballot.
For shortening wait times for voting and reducing burdens on polling place officials. It is popular among both voters and election administrators as a means to protect the freedom to vote. Some form of early voting already exists in two- thirds of states.1
Wait times in excess of one hour were not uncommon on Election Day in 2012, and some voters reported waiting in lines for up to four hours.2 By spreading voting over a longer time period, early voting can help relieve the burden of long lines and wait times on Election Day.3
Early in-person and no-excuse absentee voting can provide significant relief to poll workers at crowded polling centers on Election Day.4
 
Academics continue to study the impact of early voting on turnout. Nevertheless, usage of early voting has recently surged among traditionally underrepresented voters. The 2008 election marked a dramatic increase in early in-person voting among African American and Latino voters.4 And in Florida, where approximately 50% of ballots were cast early in 2012,5 African-American usage of early in-person voting has exceeded White usage in four of the five most recent federal elections.6 Research suggests that turnout increases are maximized when early voting is combined with Same Day Registration.7
Two-thirds of states now offer some form of early voting, and it is popular in places that have it.8 In nine states, more than thirty percent of voters used early voting.9 Election officials have supported its adoption.10 And following the 2012 elections, elected officials across the country have called for improved access to early voting.11 As President Obama said regarding long lines on Election Day, “we have to fix that.”12
The number, type, and distribution of in-person voting locations currently vary by state, affecting individuals’ ability to vote early. To ensure that long lines do not interfere with the right to vote, states and political subdivisions must ensure that in-person early voting sites are sufficiently numerous, convenient, and equitably located.
Some states restrict absentee early voting only to those who can demonstrate narrow categories of “excuse” or cause for not voting on Election Day, such as being entirely absent from the city or county.13 This does not take into account the work schedules and family responsibilities of many citizens. States should permit any registered voter to request an absentee ballot, without limitation (so-called “no excuse” absentee voting).
The time period for early voting varies from state to state. Some states begin early voting as much as 45 days before the election. The average is about 19 days before Election Day.14 It is important that Election Day remain a focal point and that early voting continue through the weekend before the election. We recommend a 14-day period to help maximize early voting opportunities without placing an undue burden on election officials.",policy-briefs
"One of the chief impediments to full voter participation is our unnecessarily cumbersome process of voter registration. Barriers are in place from the very beginning of the process, including requiring citizens to actively register to vote and to continually update their registration each time they move. Above and beyond the requirement to register, most states cut off registration to potential voters in the month just before Election Day.1 This means that eligible voters who do not register under the arbitrarily set deadlines will not be able to vote. 
Return to the full Millions to the Polls report for more pro-voter policies
People miss registration deadlines for a number of reasons, including having recently moved or being unaware of the cutoff date. As a result, millions of eligible people are unable to participate in elections. The number of unregistered voters is substantial— in 2012, 25 percent of eligible voters, roughly 51 million Americans, were not registered.23 Moreover, even those who do register in advance can find themselves left off the rolls on election day because of mistakes in processing or flawed voter purges.  
There is a simple solution that can help increase registration rates, and in turn, voting rates. Same Day Registration (SDR) allows eligible voters to register to vote and cast their ballots on the same day, at the same time. SDR reduces voting bureaucracy by eliminating registration deadlines, allows registration issues to be fixed on site, and modernizes our registration process to better serve our the needs of a busy and mobile society. 
Far from being an untested idea, SDR is a tried and true method to fix registration issues and increase voter turnout. SDR was pioneered by Maine, Minnesota, and Wisconsin in the early-to-mid 1970s.4 In the last decade, the number of SDR states has more than doubled from six to thirteen, plus the District of Columbia.5 In just the last five years, Same Day Registration was adopted in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Iowa, Maryland, Montana, North Carolina, and the District of Columbia, though it has recently been repealed in North Carolina.6
These states’ experience with SDR shows that it works. States with Same Day Registration consistently lead the nation in voter participation and the average voter turnout was over 10 percentage points higher in SDR states than in other states in 2012.7 Four out of five of the states with the highest turnout in the 2012 election allowed people to register and vote on the same day – Minnesota, Wisconsin, New Hampshire, and Iowa.8 Overall, nearly 1.5 million Americans used Same Day Registration to vote in the 2012 election.9

Same Day Registration also offers those who have recently moved an opportunity to register and vote with their new address. Geographically mobile voters, who are often lower-income citizens, young voters, and voters of color,10 are not a small population. Census data shows that over 36 million people in America moved between 2011 and 2012, nearly half of whom had low incomes.11 In addition, young adults of all income levels also move more frequently—for school, for jobs, for family. SDR could increase youth turnout in presidential elections by as much as 14 percentage points.12 It can also increase voter participation among all voters of color,13 as borne out by the experience of North Carolina (see sidebar).
Same Day Registration also reduces the need and use of provisional ballots. Provisional ballots are offered to citizens who believe they are registered but whose names do not appear on voter rolls. But a provisional ballot frequently does not translate into a ballot that counts. Almost a third of provisional ballots cast in 2012 were rejected for a number of reasons, including voters missing the registration deadline or voting in the wrong precinct—issues that could be fixed at the polling place with SDR.14
Allowing eligible voters to register and vote on the same day greatly reduces the need for provisional ballots because eligible voters can just re-register if there are any issues. This freedom saves elections officials the time and expense of processing many provisional votes. After SDR was adopted in Iowa, provisional ballots dropped from 15,000 in the 2004 presidential election to less than 5,000 in 2008—a 67 percent decline.15 North Carolina saw 23,000 fewer provisional ballots after it adopted SDR in 2008.16
In addition to increasing voter participation and reducing provisional ballots, Same Day Registration is also very cost effective. Iowa and North Carolina reported minimal costs when introducing SDR in the 2008 presidential election.17 The state of Iowa spent less than $40,000 to introduce SDR for its 99 counties.18 North Carolina’s counties cited some additional staffing needs at voting sites as the most notable expense associated with Same Day Registration.19 It is not just newly implemented programs that are cost effective. In a telephone survey conducted by Demos of local election officials in states with the longest experience with SDR- Idaho, Maine, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Wisconsin, and Wyoming- most respondents described the incremental cost of SDR as “minimal.”20 Whatever costs arose were offset by savings from reducing the number of provisional ballots needed and reducing staff costs associated with last-minute processing of registrations just before the pre-election deadline.21
Finally, the use of SDR does not compromise the integrity of our elections. States offering SDR report that existing fraud-prevention measures ensure the integrity of elections,22 and elections officials familiar with SDR strongly endorse it. Mark Ritchie, Minnesota’s long-time Secretary of State said, “Election Day Registration is much more secure because you have the person right in front of you­—not a postcard in the mail. That is a no brainer. We [Minnesota] have 33 years of doing this”23 Debbye Lathrop, the County Clerk in Laramie County, Wyoming said, “I think Election Day voter registration gives every citizen the greatest opportunity to participate in the greatest right that they have been provided.”24
Unfortunately, the attack on voting rights has included attempts to dismantle this successful tool for political participation. Conservative political leaders in several states have moved to repeal Same Day Registration in recent years.25 Voters in Maine defeated repeal efforts in 2011. An SDR repeal bill was vetoed by Montana’s Governor Schweitzer in 2011, but the legislature has placed an SDR repeal question on the ballot in November 2014. 
As part of its recent rollback of voting rights North Carolina ended its highly successful Same Day Registration program, in addition to enacting a strict photo ID requirement (e.g. no student ID), shortening the early voting period, and eliminating pre-registration for 16 and 17-year-olds.26 This was widely seen as an attempt to stymy increased participation by voters of color—41 percent of North Carolinians who used SDR to register and vote in the 2012 elections were African Americans, though blacks represent just 20 percent of the voting age population.27
 
To maximize voter participation gains, Same Day Registration should be available at all polling places and should be offered during the early voting period and through Election Day.
States have developed common-sense ways to organize the polling place to accommodate Same Day Registration efficiently and effectively. In particular:

"10 Ways Student Debt Is Blocking the Economic Mobility of Young Americans
America’s experiment with the debt-for-diploma system has officially failed. Total student loan debt in the U.S. now tops $1 trillion – an unprecedented sum that represents the unprecedented obstacles students and recent graduates face in their pursuit of the American Dream.
Over the last several decades, our nation slowly and steadily shifted the burden of paying for college from a public responsibility to a private one, leaving most students with debt and leaving many potential students behind. As state funding declined and tuition at state universities rose in response, federal financial aid has shifted from making college affordable through grants to lower income students to providing loans that simply help families finance a college degree. 
It’s time to renew our commitment to an accessible and affordable higher education system in the United States. Debt is not financial aid—it allows students to pay for college but also raises the cost of a degree because all student loans, especially private loans, include interest charges and origination fees. The need for student loans has also created a very lucrative market for the private lenders and banks who, until 2010, profited from guarantees through the federal student loan system and who are benefiting today from the demand for financing beyond the federal loan program.
As activists across the country protest the debt-for-diploma system and its $1 trillion mark, below are the top ten reasons why our nation must embark on a new strategy to make college affordable as opposed to merely financeable through student loans.
1. From 1990 to 2010, state funding for public higher education fell 26.1 percent per full-time equivalent student, a major driver of rapidly rising tuition rates. Over the past 20 years there has been a breakdown in the historical funding pattern of recessionary cuts and expansionary rebounds. The length of time for higher education funding to recover following recessions has lengthened for every downturn since 1979 with early evidence suggesting that the recovery from the Great Recession will be no different.

2. In 1980, 39 percent of federal financial aid to undergraduates was in the form of loans, and 55 percent was awarded in grants. By 2008, this had shifted to 64 percent of the funds awarded as loans and only 26 percent as grants. Moreover, today’s maximum Pell Grant covers just over a third of the costs of attending a public 4-year university, down from over two-thirds in 1980.

3. A lack of public investment has resulted in tuition more than tripling at public 4-year universities between 1980 and 2010.
 
4. The demand for costly private student loans, often driven by aggressive and deceptive marketing by for-profit 2-year colleges, has swelled substantially in just a few years.  Private loan volume grew from $6.5 billion in 2003-04 to $17.1 billion in 2007-08.
5. Unlike any other type of unsecured loan, private student loans are now nearly impossible to discharge in bankruptcy—a major policy change successfully lobbied for by the student loan industry. The Fairness for Struggling Students Act, proposed last year by Senator Richard Durbin, would fix this unnecessary burden for students, yet it currently remains tied up in committee.
6. In the 2007-2008 academic year, 66 percent of community college students and 46 percent of students at four-year institutions worked more than 20 hours per week to finance their education—an amount of working hours that leads to greater drop-out rates among college students.
7. As aid shrinks and costs rise, college completion becomes increasingly difficult: Surveys of students who have left college without earning a credential routinely cite employment and finances as the main reasons for student departure. One study found that nearly 40 percent of students who worked full time while enrolled dropped out within three years, compared to 19 percent of students who worked part time and 13 percent who did not work.
8. Today, two-thirds of students graduate with debt, at an average of $24,842. African Americans are much more likely to rely on debt to finance their degree and borrow at higher amounts, averaging $28,692.

9. From 2007 to 2009, student loan default rates increased by nearly one-third: In 2009, 15 percent of graduates from for-profit colleges were in default. A March 2012 report from the New York Federal Reserve confirmed that 30 percent of student loan borrowers currently have past-due balances of 30 days or more.
10. The shift toward privatizing the costs of public higher education is one of the contributors to the Unites States falling behind other advanced nations in college attainment: The United States has the best educated older population in the world but among 25-34 year olds, we rank 10th.",policy-briefs
"An overview of the bureaucratic barriers to becoming—and remaining—registered to vote
Former U.S. Representative Lincoln Davis, of Tennessee, knows something about elections and government, yet this year when he went to polls in his hometown where he’d been voting since 1995, he was denied the right to vote.
“We walked in and they told me I was not a registered voter. I had been taken off the list . . . These are people who I grew up with. I told them I live here. I went to school about 20 yards away. . . .It’s always been this way and today, for some reason, they change it. I had a sense of uneasiness when I was told that I was not allowed to vote. They didn’t offer me a provisional ballot, or anything, just told me I wasn’t registered. . . . He said I would have to re-register, and I told them I’m already registered, I’m not going to re-register. I’m a former member of Congress, state senator, House member, mayor and all my life, I’ve been involved in the community, coaching Little League, participating in Boy Scouts and serving on boards here, and I’m denied the right to vote. It just doesn’t make sense.”
Representative Davis had been improperly “purged” from the voting rolls. If it can happen to a former Congressman, it can happen to anyone.
All this makes clear that a major focus for increasing citizen participation in elections should be to decrease the bureaucratic barriers to becoming, and remaining, registered to vote. Americans deserve an election system that is much more responsive to their needs, and that facilitates their participation in democratic governance.
 
Many states still impose lengthy pre-election voter registration deadlines that may have been established decades ago, despite the proven effect of such deadlines in dampening voter participation.
Many citizens become most interested and engaged with the election in the last few weeks before Election Day, when candidate debates are taking place, just as registration deadlines may be closing in their state. Other voters who are already registered may lose eligibility merely because they move to a different neighborhood or county, or because of clerical errors with their registration, or because of flawed and erroneous pre-election challenges to a voter’s eligibility.If they fail to discover the problem prior to Election Day, when the registration deadline has passed, they may be unable to vote.
Eleven states, plus the District of Columbia, have now adopted Same Day Registration in order to ensure that eligible voters are not turned away because of errors with their registrations or failure to register in advance of Election Day.14 Same Day Registration eliminates arbitrary pre-election deadlines and allows voters to register and vote on the same day, making it a more convenient one-stop process and ensuring that eligible individuals who are not on the lists can register to vote, or correct inaccurate existing registration information. Same Day Registration means that voters no longer are without recourse when faced with registration problems that threaten their right to vote.
Same Day Registration increases political participation, without undue costs or administrative burdens. States that allow Same Day Registration have consistently led the nation in voter participation. Indeed, the top five states for voter turnout in 2008 all had Same Day Registration, and average voter turnout was seven percentage points higher in Same Day Registration states in the 2008 presidential elections. North Carolina witnessed the greatest increase in voter turnout over the previous presidential election, one year after Same Day Registration was adopted.
Experts have projected substantial voter turnout increases in states that have considered adopting Same Day Registration, with average voting projected to rise by over 4 to nearly 9 percent. Even greater increases are estimated for young people, low-income populations, people of color, newly naturalized citizens, and those who have recently changed residences.
Same Day Registration is so popular with voters that an overwhelming majority of Maine citizens used a so-called “People’s Veto” on the November 2011 ballot to reinstate Same Day Registration after the nearly forty-year old program was repealed by the state legislature.
The convenience and accessibility of Same Day Registration should be available to voters throughout the country. The Voter Empowerment Act of 2012, H.R. 5799, introduced by Rep. John Lewis and 140 co-sponsors, would provide for Same Day Registration throughout the country, along with many other pro-voter reforms.
 
The need to update registration when a person moves is another major source of red tape in our mobile society. Almost 36.5 million US residents moved between 2011 and 2012. Low-income individuals are twice as likely to move as those above the poverty line.  Young people, moreover, are more likely to move than any other demographic group; between 2011 and 2012, 21 percent of young adults between the ages of 18 and 24 moved.
Voter registration should become portable and permanent for persons who move within a state, by automatic updates to registration records as citizens change their address. Because all states now are required to have statewide voter registration databases, there should be no need for persons to register anew each time they move within a state. States such as Colorado and Minnesota have procedures that help voters keep their registration current when they move. Reforms to make voter registration portable and permanent for persons who move within a state also are part of The Voter Empowerment Act of 2012 that is pending in Congress.
 
Our current system is archaic and inefficient, and badly needs modernization. It still relies on handwritten, paper forms that that can result in clerical errors and is needlessly expensive for states to administer. It leaves the burden on the citizen to negotiate the registration process and to update her registration again and again each time she moves.
We need policy changes that put the responsibility for registering voters squarely on the government by automating the registration process. Under a modernized voter registration system, eligible citizens interacting with the government will be asked if they consent to being registered to vote, and will be added to the rolls through a paperless process if they do. This shifts the administrative burden off of the individual voter and onto the government to register eligible citizens to vote. Delaware has implemented a version of this by providing for paperless voter registration for persons interacting with the motor vehicle bureau or public assistance offices.",policy-briefs

"Proof that when laws to protect peoples’ democratic rights are put into practice, they can have a major impact on bringing more voices into the political process.
As public concern grows over deepening economic and political inequality, there’s good news to report in five states: 1 million additional members of the 99 percent have filled out voter registration forms at public assistance agencies since 2007.
This milestone reflects Demos’ work helping five states — Ohio, Missouri, North Carolina, Virginia and Illinois — to fully implement the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA), specifically the often-neglected public agency registration requirements, otherwise known as “Section 7”. It is proof that when laws to protect peoples’ democratic rights are put into practice, they can have a major impact on bringing more voices into the political process. If more states follow suit, millions of additional lower-income Americans will have the opportunity to participate in our democracy in coming years.
For the past several years, Demos and its partners have been working with state officials to properly implement Section 7 of the NVRA after finding that many states neglected their obligation to provide voter registration services to applicants and recipients of public assistance benefits. Congress intended these requirements to work in tandem with the more familiar “Motor Voter” provisions of the NVRA, under which voter registration is widely available at motor vehicle offices. By ensuring that eligible individuals from all walks of life could have convenient access to voter registration, the NVRA sought to encourage broad participation in voting.

"Give states additional Child Care and Development Block Grant funding to double the number of children served by child care assistance, make the federal Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit refundable, and expand Head Start and Early Head Start.
Child care and early education are vital to economic growth and future competitiveness. Working families need access to affordable and high-quality child care and preschool education in order to meet their families’ basic needs. At the same time, investing in child care also meets a national need by ensuring that children can develop their full potential to become critical thinkers and engaged citizens. 
There is substantial research indicating that birth to age 3 is a crucial time in a child’s development, impacting later school performance and life chances.1 For example, children who benefit from early care and education programs are less likely to engage in criminal behavior later in their lives and are more likely to graduate from high school and college. Higher graduation rates translate to higher incomes upon entering the labor force, the long-term benefits of which include higher tax revenue which might be considered a return on the public’s investment in that child. Multiple cost-benefit analyses conducted on three of the intensive educational programs that have been studied long term – Abecedarian, Perry Preschool, and ChildParent Center – have found that the public benefits far exceed the costs of the programs; benefits range from $6 to $13 for every $1 spent on the programs.2
Yet child care is exceedingly expensive: Demos and Young Invincibles’ “State of Young America” study reports that child care fees for two children (an infant and a 4 year-old) in a child care center exceeded annual median rent payments in every state in the U.S.3 The national average for center-based child care costs in 2010 was $8,900 for full-time care for an infant and $7,150 for full-time care for a preschooler.4 While well-off families can afford the type of good child care and education all children deserve, low-income and middle-class families often cannot, and may end up with lower-quality care or lose jobs as they juggle unstable child care situations. The federal Head Start program, aimed at families in poverty, reaches only about half of three- and four-year-olds from poor families and seldom provides the full-day care that parents trying to work their way into the middle class often need. Federal block grants that subsidize child care are inadequate, as are tax credits that aim to offset the cost burden for middle-class families. 
Accordingly, the Zero-16 Contract for Education includes a plan for affordable, high-quality child care which expands tax credits to low- and middle-income families, increases federal block grant funding allocated to child care assistance, provides resources to enhance the training of child care providers, sets up a system to monitor child care facilities for safety, and calls for specific techniques and approaches for improving the quality of child care services to families with limited English proficiency and children with special needs. It also expands public investment in Head Start and Early Head Start to ensure access to all low-income families interested in enrolling their children. A high-quality early care system would cost an estimated $88 billion a year.5
 
The early care and education component of the Zero-16 Contract for Education is based on a blueprint for affordable, high-quality child care developed by a coalition of national and state educators, advocates, and analysts.6 It will ensure all American children a strong start in life and enable them to begin school ready to learn.

"Helping Americans Build Assets
The below is one policy proposal from Demos' Millions to the Middle series. Other proposed policies include:
Home ownership is commonly understood as the quintessential marker of having arrived in the middle class: a family’s home is often the single largest asset that they own and has traditionally served as an important vehicle for wealth accumulation and economic security. 
Today, however, middle class neighborhoods are under assault from foreclosure. Approximately 29 percent of all families owe more on their home than the property itself it worth. If this trend continues, an estimated 14 million homes – 1 out of every 4 in the United States – will face foreclosure before the housing crisis is resolved.1
This large-scale upheaval will continue to devastate not only the families displaced from their homes but also the communities left behind in their wake – spikes in home vacancy lead not only to an increase in crime and social disorder2 but also a decrease in nearby property values, eroding the tax base for local municipalities and threatening the solvency of the essential public services necessary for a middle class life.3 In addition, the loss of housing wealth reduces consumer’s ability to spend and retards the economic recovery.
Today more than ever, American households need the leg up they never received: the middle class cannot continue to survive, much less grow, so long as local communities continue to decay and household assets are allowed to deteriorate. An effective reform of U.S. housing policy must achieve two goals: allow families to refinance their mortgages under more affordable terms, and expand credit availability for those looking to purchase a home who cannot access a mortgage in today’s excessively tight market.4
Unfortunately, the current political debate over housing policy has remained confined to a false choice between two unacceptable options: we must either let the market adjust itself, or offer voluntary incentives to encourage private lenders to modify distressed mortgages.5 The first of these options is unacceptable for the sheer devastation to American families and communities that it entails; the second has already proven far too timid of a response to address the depth of the problem before us. What is missing from this debate is the case for a strong public entity to directly defend the middle class’s access to homeownership by restructuring mortgage debt.
Such a public entity would have historic precedent. Consider the example of the last serious housing crisis in the United States: at the beginning of the Great Depression, a widespread economic contraction led to falling home prices, increasing numbers of underwater mortgages, and a rapid evaporation of household wealth.6 The Hoover administration responded to this with a level of timidity that resembles our current predicament: rather than supporting homeowners with direct public intervention, the Federal Home Loan Bank Act was established in 1932 to provide extra capital to banks to stimulate the private lending industry.7 With the limitations of a voluntary program, however, private lenders hesitated to act on their own initiative, and the program had an almost insignificant impact on the ailing housing market. 
Once Franklin Roosevelt took office, more aggressive action was taken to assist struggling home owners through the creation of the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation – a public entity empowered to directly re-finance distressed mortgages and offer low-interest, affordable mortgages to families that had already lost their homes. From 1933 to 1936, the HOLC refinanced or directly originated over 1 million mortgages in the United States, approximately 1 out of every 5 outstanding mortgages in the country at the time.8
The impact of this effort was enormous: the HOLC ensured that an entire generation of American homeowners did not slide into poverty while restoring their base of asset accumulation for the future. Moreover, by directly acquiring distressed mortgages from private lenders in exchange for government bonds, the HOLC provided a much stronger incentive for lenders to begin offering credit again to prospective homeowners, relative to the indirect incentives provided by the Hoover administration’s Loan Bank.9
By restoring the direct relationship between debtor and lender that has been lost through the use of collateralized debt obligations and other complex financial instruments, a 21st-century HOLC would be able to interact closely with borrowers and provide for the refinancing of their mortgages on a cooperative, case-by-case basis.
It is important, however, to note that the original HOLC focused exclusively on borrowers with comparatively strong credit backgrounds – while it refinanced around 1 million mortgages in total, it denied almost a million more. The beneficiaries of the original HOLC were homeowners who were only facing foreclosure because of the widespread economic contraction of the Depression, and a 21st-century HOLC would target the same kind of homeowners. Those with weaker credit backgrounds who are homeowners primarily by virtue of the subprime lending spree will require not only refinancing but also a significant principal reduction, which is why we have also called for bankruptcy judges to be allowed to reduce the mortgage principal on a primary residence (see our “Fairness in Bankruptcy Act”).
 
Our proposal for a modern-day Home Owners’ Loan Corporation would closely resemble the “Home Owners’ Loan Corporation for the 21st Century Act,” introduced as H.R. 5649 in the 110th Congress. It is important to note that, while it is more common to hear progressive voices calling for the creation of a modern-day HOLC, it was Republican Congressman Mark Kirk of Illinois that sponsored H.R. 5649 back in 2008.10

"The Great Recession had a formidable impact on everyone in the US economy, intensifying the trends of increasing vulnerability that developed over the past 30 years.  But young people fared especially poorly.  In reality, the new generation of workers was already falling behind.  New obstacles to economic opportunity that emerged throughout the past three decades were reinforced in the aftermath of the crisis.  As a result, for young people today it is harder to either work or educate one’s way into the middle class.
Demos and Young Invincibles partnered to complete the State of Young America report, the first comprehensive look at the economic challenges facing young adults since the Great Recession. 
Young people have the highest rates of unemployment and are earning less than the previous generation in the jobs they do hold.  In order to ensure this generation and future generations can enter the middle class, America must create jobs and also increase job quality so that more jobs are good, middle-class positions—or, at minimum, offer a means to climb into the middle class.  Suggestions for achieving this goal include:
Young Invincibles is proud to announce the next step in our work to expand opportunity for all young Americans between 18 and 34. Along with dozens of our national and local partners we will soon launch the “Campaign for Young America” to help turn the youth energy and frustration around a lack of economic opportunity into concrete steps for change. The Campaign will engage and mobilize young adults across the country to share their voices on how to expand opportunity for our generation, putting the ideas and activism of young adults front and center in the local, state and national conversation.  We believe it is our generation’s responsibility to not only describe the problems, but to use all our skills, insights, passion and hard work to create the way forward. We will work with hundreds of thousands of young adults to develop concrete solutions and a mechanism to get involved, be heard, and make a difference at the federal, state and local level.
In early Spring 2012, we will launch the “What’s Your Solution” online application, letting thousands of young people share their economic solutions and commit to take action. We will following by hosting the National Youth Bus Tour across the country, with dozens of youth roundtable discussions, events on campuses and off, and direct action bringing the voices of young adults to our political leaders. In June, we will present the culmination and synthesis of the youth roundtables, a coherent, specific agenda on federal policy—the Young American Dream Agenda—that will describe the changes hundreds of thousands of our generation demand. With youth partners around the country, we will bring the Agenda directly to our state and national political leaders, to demand that they do their part in making that Dream a reality.",policy-briefs
"Answers to 8 frequently asked questions.
Credit reports and scores have a direct and growing impact on Americans' economic security and opportunity. They are increasingly being used by insurance companies, employers, utilities and even hospitals for a range of economic decisions despite. Yet the credit reporting system falls short on basic goals of fairness, accuracy, and transparency. Moreover, high unemployment, the foreclosure crisis, and other factors associated with the recession have combined to reduce Americans' credit standing just as credit information is becoming more widely used.  Through their credit reports and scores, individuals and families will continue to pay for a crisis they didn't cause well into the future.
Credit records regularly exclude relevant information, include inaccurate information, and contain data about medical debt collections that reveals more about an individual's private health concerns than their overall credit worthiness. Recent research suggests that more than 20 million Americans could find material errors on their credit reports. 
Credit reports largely mirror racial and economic divides, with African Americans and Latinos as well as low-income people, disproportionately likely to have lower scores. In turn, these communities are more likely to be offered high-priced loan products, which may contribute to more defaults, maintaining and amplifying historical injustice and diminishing access to the American Dream.
Credit reports are composed exclusively of information about individual consumers, but consumers lack unrestricted access to relevant credit information and must often pay fees to obtain their own credit scores.
Credit reports and scores are products compiled by three large for-profit corporations - Equifax, Experian and TransUnion - in addition to a growing number of smaller companies reporting specialized credit information. Credit scores are distinct products, although they are often sold with reports. A credit score is a single number that is supposed to represent the likelihood that a borrower will make payments to a lender as agreed. There is no single methodology for producing credit scores. Credit reports are composed exclusively of information about individual consumers and typically include one's Social Security Number and employment history, information on each credit account the individual has established, and a list of everyone who has accessed the individual's report within the last 24 months. It will also include information on bankruptcies, foreclosures, liens and similar public record information. 
Home and car insurers charge more to individuals with low credit scores, claiming that people with poor credit are more likely to make an insurance claim. However, this propensity might reflect unfair factors such as race or income: Consumers with poor credit may simply have fewer financial resources and be more likely to file a claim rather than ""eating"" the loss. ((How are employers using credit records? Six out of ten employers now use credit reports to evaluate job candidates, despite a lack of evidence that credit history correlates to job performance or likelihood to commit fraud. Credit reports and scores are experiencing ""mission creep""-increasingly being used by insurance companies, employers, utilities and hospitals for a variety of economic decisions. Job seekers risk being caught in a Catch-22: Tthey can't pay their bills without a job, but can't get a job without because they have unpaid bills. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission warns that using credit reports in hiring and firing may produce racially discriminatory decisions that violate federal civil rights laws.
The new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is empowered to enforce the Fair Credit Reporting Act, write regulations, and supervise the large for-profit credit reporting bureaus. The CFPB should take steps to reduce the amount of erroneous information in credit reports and increase the transparency of credit reporting and scoring, while also mandating the elimination of information, like medical debt records, that has little relevance to future likelihood to repay debt.
Five states have acted to restrict the use of credit checks in hiring, and 20 more are considering legislation. The Equal Employment for All Act, pending in the U.S. Congress, would limit the employment use of credit checks nationally. State and federal legislation is also being considered to regulate other non-employment uses of credit information.

"This bill unravels important consumer safeguards that protect American consumers and leaves communities of color particularly vulnerable.
Dear Representative,
Demos urges you to oppose S. 2155, the “Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act,” as it appears before the U.S. House of Representatives. This bill unravels important consumer safeguards that protect American consumers and leaves communities of color particularly vulnerable. At the same time, the bill makes our financial system more unstable, susceptible to shocks that could once again take down the global economy.
S. 2155 is not needed to promote economic growth: Since the passage of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank), lending has rebounded, unemployment has declined and the stock market is setting record highs. The financial sector does not need further deregulation. Instead, Congress must ensure the economic recovery is more broadly shared and that ordinary working Americans are not left out of the economic expansion now benefitting the financial sector. Deregulation with not secure these aims.
This legislation is not needed to protect the health of community banks, which are flourishing. In the third quarter of 2017, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation reported that 96 percent of the nation’s 5,294 community banks were profitable1, up from just 70 percent in depths of the financial crisis in 2009.2
The declining number of small banks is the result of a long-term trend predating Dodd-Frank by 20 years.  When a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond3 examined the health of small banks after the financial crisis, it concluded that the weak economy caused by the financial crisis accounted for small bank failures or consolidation, not new regulations contained in the Dodd-Frank Act.4
S. 2155 makes our financial system more unstable. Section 203 eliminates all Volcker Rule restrictions on proprietary trading for banks with less than $10 billion in assets. Dodd-Frank’s 
Volcker Rule establishes the principle that banks that receive taxpayer-backed deposits insured through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. should not use these funds for short-term speculation. High risk gambling with taxpayer backed money contributed to the financial crisis of 2008. Current law already allows regulators to tailor regulations to reduce compliance burdens for smaller banks.
Section 401 poses another problem. It undermines Dodd-Frank by deregulating large institutions posing as community banks. “Stadium Banks” or banks that qualify under this section are so large that sports stadiums are named after them. Eighteen stadiums around the world are named after at least one of the banks exempted from oversight from this bill.5
Currently, any bank with over $50 billion in total consolidated assets is subject to common sense prudential standards, including extra capital and liquidity requirements, stress tests and increased risk management.6 This bill raises this oversight threshold to $100 billion immediately and to $250 billion within 18 months, leaving many large banks without the oversight needed to protect the economy in the event of bank failure.7
Section 401 would relieve 25 of the 38 largest U.S. banks from oversight that safeguard our economy. Major financial institutions will be permitted to make risky financial bets, relying on the public to bail them out.
Even more troubling, this bill guts a crucial civil rights and consumer protection law. Section 104 exempts close to 85 percent of all banks and credit unions from a law expanding on and improving the data collected by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975 (HMDA). Banks and credit unions are to report information they are already collecting in their day-to-day underwriting process. This information includes specific details on loans such as the total points and fees, the difference between the annual percentage rate paid compared to the benchmark rate for all loans, any prepayment penalty terms, the value of a property, the borrower’s credit score and whether a loan was a “reverse mortgage” sold to a senior.
The recent expansion of reporting requirements helps policymakers better identify when underserved communities are being unfairly denied loans or overcharged. It allows law 
enforcement to efficiently target mortgage lenders that prey upon low-income communities and communities of color.
Section 104 effectively strips an essential civil rights provision, which is needed to combat ongoing discriminatory practices. A recent Center for Investigative Reporting study showed that African-Americans still find it far more difficult to get affordable home loans than white households, even if they have greater income and wealth.8 Loans for communities of color consistently come with higher interest rates and fees.
We need to improve ways to fight discrimination, not curtail them. State attorneys general, fair housing advocates, and citizens should be able to get the tools required by law to connect racial, ethnic, gender and age discrimination to mortgages made in communities across America.
S. 2155 is an attack on all consumers, including low-income communities and communities of color. It puts our financial system at risk. We cannot tolerate the further weakening of consumer protections, any undermining of the independence of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and financial deregulation that could lead to another financial crisis.
We urge you to oppose this bill as it appears before the U.S. House of Representatives.

"Dear Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray,
Demos, a national non-partisan public policy organization working for an America where we all have an equal say in our democracy and an equal chance in our economy, writes to express serious concerns regarding the nomination of Betsy DeVos to be the next U.S. Secretary of Education.
We are concerned that given Ms. DeVos’ track record to privatize public education and her lack of a clear position concerning the affordability crisis in higher education, the committee cannot properly assess whether Ms. DeVos is fit to run the U.S. Department of Education.
Among its priorities, the U.S. Department of Education plays a critical role in ensuring our public institutions for higher learning are accessible and affordable for all, regardless of race, gender, or class. It also is directly responsible for the programs that provide financing necessary to attend college, and the contractors charged with servicing over $1 trillion in federal student loans. We are concerned that given Ms. DeVos’ track record to privatize public education and her lack of a clear position concerning the affordability crisis in higher education, the committee cannot properly assess whether Ms. DeVos is fit to run the U.S. Department of Education. We ask that you clarify her positions on this important topic prior to moving forward with the scheduled confirmation hearing, and ask for specific proposals on how the Department of Education should work to reduce the burden of student loan debt, and ensure that students face fewer financial barriers in attending and completing college.
As you are aware, too many students do not attend college, or complete a degree program, precisely due to the high cost and need to borrow. As late as the 1990s, most students did not borrow to attend college. Now college costs and student debt are both soaring. Driven by a retreat of states from their traditional commitment to funding public colleges and universities, tuition and borrowing have soared over the past several decades. With financial aid not keeping pace, our most vulnerable communities, including veterans, undocumented students, student-parents, and students of color, have thrown themselves into once-unimaginable debt to attend college. In an era of stagnant incomes for all but the most well-off households, low-income students borrow at higher rates, and must borrow more for the same degree as their wealthier counterparts, even at public colleges and universities.1 Many families of color have been shut off from a vital avenue to the “American Dream.”
Betsy DeVos’ home state of Michigan provides an instructive example of these destructive trends. Just a generation ago, in 1990, tuition made up less than 40% of revenue at public colleges and universities in Michigan. Today, it makes up nearly 70%, far higher than the national average, according to the State Higher Education Executive Officers Association.2 Per-student funding, adjusted for inflation, has dropped by over $2,000 per student. In other words, what used to be paid for by the public is now funded by individuals and families. Meanwhile, median household income in Michigan has declined over the past 25 years, leaving families less able to pay for rising college prices.
Rather than use her family’s considerable financial and political clout to shed light on this crisis in her home state, Ms. DeVos’ silence on college affordability and attainment, and her lack of commitment to public education at all levels, leaves us with deep reservations. This lack of focus and public record is striking, considering public colleges and universities educate three-in-four American college students. Rather than champion successful, transformative programs that guarantee affordable college – including the Kalamazoo Promise in her home state, to name one example – Ms. DeVos has instead funded and advocated for private, often for-profit, entities with little track record of improving student aspirations or student outcomes.
In an era when college aspirations have never been higher, we believe that it is more, not less, important to keep a watchful regulatory eye on for-profit actors – whether institutions of higher education, lenders, or other providers – who have continuously exploited the ambitions of low-income students, veterans, and students of color while often providing questionable value at very high cost. We believe that the next Secretary should commit to enforcing the Obama Administration’s Gainful Employment regulations, as well as committing that each student defrauded by a for-profit college or university – including all Corinthian and ITT Tech campuses – will be made whole and have their debt obligations completely forgiven.
In short, we believe that Ms. DeVos should commit to ensuring that defrauded students receive all of the relief to which they are entitled, and that the federal government should not continue to subsidize career education programs that leave students with unpayable debt and no value in the job market. To our knowledge, Ms. DeVos has not stated a position on these rules and the values underlying them. And with the absence of a record or even statement committing to the support of students at public college or universities, we urge the committee to seek detailed responses before proceeding with a hearing or considering her nomination.
The next U.S. Secretary of Education plays a key role in boosting access to higher education in the United States, and has the opportunity to expand protections to students who have done nothing more than attempt to achieve their personal dreams and career ambitions. As college prices continue to squeeze families and student debt continues to hang over a generation of college-goers, we need a Secretary that both comprehends the gravity of the affordability crisis and welcomes solutions that invest and protects the interest of working- and middle-class students, and ensures that they have well-funded, affordable public institutions at which they can achieve their dreams. We ask that you do not proceed with the confirmation hearing until a closer examination of Ms. DeVos is conducted to assess these matters.

"We want to applaud the members of the Judiciary Committee for holding a hearing tomorrow on deceptive practices and urge the members of the Committee to support the passage of the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act of 2011 (S.453).
The ability to cast a ballot free from interference protects the other essential freedoms that Americans hold dear.
The ability to cast a ballot free from interference protects the other essential freedoms that Americans hold dear. Unfortunately, recent elections have seen a proliferation of “deceptive practices” leading up to the vote. In Maryland in 2011, for instance, robocalls with erroneous information were made to more than 50,000 potential voters on Election Day. In 2006, also in Maryland, a number of paid campaign workers distributed inaccurate voter guides and sample ballots that misidentified candidates as an opposing party’s preferred choices.
Often these deceptive practices include threats of legal retaliation against individuals who show up to vote. During the 2004 election season, fliers were circulated in black neighborhoods of Milwaukee from the nonexistent ""Milwaukee Black Voters League"" falsely informing voters that if they had voted in other elections that year, they were ineligible to vote in the Presidential election. These fliers stated, ""If you've already voted in any election this year, you can't vote in the presidential election. . . If you violate any of these laws, you can get ten years in prison and your children will get taken away from you.""
Similar deceptive practices are frequently targeted at students. In 2004, a county district attorney in Texas, attempting to impose unlawful requirements for proof of address, wrote a letter to the local election administrator stating that students at the Prairie View A&M University were ineligible to vote in the county and did not enjoy the same presumption of residency for voting purposes as other county residents. The district attorney’s letter, which was subsequently published in a local paper, threatened to prosecute students who cast a ballot without meeting these unlawful requirements. And in 2008, flyers were posted around the Drexel University campus in Philadelphia warning that undercover officers would be at polling locations to arrest students with outstanding warrants or traffic violations.
The above is only a short sampling of the types of violations that are taking place.  These practices suppress voter turnout, discourage civic participation, and do long-term damage to our democracy. The Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act of 2011 would protect the right to vote, the indisputable cornerstone of our democracy, without interfering with rights granted under the First Amendment. Congress should act quickly to pass this needed legislation.

"Federal contractors perform many of the vital functions that keep our public services running— they clean and maintain many of our public buildings, make uniforms for our soldiers, and manufacture many of the goods used by our government, among other functions. Yet as we found in our earlier study, “Underwriting Bad Jobs: How Our Tax Dollars Are Funding Low-Wage Work and Fueling Inequality,” our federal government is awarding contracts to companies that fail to pay nearly 560,000 people enough to meet basic needs.1 As Congress and the President consider how to address the troubling rise of low-paid work across our economy, increased attention is being paid to the poor working standards of companies that our government itself does business with, which have ignited multiple strikes by workers employed by concessionaires in federal buildings. Calls for a raise are often met with the objection that employers cannot afford the higher labor costs and will pass them on to customers—in this case, taxpayers.
A recent Government Accountability Office (GAO) study2 offers new figures revealing how much taxpayers are already paying for contractor labor costs—except that we are bankrolling the paychecks of already-wealthy executives instead of supporting more livable wages for American workers struggling to get by. As the country faces record inequality and a CEO to average worker gap that has grown to 273-to-1,3 current law dictates that taxpayers subsidize more than $760,000 per year toward the compensation of contracting executives who often earn millions of dollars annually. This is $360,000 more than we pay the President and nearly $530,000 more than we pay the Vice President.
In this brief, we extrapolate from the GAO study to estimate that the federal government is spending an estimated $20.8 to $23.9 billion a year to pay private contractors for the compensation of top executives. $6.97 to $7.65 billion in taxpayer dollars is spent annually on pay that exceeds the U.S. Vice President’s salary of $230,700 a year. Yet this gross misuse of taxpayer dollars is not inevitable. If the government cut the billions of dollars in excessive subsidies it pays for the salaries of executives at contracting companies, those savings could pay the lowest-paid contract workers a more livable wage, all without additional cost to taxpayers. Public officials should also evaluate cases where work can be done more efficiently and effectively by government employees than private contractors. 
The federal government spends an estimated $23.9 billion a year paying private contractors for the compensation of top executives. If taxpayer-funded payouts for these executives were capped at $230,700—the salary of the U.S. Vice President—the pay of hundreds of thousands of low-wage federal contract workers could be raised by as much as $6.69 per hour or $13,902 per year for a full-time worker, without costing taxpayers an additional dime. 
This brief uses the results of a recent Government Accountability Office (GAO) study on contracting compensation4 to estimate the amount the government could save if it lowered the cap on the maximum amount of employee compensation that contractors can charge to the federal government. Current law dictates that the federal government must reimburse or price into contracts up to $763,039 in compensation for any one employee—an amount pegged to the salaries of the most highly-paid private sector executives. This maximum, which has risen by 48 percent (adjusted for inflation) since 2004,5 is set to rise to more than $950,000 later this year if no action is taken to change the formula.6
Here we consider the savings if the cap were lowered to the amount of the U.S. Vice President’s salary, $230,700 per year, which matches the proposal in the bipartisan Commonsense Contractor Compensation Act of 2013. This amount also represents the maximum that most civilian employees directly employed by the federal government can make in a given year. Firms with federal contracts could continue to pay their executives amounts far exceeding this cap, but taxpayers would no longer reimburse or price these costs into contracts with the affected companies for any amount in excess of $230,700. We estimate that by lowering the cap for all contracting firms to $230,700 annually, the government would save $6.97 to $7.65 billion per year.
To address the problem of poverty-wage jobs on federal contracts, we then calculate the raise that could be given to lower-paid contract employees with these savings. We find that if the savings from a lower public recognition of executive pay were hypothetically used to give a raise to low-paid contract employees—the 560,000 contractors who earn $12 per hour or less—it could pay for a raise of $13,902 per year, or $6.68 per hour assuming a full-time workload. If we instead used the savings to give raises to all 2.15 million contractors who earn less than $230,700, we could give them each a raise of $3,624 per year, or $1.74 per hour. Cutting the taxpayer subsidy of millionaires’ salaries while raising the wages of ordinary workers would not only be efficient, but would set an example of fairer compensation.
To estimate the savings that would result from a lower cap on contractor compensation, the GAO surveyed the compensation practices of a stratified, random sample of 30 defense contractors who reflect the contracting universe: two “very large” contractors (contracting obligations over $25 billion), eight large contractors (obligations between $2 billion and $25 billion), ten medium contractors (obligations between $15 million and $2 billion) and ten small contractors (obligations less than $15 million). The GAO asked each of the contractors to provide salary information on the employees who earned more than the vice president’s salary ($230,700, the proposed level of a new lower cap) as well as the number of employees earning over that cap. Twenty-seven of the thirty contractors provided the full range of data requested by the GAO, but the three largest contractors surveyed—The Boeing Company, Lockheed Martin Corporation, and northrop Grumman Corporation—refused to provide either the number of employees earning over the proposed cap, or their salaries. The 27 contractors that replied to the survey received a total of 7 percent of all federal defense contracts in 2012, or $25.2 billion, as shown in Figure 1. They reported 3,444 total employees that received compensation from contracts in 2012 greater than the lower proposed cap.
Based on the compensation information provided, the GAO estimated that reducing the cap on compensation recognized by the public to $230,700 would save the federal government a total of $440 million at the 27 surveyed contractors. We use these numbers to estimate the average amount of compensation currently paid by federal contracts under the existing cap. Dividing the $440 million in estimated savings by the reported 3,444 highly-compensated employees at these firms yields an average savings of $127,758 per highly-compensated employee. By adding this figure to the new proposed cap of $230,700, we arrive at an estimate of an average $358,458 per employee that is being paid under the current cap; this estimate is included in Figure 1 as well.
We then use these calculations to produce a total savings estimate from a lower cap, first for all defense contracts and then for all federal contracts. even though the GAO cautions that this study should not be extrapolated to the entire contracting universe, we argue that, despite the refusal of the three largest surveyed contractors to respond to the survey, their sample is in fact representative for three reasons:
First, both the contracting universe and the GAO’s sample are dominated by large contractors: there were 40 contractors who received $2 billion or more in contracts in 2012, and they accounted for more than 41 percent of total contracting dollars.
Second, the 27 contractors who did respond to the survey account for 7 percent of all defense contracts (and 5 percent of all contracts); thus, they alone represent a significant portion of the contracting universe.
Third, considering that the three contractors who refused to respond to the survey were three of the largest contractors provides evidence that the GAO’s estimate may be a conservative one, when extrapolated to the larger contracting universe. It is highly likely that the reason these large companies refused to provide information is because they have a very large number of highly-paid employees—in fact, the GAO finds that in general larger contractors in their sample had 71 percent higher share of employees earning more than $230,700 than mid-sized contractors. If these three largest contractors had responded, the GAO’s estimate would have likely been even higher.
Given this reasoning, we assume that compensation practices among all defense contractors are commensurate with the average among the surveyed contractors. Thus, because the surveyed contractors received 7 percent of all defense contracts, we calculate that there were 49,200 total defense-contracting employees in 2012 that were compensated above the level of the proposed cap. Using our calculation of the new cap’s average savings of $127,758 per employee, we estimate that the total savings from the proposed lower cap for all defense contractors would be $6.29 billion; both estimates are shown in Figure 1.
Finally, we extend this reasoning to non-defense (civilian) contracts to produce our savings estimate for all federal contracts. The challenge is that there is little information about the costs of compensation for highly-paid employees at civilian contractors. Therefore, we make a series of conservative assumptions: first, we assume that the proportion of civilian contract employees who make more than the proposed cap ranges from the same number as defense contractors (21,299 employees) to just half as many (10,650 employees). We also assume that these highly-paid employees of civilian contractors earn just half as much over the proposed cap as their defense counterparts do. This produces an estimated taxpayer savings from a lower cap of $680 million to $1.36 billion for non-defense contractors. Adding this to the $6.29 billion in estimated savings from defense contractors from a lower cap yields $6.97—$7.65 billion in total savings from the lower cap for all federal contractors; these estimates are shown in Figure 1 as well.
Would a lower pay cap negatively affect contracting firms’ ability to recruit and retain executives seeking higher salaries? not necessarily: contractors could and most likely would continue to pay top employees at any rate they deem to be competitive—taxpayers would simply not be subsidizing so much of the bill. 

Instead of spending $7 billion or more per year of our tax dollars to subsidize the salaries of high-paid contracting employees, many of whom are multi-millionaires, we could instead use the savings from a lower cap to give a large raise to the hundreds of thousands of contract employees who are struggling to make ends meet. As shown in Figure 2, if we used this savings to increase the wages of the nearly 560,000 contractors currently earning $12 per hour or less, it could pay for a raise of $13,902 per year for each of these contractors. If this were spread over a standard full-time work year of 2,080 hours, it would translate to a raise of $6.68 per hour. If instead the savings were redirected to give a raise to all of the more than 2.1 million estimated contractors who earn less than the proposed lower cap, it could pay for a raise of $3,624 per year or, using the same standard work year, $1.74 per hour. 

Lower the Cap on Contractor Compensation—Congress should pass the Commonsense Contractor Compensation Act of 2013, a bipartisan bill sponsored by Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV), Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Congressman Paul Tonko (D-NY) that would cap the maximum amount taxpayers reimburse or price into all defense and civilian government contractors for their salaries at the same amount as the Vice President’s salary, currently $230,700. To the maximum extent possible, President Obama should also direct contracting officers to limit pay for contractors to the level of the Vice President’s salary.
Raise Standards for Low-wage Contract Employees—President Obama should issue an executive order requiring federal agencies to take all possible steps to raise workplace standards for federal contractors. For example, the government could use fair wages and benefits as an evaluation factor in selecting federal contractors. This would follow the precedent of Lyndon Johnson’s Executive Order 11246, mandating equal employment opportunity and affirmative action for all individuals working for federal contractors.
Stop Doing Business with Irresponsible Contractors—At minimum, the executive branch must act to ensure that the United States does not sign contracts with companies that regularly violate wage and hour laws, workplace health and safety regulations, or other employment protections.
Include Concession Workers in the Service Contract Act— Due to an accident of history, employees of federal concessionaires, such as the food service workers at restaurants in the Smithsonian who went on strike recently, are not covered by the Service Contract Act that provides a wage floor for federal contract employees. The Department of Labor should act to include these workers. 
Consider In-Sourcing—Federal agencies should evaluate when work can be done more efficiently and effectively by government employees than private companies. As agencies like U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Internal Revenue Service have already found, bringing previously contracted services back into the public domain can save money, providing a better value for taxpayers.7
Our earlier study, “Underwriting Bad Jobs” found that nearly two million private sector employees working on behalf of America earn wages too low to support a family, making $12 or less per hour. Approximately 560,000 of these workers are employed by federal contractors. now we find that an estimated $6.97 to $7.65 billion a year in taxpayer funds is spent to offer highly-paid contracting executives hundreds of thousands of dollars more than the most highly-compensated public officials are paid.
Many political leaders have suggested setting a more reasonable cap on the amount U.S. taxpayers pay to highly paid contractors. The United States Senate recently passed legislation that would cap compensation at companies under contract with the Department of Homeland Security and the national Guard at the Vice President’s salary.8 President Obama has also submitted a proposal to Congress to lower the cap. Yet the contractor lobby has so far held back efforts to limit the extent to which taxpayers bankroll their pay.
We propose not only a lower cap for highly-paid contractors but also a raise that would better enable the lowest-paid contract employees to support their families. As this analysis illustrates, it would be possible to pay the lowest wage contract workers fairly without costing taxpayers a dime. What’s more, better pay could be achieved without action on the part of Congress. President Obama has repeatedly cited the country’s growing inequality as one of the greatest threats to both our social fabric and our country’s growth. In his landmark economic address on July 24, the President vowed that “whatever executive authority I have to help the middle class, I’ll use it.”9 One of the most powerful steps the President could take would be to require that contractors raise the wages of their low-paid employees. ",policy-briefs
"The retail industry is one the largest sources of new jobs in the US economy, employing 15 million Americans and accounting for 1 out of every 6 private sector jobs added to the economy last year. Yet as my colleague Catherine Ruetschlin and NAACP’s Dedrick Asante-Muhammad found in a study published earlier this month, common retail practices perpetuate racial inequality, fostering occupational segregation, low pay, unstable schedules, and involuntary part-time work that disproportionately harm people of color in the retail workforce.
This week a new report casts a spotlight on employment discrimination at a particular retailer: Zara, a fairly new clothing chain in the United States which nevertheless is part of the world’s largest fashion retail company. Based on interviews of 251 Zara employees in New York City, researchers at the Center for Popular Democracy uncovered troubling pattern of concerns about racial discrimination. They find that Black employees are far more likely than other workers to be assigned work hours they find unsatisfactory and that darker skinned employees report they are least likely to be promoted. The report documents a widespread perception of managerial favoritism, with employees of color being treated more harshly and offered less leeway when requesting a sick day or coming in to work late. Darker skinned workers are disproportionately employed in lower-prestige positions in the back of the store. The company rejects the findings, asserting that it does “not tolerate discrimination of any form.”
Yet accusations of racism on the sales floor are a counterpoint to a recent lawsuit alleging discrimination within Zara’s corporate structure, including claims that senior executives at Zara regularly used racial slurs and exchanged racist emails while discriminating against a corporate attorney who was Jewish and gay. The company has also faced scrutiny for selling racially and ethnically offensive clothing and accessories.
According the new report, Zara employees have also witnessed racial profiling of customers, with Black shoppers far more likely to be targeted as potential thieves than white customers. Here too, the allegations fit into a deplorable pattern within the retail industry: last year, major New York retailers Macy’s and Barney’s entered into settlements with the office of New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to settle allegations of racial profiling and false detentions and agreeing to take concrete steps to prevent discrimination against shoppers of color.
But while lawsuits and enforcement actions can make a difference, Zara and other retailers must not wait for legal action to remedy conditions that disadvantage workers and shoppers of color. The NAACP/Demos report highlights how offering livable wages and improving employee schedules would reduce racial disparities even as low-paid employees of all races and ethnicities see benefits. And the Center for Popular Democracy report suggests that Zara allow its New York workers “to choose to represent themselves in grievances through real bargaining agents, such as labor unions, without interference.” By directly empowering employees to push for fair treatment, a union could make the most enduring change of all.",blog
"Medical debt is different. Typically when consumers borrow money, they can consider how much they’ll owe, shop around for the best interest rate, and usually have at least a little breathing room to reassess whether the goods or services they want to purchase are worth going into debt for in the first place. All that goes out the window, however, if your child is rushed to the emergency room in need of life-saving treatment.
As Consumer Financial Protection Bureau director Richard Corday explained in May:
When people fall ill and end up at the hospital with unexpected bills, they may not have the money to pay for the doctors, procedures, and medicine. Sometimes insurance does not cover everything. Sometimes they do not know what they owe because of how complicated the billing process can be. Other times they may not even know they owe anything, thinking that their insurance will cover the bill. Sometimes the debt is caused by billing issues with medical providers or insurers. Complaints to the Bureau indicate that many consumers do not even know they have a medical debt in collections until they get a call from a debt collector or they discover the debt on their credit report.
As a result, the fact that someone has difficulty paying their medical bills may not be an accurate reflection of their credit worthiness when it comes to paying other types of debts.
The Federal Reserve raised this concern a decade ago. But it took the CFPB to substantiate the misgivings about medical debt and quantify the problem. In a recent study, the agency analyzed five million anonymous credit records, looking at how well a common credit score predicted a consumer’s future likelihood of paying back debt. They found that credit scoring models tend to penalize consumers too heavily for medical debt, underestimating the creditworthiness by ten points for consumers who owe medical debt and by up to 22 for consumers who have medical debt that went into collections before being paid off. As a result, consumers with medical debt—even debts that are paid off—may be turned down for loans, or have to pay higher interest rates when they do get credit.
This is no niche issue: medical debt is exceedingly common. According to credit bureau Experian, 64.3 million Americans—more than a quarter of all 220 million U.S. residents for whom a credit history exists—had at least one medical collection on their credit report as of July 2014.
The good news? Good research can change the world. The Fair Isaac Corporation, developers and marketers of the frequently used FICO credit scoring system, announced last week that they would change their scoring model to give less weight to medical bills and would exclude bills on collections that had been fully paid-off. Over time, millions of American consumers will pay less on new mortgages, student loans, credit card bills, and car loans—with the lower rates better reflecting their actual creditworthiness. While I have seen no acknowledgement from FICO that they were influenced by the CFPB’s study, it’s difficult to believe the timing is entirely coincidental.
By raising awareness about the shortcomings of letting medical debt drag down credit scores and providing the data to show that the impact, the CFPB again acted to make the financial marketplace a bit more fair to consumers.",blog
"Soaring rhetoric about freedom and choice is everywhere on Capitol Hill this week.
From the chamber of the House Financial Services Committee, we hear that consumers are losing “economic opportunity and freedom” because they don’t have enough access to risky, high-cost credit. The Financial CHOICE Act, subject of a hearing this Wednesday, would restore lost liberty by gutting consumer safeguards. Meanwhile, the House Education and Workforce Committee frets that workers miss out on “freedom, choice, and fairness” because they lack the opportunity to trade away overtime pay for the chance to ask the boss for time off. Under the Working Families Flexibility Act, also due to be marked up this week, employees would be liberated from decades of pesky worker protections.
Of course, many Americans would appreciate more flexibility at work and more choices when we need a loan. Unfortunately, while these bills are wrapped in rhetoric about freedom for ordinary consumers and workers, the legislation being considered would actually place greater power into the hands of banks and employers. All the choices are for Wall Street, and all the flexibility is for corporate bosses.
Consider the Financial CHOICE Act, sponsored by House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling (TX). The legislation rolls back key provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which was enacted after the 2008 financial crisis to rein in the reckless banks that brought down the economy. In particular, the bill eviscerates the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), an agency devoted to battling financial scams and rip-offs and making sure banks and other financial companies treat consumers fairly.
Since it was established in 2011 the CFPB has returned $11.8 billion to nearly 30 million Americans who were cheated by financial companies. As I’ve noted before, unscrupulous financial corporations could make a whole lot more money if the CFPB didn’t stand in their way. By eliminating the CFPB’s independent funding, weakening the position of the agency’s director, and eliminating whole swaths of authority to supervise financial institutions and challenge unfair and deceptive financial practices, the Financial CHOICE Act enacts the financial scammers’ wish list, rendering the CFPB a feeble shadow of its current self. At the bottom line, consumers would again be “free” to be ripped off by deceptively marketed financial products and cheated by loans that are designed to fail.
The Working Families’ Flexibility Act offers a similar bait and switch. From California to Connecticut and Minneapolis to Pittsburgh, states and cities across the nation are taking action to guarantee working people the right to paid leave. Laws to provide similar guarantees of paid sick time and time to care for a new child or ailing loved one are now pending in Congress – yet the Working Families Flexibility Act is not one of them.
Instead of guaranteeing access to paid leave when working people need it, the bill sponsored by Rep. Martha Roby (AL) and Senator Mike Lee (UT) simply gives more power to bosses. First, companies would have a new option to offer “comp time” instead of the overtime pay that many workers are now owed when they’re on the job more than 40 hours a week. If employers opt for comp time, workers who once earned overtime would be handed a sizable pay cut. Next, employers could decide when workers are permitted to use the comp time they’ve accrued, meaning pay could still be denied to a worker in bed with the flu even if he had comp time accrued. An expecting mother could be refused the right to use her accrued comp time for parental leave if her baby is inconveniently born at a time when the company would prefer to have everyone working. Under the Working Families Flexibility Act, employers would be granted more flexibility, but working Americans would only gain the “freedom” to work for less money and take time off when it’s convenient for the boss.
Dressing up a fundamentally anti-worker, anti-consumer agenda in the language of freedom, flexibility, and choice does nothing to change its true aim of increasing the power that Wall Street and corporate America have over ordinary citizens. It’s up to Americans to see through the disguise and oppose these noxious bills. ",blog
"We are in the midst of National Protect Your Identity Week, and credit reporting giant Experian is kicking off the festivities with some ID theft prevention tips, such as signing up for Experian’s own credit monitoring service at a cost of $14.95 a month. Never mind that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has advised consumers that paying for credit monitoring is unnecessary and lower-cost alternatives exist—preying on fear is good business for Experian. After all, there are so many identity thieves out there, and some of them acquired Americans’ valuable personal information from. . . Experian.
An article today by former Washington Post reporter Brian Krebs reveals that the same company cashing in on unnecessary credit monitoring products to catch ID theft also allowed an identity theft website, Superget.info, to buy private information from its databases. According to Krebs:
An identity theft service that sold Social Security and drivers license numbers — as well as bank account and credit card data on millions of Americans — purchased much of its data from Experian, one of the three major credit bureaus…  the proprietors of Superget.info had gained access to Experian’s databases by posing as a U.S.-based private investigator. In reality… the individuals apparently responsible for running Superget.info were based in Vietnam.
There is no evidence that Experian deliberately peddled customers’ personal data to criminals. Yet Marc Martin, CEO of a company that partnered with the Experian subsidiary, suggested to Krebs that Experian had clear warning signs that their customer was not who he claimed to be. One sign? The supposed American private investigator paid Experian using wire transfers from Singapore. One might think that would raise a red flag or two with a company that bills itself as expert on data security. Yet Experian took no action until the U.S. Secret Service informed the company its data was being used by criminals.
The Fair Credit Reporting Act regulates who can acquire a consumer report from a credit reporting agency like Experian, but breaches like this one suggest penalties and protections may not be substantial enough to motivate companies to closely screen who buys their data. After all, it’s a sweet business, selling consumer data to identity thieves on one hand and a monitoring service to alert frightened consumers to identity theft on the other. And with the current Congress unlikely to give regulators even the most commonsense new tools to crack down on the industry, this may not be the last we hear of this type of lucrative and exploitative business operation.",blog
"In a blockbuster article  this week, Jodi Kantor of the New York Times spotlighted the work and life of Jannette Navarro, a 22-year-old Starbucks barista and single mother, whose erratic and unpredictable work schedule wreaked havoc on her efforts to seek childcare, pursue an education, and generally get by day-to-day. “Ms. Navarro’s fluctuating hours, combined with her limited resources, had… turned their lives into a chronic crisis over the clock” governing everything from how much sleep her 4-year-old son would get before she had show up for a shift and to hustle him to child care to what groceries she could afford to buy.
Navarro’s struggle is far from an isolated one. As I documented in a recent study Retail’s Choice: How Raising Wages and Improving Schedules for Women in the Retail Industry Would Benefit America, workers at many of the nation’s largest and most profitable employers struggle to get enough work hours (and sufficiently stable hours) to make ends meet, making fair scheduling as important as raising wages for millions of workers. The burden of unstable schedules falls disproportionately on women—particularly mothers like Jannette Navarro—both because they are disproportionately likely to work in low-paid, part-time jobs and because they disproportionately bear responsibilities for child care and elder care.
In response to the Times’ scrutiny, Starbucks vowed to improve its scheduling policies. It was a smart corporate move both from a public relations perspective and because, as I highlight in my report, improved scheduling can have substantial benefits for employers themselves. Drawing on the work of MIT business professor Zeynep Ton, as well as an in-depth multi-year study by researchers at the University of Kentucky, I note that retailers’ efforts to precisely match labor supply to consumer traffic often fall short because just-in-time scheduling strategies fuel employee turnover, absenteeism and tardiness. In contrast, less erratic scheduling of hourly workers can benefit the bottom line of companies, for example promoting employee productivity, cultivating quality customer service, and reducing costs associated with turnover.
But Annie Lowrey points out in New York Magazine, steps taken by “enlightened” employers only go so far. The fundamental problem at Starbucks and beyond is workers’ fundamental lack of bargaining power.  “If Starbucks employees like Navarro could quit, or could refuse to work insane shifts on short notice, or could demand more accommodation of their needs, they would,” Lowrey points out. “They can’t. So they don’t.”
A tight economy with low unemployment gives workers more bargaining power. So, Lowrey points out, does joining a union, an uphill effort currently being pursued by some Starbucks employees through the Starbucks Workers Union.  Meanwhile, workers at Walmart -- another employer notorious for its low wages and unstable work schedules -- have banded together as a non-union organization, the Organization United for Respect at Walmart, and declared at least partial victory in their efforts to get greater access to work hours. At unionized stores, workers often have far more control over their work hours and a right to advance notice of schedules.
A third method of leaving the chaos of unstable schedules is legislative. The Retail Workers Bill of Rights, recently introduced in San Francisco, would guarantee workers at chain retail stores, restaurants and banks in the city the right to be offered more hours before an employer may hire additional part-time workers. The bill, promoted by Jobs with Justice and its coalition partners, would also equalize treatment of full- and part-time employees and mandate that workers be paid if they are required to be “on-call” for a shift. Another effort is being pursued nationally through the Fair Workweek Initiative led by the Center for Popular Democracy. They are promoting the Schedules that Work Act  a smart bill that could gain traction in a future, less business-dominated Congress.
Legislation, worker organizing, and employers open to making changes for their workforce are mutually reinforcing. It’s also critical to have good journalism that casts a light problems hidden from those fortunate enough to enjoy stable employment. Together, these efforts may begin to move the needle, improving scheduling and pay for workers like Jannette Navarro.",blog
"In an otherwise bleak landscape for progressive policy, the Fight for $15 has been one of a very few rays of light. Since the day in 2012 when 200 fast food workers in New York City walked out on strike, calling for $15 an hour and the right to join a union, cities and states across the country have raised their minimum wages, and several large private employers have increased pay for their low-wage workers. The National Employment Law Project estimated that as of last year, America’s lowest paid workers had won $62 billion in raises in conjunction with the Fight for $15’s demands.
Seattle is among the leaders in hiking its minimum wage, raising wages in a series of steps based on how many people a business employs, whether workers receive tips, and whether the employer contributes to workers’ health coverage. By the end of 2016, large Seattle employers who did not pay for insurance were required to pay workers a minimum of $13 an hour.
In a careful analysis of food service jobs in Seattle during the period of wage increases, researchers at the University of California Berkeley found that the wage hike succeeded in raising incomes for low-paid workers without impacting the number of jobs. These findings are in line with the bulk of research on the effects of raising minimum wages.
Yet there are powerful interests with a stake in halting the Fight for 15 movement in its tracks and continuing to pay rock-bottom wages. They are trumpeting a different study released this week by researchers at the University of Washington. This research suffers from serious methodological flaws, yet purports to show, in the words of Fox News, that “Seattle's first-in-the-nation $15 per hour minimum wage law is hurting the workers it aimed to help.”
As analysts at Washington State’s Economic Opportunity Institute point out, “poor research leads to poor findings.” Among its deficiencies, the University of Washington study excludes workers at chain businesses (from Starbucks to Walgreens), leaving out 40 percent of the city’s workforce. As a result, a worker leaving a job at a small business to go work at a chain establishment would be counted in the University of Washington data as having lost employment. For a deeper dive into the serious shortcomings of the UW study, see the Economic Policy Institute’s detailed analysis.
The reality is that wages have stagnated over the past 4 decades for the vast majority of Americans, and inequality has skyrocketed. Raising the minimum wage is a proven and effective means to put more money in the pockets of working people and begin to close the gap. The Fight for 15’s other central demand—for employers to recognize workers’ right to join a union and bargain collectively—would lift up an even broader range of working Americans, but has been even harder to achieve politically.
It’s no surprise that the Fight for $15 has generated a substantial backlash, nor is it the first time that a poorly conducted study produced findings convenient to corporations and other low-wage employers. Seattle’s economy is booming. Thanks to the minimum wage hike, workers at the bottom of the labor market are able to share in a bit more of the gains.",blog
"America used to be a nation that made things. Walmart – the nation’s largest employer and one of our most profitable corporations – played a key role in why we no longer do. Of course, this isn’t the official message Walmart wants to promote as it breaks out the confetti to celebrate its 50th birthday this week. Instead, the retail giant has unveiled a peppy website celebrating the occasion and is hailing the opening of its 10,000th store. Time magazine has marked the event by cataloguing “Ten Ways Walmart Changed the World"" from altering the retail landscape to pioneering data-driven management.
But as we celebrate not just Walmart’s birthday but the nation’s this week, it’s worth pondering the mega-retailer’s impact on America specifically. We got “everday low prices” but also a nation of growing inequality in which fewer people could afford to a shop anywhere else. In fact, Walmart workers and other stakeholders have launched their own Walmart at 50 effort designed to make the case that “the America Walmart helped to create isn’t working for most of us.” Walmart’s contribution to the downgrading of retail jobs has been well-explored, yet fewer have considered the company’s impact on workers it never even directly employed – the Americans who once made the United States a manufacturing powerhouse.
That’s why today Demos released a list of our own: NOT Made in America: Top 10 Ways Walmart Destroys US Manufacturing Jobs. From promoting domestic sweatshops to buying millions of goods that weren’t made in the America to disincentivizing the innovation that made our nation prosper, we chronicle how Walmart has wielded its tremendous market power in ways that eliminate good-paying manufacturing jobs and lower labor standards throughout its entire supply chain.
With the great resources at its disposal, Walmart could afford to take the high road, supporting good manufacturing jobs in America by allowing for higher wages and more investment in its supply chain and paying its own employees—from retail “associates” to warehouse workers and cleaning contractors—a living wage. That would set the template for a new American economy, one in which Americans might once again make things and also find greater dignity and stability in selling them. From  Walmart on its 50th birthday to America’s on its 236th that would be a gift worthy of celebration.  ",blog
"The steps of New York’s City Hall were crowded this morning. New Yorkers shut out of a job by employment credit checks spoke out and told their stories, expressing hope that New York City would build on its recent success banning discrimination against the unemployed  in hiring to also put an end to credit discrimination. 
After all, according to new research by the New York Public Interest Group (NYPIRG) and the Neighborhood Economic Development Advocacy Project (NEDAP) it isn’t New York’s small mom-and-pop businesses that insist on peering into a job applicant’s personal accounts, but the national and multinational companies – employers like Target and Home Depot – that already deal with restrictions on the use of employment credit checks in states like California, Illinois, Vermont, and Maryland. In the words of Deyanira Del Rio, Associate Director at NEDAP, “the main purchasers of employment credit reports are large corporations and chain stores, not the thousands of local small businesses that make up the economic lifeblood of New York City neighborhoods.”
Following the rally outside, workers and their supporters trooped inside for a hearing of the Civil Rights Committee on the Stop Credit Discrimination in Employment Act sponsored by Councilmember Brad Lander. and a veto-proof majority of 34 co-sponsors.
As expected, the Deputy Counsel for Mayor Michael Bloomberg objected to the bill, arguing that it failed to take into account the many reasons why credit history may be appropriate for a job. Faced with penetrating questions from Councilmember Lander, the Deputy Counsel could not provide evidence validating the use of credit information for any job category.
Alongside other members of the NYC Coalition to Stop Credit Checks in Employment,  I had an opportunity to speak on the bill. I told Councilmembers about Demos’ recent research on employment credit checks:
As I noted in a New York Daily News op-ed this morning co-written with Councilmember Dan Garodnick,  a co-sponsor of the bill:
ReNika Moore, speaking for the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund,  pointed out that “If passed without exemptions or carve-outs, New York City workers would have the strongest, most effective protections in the country against credit discrimination.” Today’s hearing puts us on the road to doing it.

"Why President Obama’s Fair Pay and Safe Workplace Executive Order must be implemented under the new administration.
Donald Trump campaigned as the champion of working-class Americans facing a system of crony capitalism supported by the federal government. There is no better example than the corporations that cheat their employees out of pay and maintain dangerous work sites—yet still retain lucrative contracts with the federal government and even have their contracts renewed. This is why President Obama’s Fair Pay and Safe Workplace Executive Order must be implemented under the new administration. The order, which is currently facing a legal challenge from the contractor lobby, would crack down on federal contractors that persistently abuse working Americans.
This brief illustrates why it is vital to implement the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Executive Order: violations of core worker protection laws, from wage regulations to safety rules, are rampant among federal contractors. Drawing on data from the Department of Labor, Dēmos estimates that Americans working for federal contractors lose $1.6 to $2.5 billion each year from violations of minimum wage laws alone. Yet minimum wage violations represent the tip of the iceberg, as federal contractors have also been held in violation of numerous other wage and hour laws, as well as health, safety, and labor laws—even as they continue to be awarded new contracts. We find that approximately 40 percent of all federal contracting dollars in 2013 went to contractors with health, safety or wage violations on their record.
While no company should underpay its workers, maintain a hazardous work environment, or engage in illegal discrimination, federal contractors carrying out work on behalf of the American people deserve extra scrutiny. With 1 in 5 American workers employed by a company that receives federal contracts, efforts to improve standards for contract workers are far-reaching. By establishing a mechanism to encourage contractors to comply with workplace protections—and denying them contracts if they persistently refuse to follow the law—the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Executive Order is a critical tool to fight workplace violations.
 
 
In the midst of World War I, United States Secretary of War Newton Baker was concerned about federal contracting. “The government cannot permit its work to be done under sweatshop conditions,” he declared, establishing minimum workplace standards for workers sewing military uniforms.1 From Baker’s time to our own, public officials of both political parties have taken responsibility for the conditions of people working to produce goods and deliver services on behalf of all Americans.
Following a century of precedent, President Obama used a series of executive orders to raise pay, guarantee paid sick time, and otherwise raise workplace standards for employees of federal contractors, culminating with an effort to ensure that federal tax dollars would not go to companies that violate employment laws. The Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Executive Order set up a system to prevent companies that deliberately and repeatedly cheat or mistreat their employees from profiting off federal contracts on the taxpayer dime. Yet just as the regulations implementing the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Executive Order were set to go into effect in autumn 2016, they were temporarily halted in response to a lawsuit from contractor lobby groups. As a new president prepares to take office, widespread violations by federal contractors remain an urgent and unsolved problem. The next president must implement and enforce the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Executive Order to address these abuses.
Although most federal contractors obey the law, serious breaches of health, safety, and employment laws remain far too widespread. To track the prevalence of workplace abuses by U.S. government contractors, Dēmos merged public federal contracting records with violations data from the U.S. Department of Labor.2 We find that between 1999 and 2013, contractors were fined nearly $722 million for serious violations of health, safety, and employment laws, accounting for 12 percent of all such fines. Approximately 40 percent of all federal contracting dollars in 2013—a total of $175 billion— went to contractors with health, safety or wage violations on their record. These findings mirror those of a previous investigation by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), which discovered that among the 50 companies receiving the largest penalties for violations of wage and hour laws between 2005 and 2009, half were federal contractors.3 Federal contractors were also among the companies facing the largest penalties for health and safety violations. Yet the GAO concluded that none of these noncompliant companies had been debarred or suspended from federal contracts as a result of their workplace abuses. Research by the United States Senate’s Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee provides additional evidence of large-scale workplace abuses—including cases of racial discrimination in hiring and breaches of child labor laws in addition to multiple wage and safety violations—by companies that continue to be awarded government contracts.4
These represent only the cases where workplace violations were detected, investigated, and penalties were assessed. Research suggests that most workplace violations, whether committed by federal contractors or other employers, are never officially documented or punished. For example, a seminal 2009 study of employment violations in America’s largest cities found that two- thirds of workers employed in low-paying industries experienced some form of wage theft in the previous work week, including failures to pay the minimum wage or overtime compensation, being required to work “off the clock,” having tips stolen, denial of meal breaks, and illegal payroll deductions.5 Some workers were never paid at all for work they performed in the last year. But only 20 percent of workers who experienced workplace violations reported to researchers that they made a complaint to their employer, their supervisor, or a government agency.6 Most said that they feared losing their job or experiencing some other form of retaliation if they complained about illegal workplace conditions. Other workers expressed concern that a complaint would not make a difference.
Because so many violations go unreported, assessing the full scope of workplace abuses among federal contractors is a daunting task. But a meticulous Department of Labor study of one type of wage theft—failure to pay the minimum wage—offers a window into the scale of wage loss employees of federal contractors are experiencing. Drawing on data from the Department of Labor study, researchers at the Economic Policy Institute estimate that violations of minimum wage laws alone amount to between $8.6 billion and $13.8 billion in lost wages each year.7 Federal contractors employ an estimated 18.4 percent of the nation’s civilian workers; assuming they violate minimum wage laws at the same rate as employers nationwide, this would mean that contract employees lose $1.6 to $2.5 billion a year just to violations of minimum wage laws.8 The lost wages affect not only workers but their families and communities. With smaller paychecks, workers cannot buy as many goods and services, reducing the support they provide to local economies. At the same time, workers with lower wages pay fewer taxes, starving state and local governments of revenue. Workers cheated out of wages may be forced to turn to food stamps and other forms of public assistance to feed their families.
From the 674 food service workers at the U.S. Capitol who were cheated out of more than a million dollars in overtime pay and other wages by the private companies running congressional cafeterias, to the two Mississippi shipbuilding workers who were killed in a “horrific and preventable situation” when flammable materials exploded in an improperly ventilated workspace, workplace violations have concrete and sometimes devastating consequences in the lives of working people, their families, and communities.9 The Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Executive Order is a powerful tool for bringing contractors into compliance with worker protection laws and ensuring that those who flagrantly and repeatedly abuse their employees no longer receive federal contracts.
 
Over the last three years, low-paid workers employed by federal contractors repeatedly walked out on strike in the nation’s capital. The have called for the type of basic standards the federal government has long sought to guarantee: wages that enable them to support a family, decent benefits, and the end of widespread violations of our nation’s most basic worker protections. President Obama took decisive steps to address their concerns, culminating in the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Executive Order aiming to ensure that the nation’s contracting dollars go to companies that abide by the law. Yet with the executive order held up by legal challenges from the contractor lobby, widespread employment violations by federal contractors persist. Donald Trump ran for office promising to stand up for working Americans: he must recognize the public responsibility for the conditions of people who work every day on behalf of the American people and take action to see this order implemented.",policy-briefs
"""If we had more freight to haul, we'd be doing more hiring,"" trucking executive Barbara Windsor explained to President Obama earlier this year. From the small businesses suffering weak sales and a shortfall of customers to the large companies now stockpiling tens of billions in cash the fundamental problem with our economy is the same: a lack of consumer demand means substantial investment and hiring in the U.S. are often irrational from a business perspective. The nation’s sky-high unemployment and underemployment rates are the biggest immediate cause of the anemic demand. But a closer look at the long-term trends underlying consumer spending power suggests another, less recognized culprit lurking in the weeds: union busting.
To understand how a decades-long legacy of union busting is making our recovery harder, consider the role that organized labor has traditionally played in ensuring that working people – who make up most consumers -- receive a larger share of the economy’s gains and thus have money to spend consuming. Unions bargain collectively for better wages and benefits for their members. But unions also raise compensation for workers they don’t represent: a recent study by professors Bruce Western and Jake Rosenfeld finds that by scaring non-union employers into raising wages to avoid unionization, promoting norms of fair pay, and lobbying for public policies that raise wages, unions substantially boost compensation for non-union employees in addition to their own members. In short, high unionization boosts the share of economic growth going to working people rather than to corporate profits or the very highest earners. That is good for consumer spending given that Americans of moderate means are more likely to spend additional money than the wealthy, who already are consuming at their desired level, or corporations, which may just pile up more cash.
Unfortunately, though, unionization rates have been in decline for decades and the share of national income going to the middle class has fallen too. Meanwhile, the proportion of pay held by the highest-income Americans has shot up dramatically: in 2007, the top ten percent of households earned 49.7 percent of the nation’s income. Factors like globalization, technological change, and especially the demand for highly skilled workers that has put a premium on the value of a college education contribute to the divergence between the middle class and the wealthy, but Western and Rosenfeld make a powerful case that the decline of union representation was also a major influence – contributing as much as third to the growth of income inequality among working men since 1973. Without unions or any other organized force to fight for workers’ share of economic gains, the middle class is dwindling – and so is its purchasing power. This trend was obscured during the early 2000s as Americans tapped credit cards and rising home equity to support their consumer spending.
The disempowerment of working people is so complete that American workers have received just over one percent of income growth since the recession technically ended in the second quarter of 2009. Meanwhile 88 percent of real national income went to corporate profits. “The absence of any positive share of national income growth due to wages and salaries received by American workers during the current economic recovery is historically unprecedented” pronounced economists at Northeastern University who analyzed the numbers. No wonder corporations are sitting on tremendous cash reserves and working people can’t generate enough demand to give businesses a reason to hire.
Polls show that far more American workers would like to be part of a union than is now the case. The decline of organized labor can be attributed to a number of factors, including the decline of traditionally unionized industries in manufacturing and the unwillingness of some union leadership to invest in new organizing. But another major factor is also at work: a decades-long effort by big business lobbyists to water down the nation’s labor regulations so that corporations can, with near impunity, obstruct their employees’ efforts to choose a union.
An analysis of union elections from 1999 to 2003 revealed that when workers attempted to organize a union, 96 percent of employers mounted a campaign against their effort. Three quarters of employers hired outside consultants. So while many workers wish to join unions, they often change their minds after an intimidating one-on-one anti-union meeting with their direct supervisor once a week or more leading up to a union election (a tactic employers used in 66 percent of organizing campaigns), after their boss threatens to close down the workplace if workers decide to unionize (57 percent of organizing campaigns), or after those co-workers who most openly support the union are fired (34 percent of organizing campaigns). 
The wide prevalence of modern day union-busting helps explain stagnant household incomes for the middle class amid record corporate profits. Long term, though, it is hard to see business can thrive in an economy where workers have limited spending power as the lion’s share of income gains goes to top earners. Moreover, simply adding new jobs won’t reverse this situation if those jobs pay low wages, which is now the case.
In the Great Recession, the economy lost the most middle-class jobs, but the new jobs created since are disproportionally low-wage positions. To the extent we are seeing new job growth, it is disproportionately for positions like retail sales, cashiers, and food preparation workers, jobs with a median wage between $9 and $11 an hour and often no benefits.
In the heyday of union organizing, collective bargaining transformed poorly paid jobs like these into decent positions that enabled working people to support their families and earn a middle-class standard of living, supporting consumption that, in turn, sustained the economy. This can happen again if elected leaders take action to reinforce the nation’s weakened labor laws, making it easier for workers to join unions and expand their slice of the economic pie. The most important step Congress could take is to pass the Employee Free Choice Act (EFCA), which would streamline the process of forming unions in the workplace and prohibit some current forms of union-busting by employers. 
Two Years ago, the EFCA was buried in the Senate by the threat of filibuster and its prospects in Congress remain bleak. But, with consumer spending remaining flat and GDP growth anemic, it is time that Congress recognized the stronger unions are one obvious way to put more into the pockets of Americans workers and get this economy moving again.",blog
"The recent State of the Union address showcased the particular brand of phony populism that Americans are coming to know all too well. 
It’s a populism that demonizes immigrants as the main threat to struggling workers. It’s a populism that loudly claims credit for lowering African American unemployment.
Meanwhile, the Department of Labor pushes new rules that allow restaurant owners to redirect billions of dollars of servers’ tips into their own pockets and quietly guts the federal office protecting homebuyers from discrimination. It is a populism that serves mainly to distract and divide us.
It doesn’t have to be this way. Instead, policymakers, grassroots organizations and other thought leaders can embrace an authentic, multiracial economic populism that places both race and class at the forefront. This kind of policy must account for inequities of gender, sexual orientation, and other social cleavages that are used to oppress and separate us.
Policies should genuinely address the economic challenges faced by working people and the families they support, while also directly challenging the racism that saturates American politics and policy. We’ve recently brought together concrete proposals to lift up working people of all backgrounds.
Labor
And so, instead of a throwaway line about supporting paid family leave, we need national policies that recognize that the American workplace is still built for a male worker with a wife available to provide care for children, aging relatives and loved ones who fall sick.
Yet, this norm never applied to most households of color or LGBTQ households, and does not apply to the majority of American households today. Most families with children have all adults in the workforce, and mothers are key breadwinners. A policy grounded in these realities would guarantee paid time for all working people to care for loved ones in need, without restrictions on the type of workers — or the type of families — that qualify.
When we acknowledge that today’s working class consists primarily of women and people of color, often putting in irregular hours for low pay in the service sector, it is clear that truly putting working people first requires action to raise the minimum wage and eligibility for overtime pay, ensure fair work schedules, prevent wage theft, and protect against discrimination and harassment in the workplace. 
Phony populism insists corporate tax cuts are the best way to serve the interests of working Americans. Real populism demands that working people have the freedom to join together in unions and negotiate with their employers for a fair return on their work.
Environment
Rather than easy applause for acts of individual heroism in the face of climate disasters, we need policies that promote climate equity, targeting the corporate interests that put our lives at risk by continuing to extract, sell and burn fossil fuels.
We must recognize that communities of color bear a disproportionate burden of environmental ruin, and work toward a just transition to renewable energy that makes corporate polluters pay their fair share for the damage they do. We need to invest in the people and places most devastated by our reliance on dirty energy, and in the working people who will be displaced from jobs in the fossil fuel industry.
Finally, we must increase funding for disaster recovery and resiliency, targeting the communities likely to be hardest hit, so our survival is not contingent on heroic deeds or charitable efforts.
Education
A fizzy stock market may buoy those lucky enough to have college savings accounts (until the next crash), but it offers no solution for the millions of American families who are living paycheck to paycheck — yet aspire to help their children attend college and attain a better future. 
Soaring tuition at public colleges and universities is largely the result of states’ decisions to disregard what used to be a public responsibility, shifting more college costs onto students and families. And because families of color have been excluded from opportunities to build wealth over generations, they are less likely to afford college up front, and more likely to face difficulty repaying student loans. 
Policy rooted in those facts will increase public investment so that students can live and study without taking on debt. At the same time, policymakers must address the $1.4 trillion in outstanding student loan debt that weighs down families. 
The “New American Demos” — people of color, single women, young people, and working-class Americans of all races — is hungry for policies that actually address their lives and struggles. To elevate the policy conversation and advance the interests of working people in 2018 and beyond, we must commit to a race-forward populist economic agenda that will enable all of us to thrive.

"“Must have good credit.” 
	The phrase appears in help wanted ads for well-paid jobs as accountants and insurance agents, but also for low-wage positions as dog walkers, retail sales associates, restaurant servers, and maintenance workers. If a job applicant’s debts are high, they’ve suffered a foreclosure or a bankruptcy, or they’ve simply struggled to pay bills on time, a prospective employer can legally hold these flaws in personal credit history against them. The process may turn down well-qualified job-seekers—a devastating prospect for a household already finding it difficult to make ends meet. The truth is, the very practice of employment credit checks reinforces inequality and can perpetuate poverty and racial discrimination.
	Employment credit checks are common for a wide range of positions. Nearly half of employers surveyed by the Society for Human Resources Management in 2012 say they check credit when doing at least some of their hiring. My own research, a study of low- and middle-income Americans with credit card debt, finds that within the survey population, one in seven job applicants with blemished credit reports say that they have been turned down for a job because of their credit. 
	Despite their pervasiveness, credit reports – a product developed to help lenders make loan decisions – have never been proven reliable for employment. Credit checks are marketed to employers as a means to gauge an applicant’s character, sense of responsibility, or likelihood to commit theft or fraud. Yet there is little peer-reviewed evidence to back up these claims. A spokesperson for TransUnion, one of the major credit reporting companies, even admitted: “we don’t have any research to show any statistical correlation between what’s in somebody’s credit report and their job performance or their likelihood to commit fraud.”
	My research on low- and middle-income households carrying credit card debt finds that poor credit is associated with factors that may reflect the weak economy or a debtor’s personal misfortune but have little to do with how well a job applicant would perform at work. I found that households with flawed credit history are more likely to have experienced household unemployment, lack of health coverage in their families, and medical debt. In other words, many people run up debts because they have been out of work or have high medical bills, not because they are necessarily irresponsible people who cannot be trusted on the job. High error rates in credit reports means that a job applicant may not even have incurred the debts found in their credit history. ",media
"Fast food companies keep employees at poverty-level wages while reaping billions of dollars in profits. It drives inequality, slows growth, and lowers living standards.
There is a growing, industry-wide movement for the fast food economy to work for everyone. This Thursday, August 29th, workers have called for a national strike that is expected to cross company lines and reach dozens of cities.
The fast food labor force has never been protected by collective bargaining power or labor scarcity, making their demands for higher wages and the right to organize a unique historical event. It is also a bold stance from workers made vulnerable by a frail economy, asking for benefits that reach well beyond their own household budgets to the economy as a whole.
Right now, fast food companies keep employees at poverty-level wages while reaping billions of dollars in profits for their shareholders every year. Across the economy this practice drives increasing inequality, slow growth, and declining living standards. It is holding back our economic recovery and contributing to our high poverty rates and rates of working poor. Americans deserve better. The fast food workers’ movement shows that there is a broad demand for change—one that is only getting stronger.
There are many reasons why CEOs from Burger King to Wendy’s should embrace this opportunity to take the lead in a new economic model, and why consumers and communities can get behind their friends and neighbors in the call for fair pay. The top ten reasons listed here show how we are all tied to the success of the fast food workers’ movement, and why it will eventually succeed.
Low wages are holding back economic growth, but a raise for our country’s lowest paid workers would put money in the pockets of those most likely to spend it, generating much-needed consumer demand and contributing to economic growth across industries. That translates to higher GDP and new hiring in the labor market.
More than ten million Americans—and the family members they support—live beneath the poverty line even though they have jobs. With a median wage of $8.85, a fast food cook in a family of three lives in poverty even if she never takes a day off. Raising wages in the fast food industry could improve living standards for millions of hard working people.
With annual profits in the billions, the largest fast food companies could raise wages for their entire workforce and shareholders would still see a return. In fact, many of these employers already do pay higher wages to workers in other countries without wrecking their bottom lines.
It would take one million hours of work for a McDonald’s crewmember to earn what the company’s CEO took home last year—a gap that has doubled in the past decade. Inequality is correlated to a host of social problems, from worsening mental and physical health to diminished mobility and social cohesion. The growth of low-wage work as a share of the economy means that raising wages for these professions is a critical move in slowing the growth of inequality and the undesirable outcomes it creates.
Low-wage jobs are a business choice, but some employers take the high road offering fair wages, hours, and benefits. This investment in the workforce pays off in lower turnover and higher worker productivity, generating good service to customers and a solid bottom line.
When employers pay poverty-level wages they shift the cost of maintaining a labor force onto society. If fast food workers earned a living wage they would not have to rely on food stamps, Medicaid, or other poverty alleviation programs when paychecks don’t provide the means to make ends meet. Data from Missouri, Massachusetts, and Wisconsin show that fast food companies like McDonalds, Pizza Hut, Wendy’s, Subway, and Taco Bell are some of the largest recipients of these public subsidies as they push their labor costs on to taxpayers.
Workers—like shareholders, customers, and the communities served—are stakeholders in the fast food industry and deserve a say in what they do. CEOs and companies that offer paternalistic advice about how to scrape by at the bottom are failing to meet their obligations to these groups. Workers, who are well-aware of the demands of their jobs, customers, and communities, have a right to pressure their corporate bosses and make sure that the expectations of all of their stakeholders are heard.
Increasing the standard for decent pay in fast food could be a boon to low-wage workers across industries. The ripple effects start with increased consumer demand and economic growth, and create pressure in the labor market to raise wages in other low-pay positions. Contrary to popular myth, the vast majority of those affected by a raise at the bottom are working adults, struggling to make ends meet for themselves and their families. Even in fast food, most workers are 21 or older and have at least a high school degree. Raising wages in fast food could impact living standards for millions of American workers and the families that depend on them.
Economic gains over the past generation have largely accrued to the top earners, and low-wage workers have seen their earnings drop, even as they became better educated and more productive. While Congress allowed the minimum wage to sink to just two thirds of its historical peak, firms directed more and more of the value produced by labor to earners at the top. Now, with an economy that is richer than ever before, fast food workers are taking the initiative that government and business neglected and demanding a better set of rules for our economy.
The American Dream is a commitment to the opportunity for every person to achieve a better life if she works hard and plays by the rules. But rather than a launching pad to get ahead, fast food and other low-wage jobs hold workers back, offering few chances at career advancement and wages too low to make saving or investments in the future a real possibility. We can reclaim the American Dream for many of those who have been left out by raising wages at the bottom and giving hard working Americans a chance to get ahead.

"From the time a baby is born, American families are trapped between the need to provide care for their children and the necessity of earning income. The crisis of care is most acute when children are too young to be in school: we find that families with children under age 5 have significantly lower incomes and higher poverty rates than households with no children at all. Yet incomes rise and poverty rates fall once the youngest child reaches kindergarten age and universal schooling is available to help families meet childcare obligations.
This report looks more closely at the economic conditions facing parents of young children. We explore the demographics and economic data on households with children under 5 and use regression analysis to examine the differences between households with young children, those with no children, and households where all children have reached school age (see the appendix for details on the regression analysis). We consider the especially difficult circumstances facing single parents—particularly single mothers—and parents of color. And we investigate how policies in the workplace and the larger economy—including unstable work schedules, a lack of paid leave, low pay, employment discrimination, and a severe shortage of high-quality, affordable childcare—exacerbate the pressures that leave parents trapped. Finally we discuss the actions both private employers and public policymakers can take to better support families with young children and enable hard-working parents to escape this trap and raise their families without facing severe hardship. Among our findings:
 
Being a good parent is always a challenging job. Striving to provide the next generation with the opportunity to succeed, parents offer their love, support, encouragement, and guidance. Yet working parents in America also face an additional set of challenges: from the time a baby is born, families are trapped between the need to provide care for their children and the need to earn income. The crisis of care is most acute when children are too young to be in school: families with children under age 5 have significantly lower incomes and higher poverty rates than households with older children or none at all. Unstable work schedules, a lack of paid leave, low pay, and a severe shortage of high- quality, affordable childcare compound the strain on American parents.
This report looks more closely at the economic conditions that trap the parents of young children between supporting their families and providing care. We explore the demographics and empirical economic data on households with children under 5 and use regression analysis to examine the differences between households with young children, those with no children, and households where all children have reached school age (see the appendix for details on the regression analysis). We consider the especially difficult circumstances facing single parents—particularly single mothers—and parents of color. And we investigate how policies in the workplace and the larger economy exacerbate the pressures that leave parents trapped. Finally, we discuss the actions both private employers and public policymakers can take to better support families with young children and enable hard-working parents to escape the trap and raise their families without facing severe hardship.
The reality today is that most parents must work even when their children are young. As growing numbers of women have entered the workforce in recent decades, families increasingly depend on the incomes of all working-age adults in the household. In nearly 2 out of 3 families with a child under age 5, all parents in the household are employed. As Figure 1 shows, the proportions are even higher in households headed by single mothers and fathers.1 In nearly 4 out of 10 households with children, mothers earned half or more of family income. A majority of mothers with infants under a year old worked outside the home in 2014, and more than two-thirds of mothers worked outside the home before their children reach school age. 

While parents are on the job, babies and young children still need care. The U.S. Census Bureau last analyzed childcare arrangements in 2011, focusing on children under age 5. According to this analysis, shown in Figure 2, 61 percent of young children were in some type of regular childcare arrangement while a parent was working or in school.2 More than 2 out of every 5 young children were cared for by a grandparent, sibling, or another relative. A third of children under age 5 were in non-relative care, including day care centers, preschool, family day care, or another non-relative arrangement. 

But the trap that confronts families as they strive to both earn a living and care for their children is more complex than simply working and seeking childcare. A survey by Pew Research Center finds that half of all working parents report experiencing a major job or career interruption—reducing their work hours, taking a significant amount of time off, quitting a job, or turning down a promotion—in order to care for a child or other family member.3 While women were substantially more likely than men to interrupt their working lives for caregiving, many men also saw their jobs impacted: 1 in 4 fathers reported that they had reduced work hours or taken a significant amount of time off work to provide care.
In a separate survey, fully half of fathers said they had stopped working, switched to a less challenging job, or passed up a job opportunity in order to allow more time to care for their children.4 Overwhelmingly, working parents report that they are glad they interrupted their work trajectory for caregiving, yet many also say their jobs and careers suffered as a result.5 Perhaps unsurprisingly, 62 percent of all young, childless workers anticipate difficulties advancing at work if and when they have a baby.6
Caring for young children while also earning the income to support them should not have to entail such arduous trade-offs. The concluding section of this paper explores improved business practices and public policy solutions that could help ease the strain on young families, improving the lives of parents and children and improving the odds that having a baby will no longer leave households broke. 
 
In 2014, 27 million Americans between the age of 18 and 64 were parents living with a child under 5. A close look at these families yields critical insights. As Figure 3 shows, the parents of children under age 5 are younger, more likely to live in poverty, and more likely to be Latino or Asian-Americans than other adults age 18-64.7 We also find that among working-age adults, parents of young children are more likely to live with a spouse or other partner. 

Overall, 86 percent of parents with a child under 5 live with a partner, while 14 percent are single. Women comprise 89 percent of single parent households with young children. Overall, 55 percent of parents living with young children are mothers. Most young children also live with at least one sibling: on average, households with a young child have 2 children.
The parents of young children have diverse educational backgrounds. More than a third have a high school diploma or less, while just over a third hold a bachelor’s degree or more. About 28 percent of parents of young children have some college education, including people who hold an associate’s degree or other certificate and those who have enrolled in college but not received a degree. Parents currently enrolled in college also form part of this group.
Parents of young children are more likely than other working-age adults to be people of color. While Latinos make up just 15 percent of adults without children and 19 percent of parents with older children, they represent 22 percent of adults with young children. The parents of young children are also significantly more likely to be Asian-American than adults without children.
As Figure 4 shows, over the last 20 years the proportion of parents that identify as white has declined steadily: in 1994, 69 percent of parents with a child under 5 was white, compared to 57 percent in 2014. Over the same period, the proportion of parents of young children who identify as Latino, Asian-American, or “other” has increased by 67 percent, while the proportion who are black declined slightly. 

Families with children under age 5 have lower incomes than families with no children or those whose children are older. As Figure 5 depicts, parents of young children who lived with a spouse or other partner had a median household income of $72,085, compared to $82,974 for partners who had no children and $90,127 for partnered parents of older children. For parents of color, the lower income level associated with having a young child is compounded by the broader labor market disadvantages faced by people of color, as shown in Figure 6. Black and Latino parents who live with a spouse or other partner earn $31,393 and $39,549 less, respectively, than their partnered white counterparts. This gap is almost entirely a reflection of general racial income disparities rather than different responses to having children.
Single parents consistently have lower incomes. At the median, single parents of young children had a household income of $22,026, compared to $35,042 for single adults with no children and $33,179 for single parents of older children. Single black and Latina mothers of young children earn $5,309 and $1,304 less, respectively, than single white mothers.
Nearly 1 in 5 parents of young children live in poverty, a significantly higher poverty rate than for adults living without children or those with older children. The poverty rate for single parents is higher still: a devastating 46 percent for single parents with a young child, compared to 20 percent for single adults with no children and 27 percent for single parents with a child older than 5. Black and Latino parents confront still higher poverty rates. 


Yet these disparities in income and poverty reflect not only the impact of having a young child but also the differing demographics of each group, discussed above. For example, a lower median income among households with young children can be explained in part by the fact that adults with young children tend to be younger themselves and less advanced in their careers. To better understand the effect of having a young child independent of these other factors, we conducted a statistical analysis controlling for differences in age, education, and race to determine the impact of having a young child on households’ income, poverty, labor force participation and unemployment. The next section of this report discusses that analysis. 
The competing demands of work and caregiving place a particularly heavy burden on families with children too young to attend school, since young children require care for more hours of the day and purchasing childcare is considerably more expensive for babies and toddlers. Evidence of the strain is visible in family incomes and poverty rates. We find that even after controlling for differences in age, education, and race, families with young children face an income penalty ranging from $14,850 for partnered households to $16,609 for single women. These income differences, combined with an increased family size, are enough to throw many families into poverty: as shown in Figure 7, single mothers are 15 percent more likely to live in poverty than single women without children, after controlling for other factors. Partnered mothers and fathers face poverty rates about 3 percent higher than their counterparts with no children. 

For parents of color, the income penalty associated with having a young child is compounded by the broader labor market disadvantages faced by people of color. Although our regression results show that the child income penalty is no larger for parents of color than for white parents, parents of color still earn lower wages than their white counterparts due to lower education levels, labor market discrimination, occupational segregation, and other factors. These factors combine to make it even harder for parents of color to make ends meet.
Differences in employment and labor force participation contribute substantially to the income penalty associated with having a young child. Having a young child has the strongest effect on whether mothers who live with a partner are in the labor force: after controlling for other factors, their labor force participation is 19 percent lower than partnered women without children, as illustrated in Figure 8. This effect is magnified for less-educated mothers of young children: after controlling for other factors, partnered mothers with a high school diploma or less are 21 percent less likely to be in the labor force than their counterparts without children. The cost of childcare is likely the primary cause of these lower labor force participation rates: mothers with less education generally earn lower wages, meaning that the expense of childcare may exceed—or nearly exceed—what they could earn outside the home (for more on the cost of child care, see page 20). Particularly when they have working partners, mothers with less education are spurred to leave the workforce and stay home with their children full-time.
Partnered fathers are pushed in the opposite direction: after controlling for other factors they are more likely to be in the labor force than their counterparts without children—regardless of their education level. While polling suggests that younger fathers have much more egalitarian attitudes about family, career and gender roles than previous generations and would like to embrace more childcare responsibilities, the persistent gap in earning potential between men and women means that household incomes are higher if men work.17
With no partner to help provide income, single parents of both genders are more likely to seek work when their children are young. After controlling for other factors, single mothers and fathers participate in the labor force at significantly higher rates—3 percent and 9 percent, respectively—than comparable adults without children. However, while labor force participation reflects a willingness and availability for work, it does not necessarily guarantee that the job seeker is successful
in finding employment. As shown in Figure 9, single mothers of young children face a particularly elevated rate of unemployment: 16 percent, overall, with even higher unemployment rates among single mothers of color and those with less education. 
The higher unemployment rate for single parents may reflect both employers’ unwillingness to hire single parents and the difficulty of fulfilling caregiving responsibilities while holding on to a job—particularly a job that lacks basic benefits like paid sick days or has an irregular or unstable schedule. Indeed, the data suggests that single parents with young children deal with significantly more unstable employment than other parents. Controlling for other factors, we find that 11 percent of single mothers and 12 percent of single fathers with young children had a job in the past year but not in the previous week when they were surveyed, compared to 4 percent and 6 percent of partnered men and women with young children. 


As children reach school age, the trap that grips parents of young children eases somewhat. Partnered mothers, who were disproportionately likely to leave the workforce when their children were young, are more likely to return once their youngest child is in school. Unemployment rates for single parents decline. Incomes rise and poverty rates fall. For parents living with a partner, having the youngest child reach age 5 increases household income by more than $29,000, after controlling for other factors. In fact, parents of older children who live with a partner earn between 12 and 14 percent more than comparable adults without children, after controlling for other factors. The additional income is hardly a luxury, since raising children is also a significant additional expense. Single fathers also see their income penalty all but disappear as their children become older. Having children reach school age increases the incomes of single mothers by $25,651 after controlling for other factors, helping single mothers recover half of the income lost when they had young children. These higher incomes are reflected in their poverty rate: single mothers of school-age children are 6 percent less likely to be in poverty than their counterparts with children under 5, after controlling for other factors. 
 
For many new parents there is no respite from the competing pressures of earning income and providing care, even during the later stages of pregnancy or when a baby is first born. While paid time to care for and bond with a new baby are the norm in virtually every other country, the U.S. guarantees only unpaid time off work under the Family and Medical Leave Act.8 The FMLA ensures that working people can take up to 12 weeks to care for a new child without losing their jobs—yet due to restrictions on eligibility, even that protection does not reach about 40 percent of working Americans.9
In the absence of a federal guarantee, offering paid time to care is left to the states and to employers’ own discretion. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, just 13 percent of working people had access to paid family leave through their employers in 2014—and those with this benefit were more likely to be higher paid and working in professional jobs.10 Black and Latino workers are less likely than their white and Asian-American counterparts to have access to paid time.11 Meanwhile, only 5 states guaranteed new parents any type of paid time to care.12 As a result, millions of mothers and fathers face financial pressure to return to work just a few weeks after a baby enters the family, despite a growing body of medical research showing the importance of parental bonding for the babies’ health and development—as well as parents’ own well-being.13
The lack of paid parental leave also plays a role in the lower incomes of families with young children and the lower labor force participation and higher unemployment rates faced by mothers of young children. The Census Bureau reports that about 1 in 5 mothers without parental leave quit their jobs during pregnancy or after the birth of a baby.14 On the other side, researchers find that new mothers with access to paid time to care are nearly 70 percent more likely than those without any paid time to come back to work three months to one year after having a child.15 Mothers who take paid time are also more likely to return to their previous employer and to be compensated at their former pay level or to be paid more, while 31 percent of mothers who have to change employers after having a baby see their compensation decline.16 These findings suggest that if America’s working parents had access to paid time to care, parents trapped between work and care would see their economic bind ease. 
 
 
Nearly 2 out of 3 low-wage workers in the U.S.—the employees who can least afford to miss a paycheck—do not have a single paid sick day to take care of sick child (much less themselves).18 Many low-wage workers even risk losing their jobs and employer-provided health coverage if they call in sick. According to one survey, 1 in 6 Americans says that they or a family member have been fired, suspended, punished, or threatened by an employer for missing work due to illness or to care for a sick child—making employment more precarious, especially for single parents.19 Latino workers are by far the least likely to have access to paid sick time.20 A growing number of states, cities, and counties have acted to guarantee workers a right to earn paid sick days, but the United States as a whole still offers no such guarantee. 
 
Irregular and unpredictable work schedules can turn the effort to care for young children while earning enough to support them into a grueling ordeal for working parents. In an effort to minimize their labor costs, employers in industries such as retail, hospitality, and personal services increasingly use scheduling software and measures of consumer demand to match workers’ hours to the projected need for labor on a daily or even hourly basis. As a result, the Economic Policy Institute finds that at least 17 percent of the U.S. workforce has an unstable schedule: 10 percent of workers have an irregular or on-call, often unpredictable, work schedule, and an additional 7 percent work split or rotating shifts.21 A study of workers age 26 to 32 found that people of color were more likely than white workers to receive their work schedule with less than a week’s advance notice.22
Unpredictably-shifting schedules are a double blow for working parents of young children, making it harder to arrange care at the same time that it becomes more difficult to earn a stable income. Parents with shifting work schedules may have difficulty arranging childcare and transportation at the last minute and scheduling essentials like doctor’s appointments. Employees who are paid hourly and see the number of hours worked shift from week to week will also bring home varying paychecks, making it very difficult to budget, particularly since the lowest-paid workers tend to have the most unstable schedules. Not surprisingly, 26 percent of workers with irregular schedules report “often” experiencing conflict between work and family responsibilities, more than twice the rate of those on more regular work schedules.23
 
Trying to support a family on wages that don’t cover the cost of essentials like housing, food, health coverage, transportation and clothing—much less the expense of childcare for young children—leaves parents trapped. In 2013, workers needed to earn at least $11.45 an hour and work full-time just to support a family of 4 at the official poverty threshold. Yet as the Economic Policy Institute points out, 27 percent of all workers earned wages below that level in 2013.24 An income sufficient to meet families’ actual basic needs is out of reach for even more working people. Workers of color are disproportionately low-paid, with 42 percent of Latino workers and 36 percent of Black workers paid poverty wages. Absent significant policy change, the wage picture is not expected to improve substantially, even if the economy continues to recover and grow: of the 10 occupations projected to add the greatest number of new jobs by 2022, only one (registered nurses) pays more than $32,500 per year at the median.25 As a result, many families will continue to struggle to provide for children on wages that fall short.
Children are expensive. At the same time that parents strive to earn income and care for their children, they also face the increased expense of having a baby, including hospital and medical bills from the birth itself and regular costs like diapers, formula and food. And while higher-income families spend more money on raising children in absolute terms, lower-income households expend a greater proportion of the incomes. The USDA finds that on average, households with an annual pre-tax income below $61,530 spent 25 percent of their before-tax income on a child, while those making between $61,530 and $106,540 a year spent 16 percent of their income on a child and higher income families spent 12 percent.26 
 
Faced with the costs of raising children on an inconsistent or inadequate income, many parents are driven to borrow money in an effort to make ends meet. Debt is both an outcome of the pressures parents face and a pressure that can itself trap parents as interest and fees accumulate. Among low- and middle-income households with credit cards, having children is one of the strongest predictors of indebtedness: households that include children younger than 18 years of age are 15 percent more likely to be carrying credit card debt from month to month than childless households.27 Half of indebted households with children say they have used their credit cards to pay for basic living expenses (such as rent or mortgage payments, groceries, utilities, or insurance) in the past year because they did not have enough money in their checking or savings accounts—a share significantly higher than that of households without children.28
At the same time, keeping up with debt imposes its own costs: indebted households with children report paying an average $395.86 in credit card bills within the last month. The use of payday loans is also significantly more common among families raising children, particularly those with low and moderate incomes.29 Eventually, borrowing may reach a level that can no longer be sustained. In her seminal 2004 book, The Two- Income Trap, (now Senator) Elizabeth Warren found that the presence of children was the biggest predictor of whether a household would file for bankruptcy.30 Her study concluded that married couples with children not only file for bankruptcy at twice the rate of childless couples but also have a higher probability of paying bills late and experiencing foreclosure. 
 
Discrimination against pregnant workers and employees who have caregiving responsibilities is another factor that may keep parents out of work or harm their advancement on the job. The Center for WorkLife Law defines family responsibility discrimination as occurring when job applicants and workers are “rejected for hire, passed over for promotion, demoted, harassed, or terminated—despite good performance—simply because their employers make personnel decisions based on stereotypical notions of how they will or should act given their family responsibilities.”31 Mothers confront a particularly unforgiving employment environment. A Cornell University study found that mothers were judged to be significantly less competent and committed than equally qualified women without children and were held to more stringent standards of job performance and punctuality.32
Ultimately, mothers were significantly less likely to be recommended for hire or to be promoted, and were offered an average of $11,000 less in salary for the same position as the equally qualified women who were not mothers. The study found that men were not generally penalized for being a parent, although men who take family leave or seek to actively care for their children may also face discrimination. While there is no federal law that explicitly prohibits employers from discriminating against their employees on the basis of family caregiving responsibilities, parents have some protection from discrimination under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, the Civil Rights Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act and state and local statutes. 
 
The ability to make decisions about whether and when to become a parent is critical to families’ economic security. Having a child is one of life’s most serious commitments, economically and otherwise; an unintended pregnancy can upend financial stability, making it difficult for mothers in particular to pursue education and maintain employment. Yet in 2011, 45 percent of U.S. pregnancies were un- intended.33 Black and Latina women, young women, and women living below the poverty line were the most likely to experience an unintended pregnancy.34 Women’s lack of access to effective birth control and abortion compounds the inequalities that already exist, tightening the parent trap for the most vulnerable women and their families.
On contraception, public policy is making a positive difference: recent studies find that access to birth control and the use of highly effective contraceptive methods is increasing due to the Affordable Care Act’s expansion of health insurance coverage and the law’s mandate that insurers cover contraception as a form of preventive care—in most cases without cost to consumers.35 Yet gaps remain, including exemptions for some employers on religious grounds; federal guidelines that permit insurers to charge copayments for some brand-name contraceptive drugs; and failures by insurers or pharmacies to comply with the law.36 And women who still lack insurance—including many low-income residents of states that have refused to expand Medicaid eligibility— are excluded from expanded contraceptive coverage.37 The Kaiser Family Foundation also estimates that there are at least an additional 1.9 million women of childbearing age who will remain ineligible for contraceptive and other health coverage under the Affordable Care Act due to their immigration status.38
At the same time, access to abortion is becoming more limited. Between 2011 and 2015, states enacted 288 restrictions on abortion services, including banning some abortions, imposing waiting periods, putting restrictions on the providers allowed to perform abortion procedures, and limiting insurance coverage.39 These restrictions have the greatest impact on low-income women, who can least afford to travel long distances to an open clinic or a less-restrictive state. The groundbreaking “Turnaway Study” from the University of California, San Francisco found that most women who seek abortion are already struggling financially, and many cite poverty as their main reason to seek abortion.40 Moreover, a woman who is turned away for an abortion is three times more likely to be in poverty two years after the fact than her counterpart who is able to access the procedure.41 Limits on reproductive freedom form a punishing part of the trap that con- strains women and their families. 
 
Every week, nearly 7 million children under age 5 are cared for by someone other than a relative or legal guardian.42 Children go to day care centers; attend nursery schools, preschools, and Head Start programs; and are cared for by childcare providers in the child’s home or the provider’s home. Often this care is costly and difficult to secure. A 2015 Washington Post poll of parents with children under 18 living at home finds that only 10 percent say childcare in their area is not too expensive or is not expensive at all.43 A third of parents assert that childcare is extremely expensive. At the same time, half of parents say finding quality and affordable childcare has been difficult, including 21 percent who say it is very difficult.
The cost of childcare varies dramatically by the age of the child, the type of care, and the state where the family lives. According to the research and advocacy group Child Care Aware, the average cost of full-time care for a single infant in center-based care ranged from $4,822 a year in Mississippi to $17,062 in Massachusetts.44 At the other end of the spectrum, costs for a 4-year-old cared for in a childcare provider’s home ranged from $3,675 in Mississippi to $10,030 in Alaska. The expense adds up quickly: Child Care Aware estimates married couples earning the median family income in their state would have to spend 6.8 percent to 15 percent of their income to pay for center-based care for their infant during a full workweek. For single parents the costs can be even more overwhelming—in every state annual costs of center-based infant care averaged over 40 percent of the state median income for single mothers. Having 2 or more children in need of care further raises the costs.
How can families afford such steep bills? Low- and moderate-income households may be eligible for public subsidies: nationwide approximately 900,000 families with 1.5 million children receive public help paying for childcare.45 The funds primarily come from the federal government through the Childcare and Development Block Grant, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and the Social Services Block grant. However, since states administer the federal funds, and may add their own subsidies, eligibility varies widely. In general, families in poverty are the most likely to receive childcare assistance, yet as incomes rise, help paying for care may be cut off before families are capable of managing the costs on their own. According to the National Women’s Law Center, a family with an income above 150 percent of poverty ($30,135 a year for a family of three in 2015) could not qualify for any public childcare subsidy in 17 states.46 A family with an income above 200 percent of poverty ($40,180 a year for a family of three in 2015) could not qualify for assistance in 39 states. In addition, funds may run out before all eligible families receive subsidies: in 2015, 21 states had waiting lists for childcare assistance or had frozen intake of new families applying for assistance.47
While this paper focuses on economics, the reality is that few families see childcare as purely a pocketbook issue. As they go to work, parents want to feel confident that their children are in a safe and nurturing environment and have opportunities for stimulation and learning. Yet there is wide variation in state standards for childcare centers and home-based care, as well as the qualifications of childcare providers. Childcare Aware reports that 31 states require a high school diploma or less for childcare center lead teachers, while 41 states require a high school diploma or less for regulated family childcare providers.48 When childcare workers do earn degrees or attain additional training, their income often does not rise in tandem with their increased qualifications, according to the Center for the Study of Child Care Employment.49 In 2012, the median childcare worker earned just $19,510 per year, a poverty wage that does not enable childcare workers to support their own families.50 Not surprisingly, turnover in the childcare workforce is high, meaning children are less likely to have stable and consistent caregivers and quality is reduced.
For 3- and 4-year-olds, nursery and preschool programs offer both care and a more structured form of early education. During the 2014-2015 school year, 41 percent of 4-year-olds and 16 percent of 3-year-olds were in a public preschool program, either a state- or locally-funded preschool or federal/ state funded Head Start and Early Head Start.51 According to the National Institute for Early Education Research, more than half a million children, or 40 percent of nationwide preschool enrollment, were served in programs that met fewer than half of the quality standards benchmarks, which include staff-to-child ratios and requirements that teachers have bachelor’s degrees and specialized training in early childhood education. In preschool, as in childcare, low wages for teachers undercut professionalism and quality. And quality is key: while preschool has traditionally been treated as an optional part of children’s education, a growing body of research demonstrates that high-quality preschool programs offer substantial benefits—in both school and later life—for children who participate, as well as broader societal benefits.52
For parents, high-quality public preschool offers a respite from being trapped between caregiving and earning income, as well as an assurance that their children are receiving an excellent start to their education. 
 
Caring for young children while also earning the income to support them does not have to leave parents trapped. Improved business practices and public policy solutions could help to ease the strain on families with young children, improving the lives of parents and children and increasing the odds that having a baby will no longer leave households broke. In many cases, legislation has already been introduced in Congress that would improve the lives of parents and their children. In addition, public opinion polls show strong support for many of these policies.53 A leaked internal survey of corporate executives found that strong majorities of business leaders also favor policies that benefit the parents of young children, including family leave, paid sick time, and an increased minimum wage, even as their lobbying organization has worked against these policies.54 The nation lacks neither policy solutions nor public support to dismantle the economic vise that traps parents; policymakers simply need the political will to act.
Guarantee Time to Care: A paid leave insurance system would enable working parents to welcome a new child without sacrificing their entire paycheck. The FAMILY Act would guarantee workers up to 12 weeks of time for caregiving with partial income when they take time for the birth or adoption of a child or to care for themselves or a loved one with a serious health condition. It would cover employees of all companies, no matter what their size. The system would be funded by a small payroll tax on employers and employees, equivalent to $1.50 per week for the median worker. A recent poll of likely voters indicated that 76 percent favor a federal paid family leave system along the lines of the FAMILY Act, including support from 57 percent of Republicans.55 The Healthy Families Act would ensure that working parents don’t miss wages—or get fired—for staying home with a sick child or taking a little one in for a check-up. The bill would enable workers employed by businesses with 15 or more employees to accrue up to 7 paid sick days a year to use for their own illness, providing care for sick family members, or accessing preventive care. Under this legislation, employees of smaller companies would be guaranteed job protection, but not pay, for taking time off while sick. Opinion polls indicate bipartisan support for requiring employers to offer paid sick time.56
Raise Pay: At $7.25 an hour, the federal minimum wage is far too low for working parents to support their families, exacerbating the pressures that leave parents trapped between earning income and caring for children. Polling data has consistently shown strong support for raising the federal minimum wage, including a majority of Republican voters.57 The Raise the Wage Act, which would boost the federal minimum to $12 an hour by 2020, would lift pay for nearly 10 million working parents, including nearly 40 percent of all single working mothers.58 The Pay Workers a Living Wage Act would go further, increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. Meanwhile middle-income families—including nearly 5 million working parents—would benefit from strengthening federal overtime regulations, as the Department of Labor has issued regulations to do.59 By raising the salary threshold for workers to qualify for overtime pay, the proposed regulations ensure that parents (and other workers) will be fairly compensated for extra time spent on the job. Yet raising pay standards can only help working parents if employers follow the law. Improving enforcement of wage laws is critical: every year working people miss out on an estimated $50 billion or more when employers pay less than the minimum wage, oblige employees to work off the clock, misclassify their workforce as independent contractors, or otherwise violate laws on pay and hours.
Improve Schedules: Irregular and unpredictable work schedules make it harder for working parents to arrange childcare at the same time that it becomes more difficult to earn a stable income. Polls indicate that Americans support legislation to stabilize schedules, with 72 percent, including 62 percent of Republicans, saying they favor “requiring chain stores and fast-food outlets to give workers at least two weeks’ notice of any changes in their work schedules or provide them with extra pay.”60 The Schedules That Work Act would guarantee that employees in the retail, food service, and cleaning industries— among those most subject to irregular schedules—receive their schedules at least 2 weeks in advance and be paid for at least 4 hours on a shift. The legislation would also protect all workers from retaliation if they request more flexible, predictable or stable schedules from their employer and would set up a process for employers to consider workers’ scheduling requests.
Combat Discrimination: Employment discrimination can result in parents being unemployed or underpaid, making it more difficult to support a family. Expecting mothers, for example, may be forced out of their jobs because employers refuse minor adjustments that would allow them to maintain a healthy pregnancy and keep working. The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act would require employers to accommodate the basic health needs of pregnant workers, such as allowing workers to carry a water bottle, take an extra bathroom break, or sit on a chair. Meanwhile, the Paycheck Fairness Act would provide more broad-based protection against pay discrimination that often targets mothers by enabling workers to discuss their pay rates with colleagues without fear of retaliation, mandating that employers prove pay disparities exist for legitimate, job-related reasons, and making it easier to seek legal redress for discrimination. Further steps toward public pay transparency would enable working people to achieve greater equality and would give businesses an incentive to pay employees fairly. Public opinion surveys consistently find strong support for promoting pay equity.61 Existing discrimination laws—including those focused on race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability or genetic information, which may also affect parents—must also be vigorously enforced.
Guarantee Reproductive Rights: The ability to make decisions about whether and when to become a parent is critical to families’ economic security, so access to reproductive health services is vital. Opinion surveys find that 69 percent of Americans believe that contraception coverage should be a standard part of all health care plans.62 Congress must preserve the Affordable Care Act’s coverage of contraception without copays and resist efforts to cut federal funding to women’s health care offered by Planned Parenthood. Access to contraception should also be expanded by legislation such as the Affordability IS Access Act, which urges the Food and Drug Administration to make birth control pills available over the counter and ensures that birth control pills be fully covered by insurance without a copay even if they are dispensed without a prescription. At the same time, Congress should act to eliminate the Hyde Amendment, which currently prohibits Medicaid coverage for abortion services, making abortion unaffordable for many low-income women. Access to abortion would also be enhanced by the Women’s Health Protection Act which would push back against recent state limits on abortion by barring states from imposing abortion restrictions that do not apply to similar types of medical care, or that interfere with patient’s decisions, or otherwise impede access to safe abortion care.
Enhance Early Care and Learning: Public policy must aim to increase access to affordable, high-quality childcare. The American National Election Survey finds that a majority of Americans favor
an increase in government spending to help working parents pay for childcare.63 Increasing subsidies under the Childcare and Development Block Grant and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families block grant with the aim of eliminating waiting lists, expanding eligibility, raising standards for care and compensation for providers and allowing families to retain subsidies even if their work status and income fluctuates would enable more families to secure safe and nurturing care for their children. President Obama’s proposal to raise the maximum Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit to $3,000 and expand eligibility would be helpful to middle-class families struggling with the cost of care. Expanding Head Start and mobilizing federal funds to help states and cities establish universal preschool programs for 3- and 4-year-olds would aid working parents, their children, and society as a whole.
Policies by Workplace: Beyond what is legislated, employers can autonomously choose to pursue any and all of these policies for their own workforce: raising wages, improving schedules, providing leave, offering childcare, establishing safeguards against discrimination, and devising tailored policies to retain parents who have taken substantial time off work to care for children. At the same time, workers have greater power to negotiate for workplace policies that enable them to care for their families and earn enough to support them when they organize into unions and can negotiate collectively for these priorities. 
 
Summary statistics comparing households with no children, younger children, and older children show statistically significant differences between the three populations. In order to examine how much of those differences were due to the presence of children in the household, we ran several regressions to attempt to isolate the effect of childrearing on several economic variables. The regressions each used Current Population Survey data, pooled 2013-2015 Annual and Social and Economic Supplements (pooled to ensure sufficient sample sizes). The five variables we hypothesized that caring for a child might have a significant impact on are: log(income), poverty status, labor force participation (LFP), employment (among adults in the labor force), and hours worked; thus, these are the dependent variables of our five types of regressions. As the results below show, we ran separate regressions for adult men and women for each dependent variable to avoid an uninterpretable number of interaction terms.
Our hypothesis was that the age of a person’s youngest child would likely impact these variables differently; specifically, whether a person’s youngest child had reached school age. To test this, we divided adults into three groups: adults with no children younger than 18, adults whose youngest child was younger than 5, and adults whose youngest child was between age 5 and 17, inclusive. We also hypothesized that partnership status would impact the effect of childrearing on our dependent variables; thus, we interacted partnership status with the youngest child categories, as shown by our final four regressors in the regression output below. Finally, we controlled for education level, race group, and age/age squared in each.
The general model for each of the regressions was identical, changing only the dependent variable. Each regression took the form:
yi = β0 + β1age + β2age2 + β3educcat + β4racecat + β5single + β6ychild + β7ochild + β8 single * ychild + β9single * ochild
yi is one of the five dependent variables: log(income), average
hours worked per week, poverty status, labor force participation, or employment. An ordinary least squares model was used for the first two regressions, while a logit model was used for the following three. The first two variables are continuous variables, while the following three are binary variables.
age is a continuous variable representing the age of each adult.
age2 is a continuous variable representing the square of the age of each adult.
educcat is a categorical variable representing the educational category of each adult. It contains four categories: less than high school completed, high school diploma, some college or associate’s degree, or bachelor’s degree or higher.
racecat is a categorical variable representing the race or ethnicity category of each adult. It contains five categories: white, not Hispanic; black, not Hispanic; Hispanic; Asian-American; or other.
single is a binary variable indicating whether the adult is partnered or single.
ychild is a binary variable indicating whether the adult lives with a child younger than age 5.
ochild is a binary variable indicating whether the adult lives with a child age 5 to 17.
single*ychild is the interaction term for the relationship between the adult’s partnership status and whether they live with a child younger than age 5.
single*ochild is the interaction term for the relationship between the adult’s partnership status and whether they live with a child between age 5 and age 17.
Coefficient Interpretation: The baseline for all of the regressions is “partnered with no children under age 18.” Thus, the variables “older child” and “young child” below are the coefficients for partnered individuals with young and older children, respectively. To get the coefficients for single parents, we have to add the coefficients for, for example, young child + the interaction term (single:young child).
The interpretation of the OLS coefficients is straightforward: the percent increase or decrease in log(income) or average hours worked for adults with young and older children, by gender and partnership status.
For the coefficients of the logit regressions, the interpretation is a little less straightforward. The coefficient of a binary or categorical explanatory variable (which describes all of our explanatory variables) in a logit regression can be interpreted as the log of the ratio of the odds of “success”—i.e. LFP, unemployment, poverty—when the explanatory variable is 0 and when it is 1, holding all other variables constant.1
Thus, to get the coefficients into a more easily-interpretable form, i.e. a predicted percent change, we have to linearize them. To do so, we take the first derivative of each coefficient: , where is the coefficient for the explanatory variable and is the population proportion for the dependent variable when the explanatory variable is equal to zero.
For example, in the female labor force participation regression, the coefficient for partnered women with young children (the “young child” line) is -0.89. Thus, to get the predicted effect of having young children on the labor force participation of partnered women with young children, we multiply that coefficient by the actual LFP of partnered women with no children younger than 18, which is 70.1%. Thus, -0.89*0.701*(1-0.701)=-0.187, which means that our model predicts that having a young child will reduce partnered women’s probability of being in the labor force by 0.187, or 18.7% compared to partnered women with no children, all other factors being equal.
Empirically, the partnered women with young children have a LFP rate 8.6% lower than partnered women with no children, but that’s because in reality all other factors are not equal: partnered women with young children have higher average education levels than partnered women with no children, thus increasing their probability of being in the labor force.

"The Senate confirmation vote on Richard Cordray this week won’t have much to do with Richard Cordray.
As I wrote when the Senate Banking Committee considered the Cordray nomination back in March, nobody disputes the idea that the former Ohio Attorney General who has led the CFPB since January 2012, is highly competent and supremely qualified to continue in his position. Nor is the impact of the agency itself in doubt: in 2012 alone, 6 million U.S. consumers received refunds from financial services companies as a result of CFPB enforcement actions, according Americans for Financial Reform, and the agency has handled more than 130,000 consumer complaints since it opened its doors less than two years ago.
Whether it’s protecting consumers from the type of reckless and deceptive mortgage lending that sparked the economic downturn or beginning to oversee the massive credit reporting companies that shape the financial lives of American consumers, the CFPB has proven itself to be a critical consumer watchdog.
But back in February 43 Republican Senators sent President Obama a letter asserting that they would refuse to permit a vote to consider any nominee to lead the CFPB unless the agency was restructured in ways that would significantly weaken it. This despite the fact that the agency’s creation and structure was determined by legislation passed by both chambers of Congress and signed into law by the president nearly three years ago. Since February, the GOP caucus hasn’t moved an inch. Last month, the House Financial Services Committee refused to allow Cordray to testify on behalf of the CFPB, as Chairman Jeb Hensarling insisted that he was not the legitimate director. The opposition is absurdly petty.
Polls show strong and broad public support for the CFPB and its mission. The vast majority of small business owners support the CFPB and many leaders of financial firms overseen by the agency appreciate the CFPB’s transparent procedures and the chance to operate in a marketplace with clear and predictable rules. But it’s making little impact in the face of Senate obstructionism.
The battle is yet another face of the broader Republican obstructionism  Robert Kuttner decried on this blog last week. “Obama's term still has more than three and a half years to run and Democrats still have a 55-45 majority in the Senate,” Kuttner noted, “but the Republicans are treating him like the lamest of lame ducks.”
To fight back, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is reportedly considering the “nuclear option” of filibuster reform if Cordray, along with President Obama’s nominees to head the Department of Labor and the Environmental Protection Agency, are blocked from receiving up-or-down votes on their appointment. President Obama’s slate of nominees to the National Labor Relations Board—which has not had a full Senate-confirmed, five-member board since August 2003—merit the same treatment.
Noting that even CFPB foes in the financial services industry are tired of the debate over Cordray, Politico nevertheless observes that “House Republicans have recently ramped up efforts to highlight their opposition to the bureau.”
It’s time to pull down the curtain on a show that’s putting even bank lobbyists to sleep: the Senate must confirm Cordray and give Americans the financial watchdog we need.",blog
"Just when we imagined that credit reporting firms couldn’t be more invasive and profiteering, NBC News breaks this story: 
The Equifax credit reporting agency, with the aid of thousands of human resource departments around the country, has assembled what may be the most powerful and thorough private database of Americans’ personal information ever created, containing 190 million employment and salary records covering more than one-third of U.S. adults.
Based on data voluntarily provided by thousands of U.S. businesses and public employers (from local public schools to federal agencies) Equifax’s product, The Work Number, includes information many of us would prefer to keep private, from week-by-week paystubs to information on personal “health care providers” – perhaps including the name of your psychiatrist or gynecologist.
For employers, The Work Number offers “an easy way to outsource employment verification of former workers” without having to deal with pesky phone calls whenever former employees start applying for new jobs. It’s a convenient service. But employers themselves may not know what the credit reporting giant does next:
Equifax turns around and sells some of this data to third parties, including debt collectors and financial services companies.
That’s right: debt collectors – the very companies that a new Federal Trade Commission study just found don’t bother to verify alleged debts in half of the cases studied – and yes, the same companies widely denounced for their harassing and abusive practices in pursuit of debts consumers may have paid off long ago or may never have owed – may now have access every detail of your employment history.
Yet even as Equifax and its debt collector customers cash in on data about the pay rates of millions of Americans, employees themselves can’t share information about their own paychecks so freely. According to the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, nearly half of U.S. employees are either contractually forbidden or strongly discouraged from discussing their own pay with their colleagues. Pay non-disclosure rules aimed at employees are a significant barrier to preventing gender and racial discrimination at work – as the ACLU points out “workers often remain in the dark about pay discrimination because employers have rules that punish employees for voluntarily sharing wage information with their colleagues.” For just that reason, Senator Barbara Mikulski has called on President Obama to issue an executive order prohibiting federal contractors from retaliating against employees who discuss salaries amongst themselves. Similarly, the National Labor Relations Board recently struck down provisions in Costco’s employee handbook  that barred employees from sharing personal salary information with coworkers. Unfortunately, this ruling was thrown into limbo when a court struck down President Obama’s recess appointments to the NLRB. 
The upshot? Even as employee advocates seek partial solutions to rules that bar workers from freely discussing their own salaries, Equifax insists that its collection and resale of personal salary information to third parties is perfectly legal under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. More than one law needs to be changed here.   ",blog
"In the midst of the worst economic downturn in decades, millions of Americans are out of work and struggling to keep up with bills for even the most basic expenses. What they need more than anything is a job. But for too many people, access to employment is blocked by the growing practice of employment credit checks. Employers in the public and private sectors now routinely check the credit histories of prospective employees and may use the information to deny them jobs.
Credit checks exclude qualified applicants – including people whose credit was damaged as a result of medical debt, divorce, layoffs, predatory lending, identity theft, or other events beyond their control – from the employment they desperately need. Credit checks also discriminate against low-income people and people of color, who have been disproportionately impacted by the economic downturn.
The campaign to end employment credit checks, which is widely supported by dozens of national civil rights organizations, is fundamentally about economic justice.  It’s about putting qualified people back to work and ensuring that all job seekers be given a fair shot at gainful employment.
Credit reports were developed as a tool for lenders to evaluate whether someone would be a good credit risk based on their past payment history. These reports detail whether someone has fallen behind on their bills, whether they have had to declare bankruptcy, and if they’ve faced foreclosure.  Research has raised concerns about the prevalence of errors in credit reports and the difficulties in getting incorrect information removed from a report.[1] Yet over the past few years, the credit reporting industry, which is dominated by three large multinational corporations, has reaped profits from selling this personal consumer information to employers. According to a poll by the Society for Human Resources Management, 60 percent of employers now conduct employment credit checks for some or all positions when they are hiring.[2]
Credit reports are marketed to employers as a means to gauge an applicant’s character or likelihood to commit theft or fraud. Yet no empirical evidence has demonstrated a correlation between personal credit reports and propensity to commit a crime. In fact, one study recently featured in the New York Times found no such correlation.[3] A spokesperson for TransUnion, one of the major credit reporting companies, even admitted: “we don’t have any research to show any statistical correlation between what’s in somebody’s credit report… and their likelihood to commit fraud.”[4] Credit reports can be a good indicator of the tremendous economic stresses that are facing households, including whether they have had to incur debts to pay for basic expenses or medical care, but they are not a crystal ball revealing who will be a reliable employee.
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has repeatedly warned that employment credit checks have a discriminatory impact on African American and Latino applicants, whose credit histories have suffered from discrimination in lending, housing and employment itself.[5] Studies from the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Trade Commission and others have consistently that found that average credit scores of African Americans are lower than those of whites.[6] In addition, credit continues to be offered on discriminatory terms: in the last decade predatory lending schemes targeting communities of color compounded historic disparities in wealth and assets, leaving African-Americans, Latinos, and other people of color at greater risk of foreclosure and default on loans. Employment credit checks can perpetuate and amplify this injustice, translating a legacy of unfair lending into another subtle means of employment discrimination. Numerous civil rights organizations including the NAACP, the National Council of La Raza, and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, have publicly opposed the use of employment credit checks. The EEOC has sued two employers over its use of credit reports as a hiring tool, demonstrating that credit reports may introduce legal liability to employers.
Americans should not have to expose a painful divorce or past medical condition just to get a job. Yet because family break-up and medical problems are among the leading reasons that Americans become unable to pay their debts, these deeply personal concerns are often revealed in an employment credit check, particularly if an applicant is asked to “explain” an imperfect credit history.  Medical confidentiality and long-standing protections against disability discrimination may fall by the wayside when a prospective employer scrutinizes a job applicant’s personal credit history.
Political leaders are waking up to the need to remove this unfair barrier to employment. Seven states – Washington, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, California, Maryland and Oregon – have recently passed laws restricting the use of credit reports in employment. More than twenty additional states considered legislation on employment credit checks in 2011. The city of Hartford, Connecticut has also acted to end the use of credit checks for its own municipal hiring. A federal bill, the Equal Employment for All Act, is currently pending before the U.S. Congress. Yet much work remains to be done. Today, too many Americans are trapped in an untenable Catch-22: they are unable to secure a job because of damaged credit and unable to escape debt and improve their credit because they cannot find work. At a time when so many are confronting economic hardship, we must act to lower barriers to employment and give people the opportunity to work their way out of debt.

"...while fast food may be an extreme case, it is hardly the only industry – in New York or nationwide – where front-line workers are underpaid and inequality is metastasizing. In fact, our economy is increasingly built on job growth in the most unequal industries: a trend that concentrates more and more income at the top and makes it even more difficult for working people to share in the benefits of economic growth.
That’s why the push to raise wages won’t stop with fast food –or with New York.

"How Our Tax Dollars Are Funding Low-Wage Work and Fueling Inequality
Every day, Americans benefit from public structures that contribute to our quality of life. When we walk into a clean, well-maintained post office; drive on federal highways; send our kids to school knowing they’ll get a hot lunch; or call the Social Security benefits office with a question, we see our federal tax dollars at work, providing public services we rely on.
Download the full report to read more
What most Americans don’t know is that many of the workers keeping our nation humming are paid low wages, earning barely enough to afford essentials like food, health care, utilities and rent. Through federal contracts and other funding, our tax dollars are fueling the low-wage economy and exacerbating inequality. Hundreds of billions of dollars in federal contracts, grants, loans, concession agreements and property leases go to private companies that pay low wages, provide few benefits, and offer employees little opportunity to work their way into the middle class. At the same time, many of these companies are providing their executives with exorbitant compensation.
We find that nearly two million private sector employees working on behalf of America earn wages too low to support a family, making $12 or less per hour. This is more than the number of low-wage workers at Walmart and McDonalds combined.1 Yet, if anything, this figure underestimates the total number of poorly-paid workers funded by our tax dollars. Our analysis encompasses U.S. workers employed by government contractors, paid by federal health care spending, supported by Small Business Administration loans, working on federal construction grants, and maintaining buildings leased by the federal government. This encompasses the largest share of poorly-paid workers funded by our taxes. However, other streams of funding have yet to be analyzed. For example, loans and subsidies from the Department of Agriculture fund giant agribusinesses that employ more than a million farm workers, while grants from the Department of Education fund low-wage assistant teachers, bus monitors and cooks in Head Start and other programs. Due to lack of data, retail and food service workers for concessionaires of the National Parks Service and other federal agencies also fall outside our analysis.
These are employees working on behalf of America, doing jobs that we have decided are worthy of public funding—yet they’re being treated in a very un-American way. Our nation has a history of ensuring our tax dollars provide decent jobs. From the 1931 Davis-Bacon Act to Executive Order 11246 of 1965, and a host of other laws and executive actions, our laws have mandated that companies working on behalf of the American people are upholding high standards of employment practices. Yet as the nature and prevalence of federal contracting, lending and grant-making have changed, and some laws have been weakened, working people have fallen through the cracks.
When our tax dollars underwrite bad jobs, the economy as a whole is weakened and all of us are negatively affected. There is a ripple effect as low-paid workers and their families have little money to spend, hindering economic growth that could be creating more jobs. Poorly-paid workers also contribute less in taxes and are more likely to rely on public benefits to care for their families. In contrast, we would all benefit from an economy where workers earn good wages—and we have a special responsibility to see that the people working on behalf of our nation are paid and treated fairly. Raising standards for people working on behalf of America is one important piece to providing opportunities for workers to reach the middle class.
In his 2013 State of the Union Address, President Obama acknowledged the key role that middle-class jobs play in our economy, announcing that “it is our generation’s task to reignite the true engine of America’s economic growth—a rising, thriving middle class.” President Obama outlined a powerful policy vision to strengthen the middle class and jumpstart the economy, from raising the minimum wage to making high-quality preschool accessible to all Americans. Yet these proposals will require Congressional approval. Legislative action would likely also be necessary to reach all of the 1.992 million low-wage private sector workers whose jobs are funded by the federal government. But through an executive order, President Obama has significant authority to improve many of the poorly-paid workers whose work is paid for with our tax dollars.
At a time of budget cuts and austerity, lifting and broadening standards for employees working on behalf of America would not necessarily mean a significant increase in the tab for taxpayers. Evidence on the impact of local living wage laws and economic development agreements that incorporate job standards indicates that the cost to taxpayers does not rise dramatically when workers are paid decent wages.2 In addition, companies that raise wages benefit from productivity gains and reduced employee turnover. By raising wages for these workers, there will also be public savings due to the reduction in demand for public benefits like food stamps. Finally, high salaries of executives at contracting firms suggest that there are substantial funds that could be better allocated. In many cases, raising wage standards for workers may not require any additional taxpayer dollars.
Today, we have an opportunity to do right by workers who are working on behalf of America by ensuring our tax dollars are providing decent and fair wages. This report provides an analysis of the current composition of poorly-paid workers whose jobs are funded with our tax dollars. These workers represent a large spectrum of occupations, from workers sewing military uniforms to hospital aides funded by Medicare, security guards with contracts to protect public buildings, and food cart vendors at the National Zoo. We look at the role of taxpayer dollars in fueling the low-wage labor market and explore the disparity between low-wage workers and highly-paid CEOs in the Washington D.C. area, where a disproportionate percentage of contracting dollars are spent. Finally, we offer policy recommendations outlining an executive order that could raise standards for low-wage employees who are working on behalf of our country.

"When Walmart broke the bad news to shareholders last week about declining same-store sales and cuts to their profit and sales projections, the company offered a glib explanation. ""The retail environment was challenging,"" asserted Walmart Stores President and CEO Michael Duke. Company executives pointed to weather conditions and the January payroll tax increase to justify the disappointing sales, but larger questions about why consumers weren't buying were never addressed.
The unspoken reality is that America's low-income consumers have little money to spare. Average weekly earnings for all private-sector workers fell $3.09 in the last month. Yet Walmart itself, the nation's largest employer, could play a leading role in boosting consumer spending and bolstering the nation's slow economic recovery. Rather than lamenting the ""challenging"" and ""disappointing"" retail environment, Walmart could boldly move to reshape it.
The key step? Raising the company's notoriously low wages.
Substantially increasing pay for front-line workers would be an unexpected step for a company known for its laser-like focus on reducing operating costs. Yet by putting more money into the pockets of more than a million low-paid Walmart employees in the U.S., a raise would increase the buying power of the people most likely to spend their additional funds immediately -- and more likely than not, to spend it in Walmart's own stores.
When my organization, Demos, analyzed the retail industry last year, we projected the economic impact if all retailers employing 1,000 workers or more were to raise wages for their full-time, year-round employees to at least $25,000 a year. An annual income of $25,000 isn't much, but that wage is still higher than the $21,000 a typical retail sales person earned in 2012, and is far more than the $15,500 that analysts calculate the average Walmart associate earns annually.
A raise of that magnitude, we forecast, would increase GDP between $11.8 and $15.2 billion over the next year and would create 100,000 or more net new jobs. What's more, the increased purchasing power of low-wage employees would generate $4 to $5 billion additional annual sales for the retail sector itself. The additional payroll costs would represent just a small fraction of total sales, and the potential cost to consumers would be only a few cents more per shopping trip. If Walmart specifically were to raise its wages to $12 an hour, the average Walmart shopper would pay just $12.49 more in an entire year even if the company passed 100 percent of its costs on to shoppers, according to a separate analysis by the University of California Berkeley Labor Center.",media
"Demos welcomes the opportunity to submit comments to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Notice and Request for Comment concerning the Bureau’s definition of larger consumer reporting agencies (CRAs) that will be subject to the CFPB’s supervision.
We strongly support supervision of the “big three” consumer reporting agencies and other CRAs encompassed by the CFPB’s proposed threshold of $7 million in receipts. However, to effectively protect consumers from financial abuses, the CFPB should expand its definition of larger participants in the consumer reporting market.
We urge the CFPB to adopt a flexible, broad standard that can respond to changes in the marketplace and ensure that risky actors do not evade supervision. In particular, the CFPB should:
In defining the scope of its supervisory power, the CFPB has a unique opportunity to protect consumers and ensure a fair marketplace. This is particularly critical in the consumer reporting industry, where firms have not previously been subject to supervision or scrutiny. Indeed, consumer reporting can be seen as an exemplar of the rapidly changing consumer marketplace: credit reports and scores that were initially developed to evaluate the risks of lending to a particular consumer have been adapted for use in a wide range of other consumer contexts in which their predictive value is dubious or unclear. Landlords, insurance companies, public utilities, and even employers now use credit reports for decision-making with significant impacts on consumers’ economic well-being.
At the same time nationwide specialty credit reporting companies are promoting a variety of consumer records, including information of dubious relevance such as gym membership and magazine subscription data, for lending and non-lending financial purposes with substantial potential impacts on consumers. A broad and flexible definition of supervisory power along the lines we recommend would ensure that consumers are shielded from a range of abusive practices by the credit reporting industry.
Dēmos appreciates the opportunity to comment on the rule defining larger non-bank participants.

"Here’s how it’s supposed to work at the nation’s ports these days: the predominantly immigrant workers who drive short-haul trucks as “independent contractors” work in a desperate race to the bottom of pay, safety, and working conditions. Although trucking companies control things like the rate of pay and the times and conditions when truckers may work, their drivers are classified as “self-employed” so they don’t band together to demand better pay or safer working conditions, and they certainly don’t go on strike.
Except when they do.

Trucks hauling cargo from the Port of Seattle
The Port of Seattle has been shut down for more than a week. And it is the so-called independent contractor drivers who have stood together to stop the flow of goods. In doing so, the drivers are taking a powerful stand against the deregulated model of port trucking that takes a toll, not only on their own livelihoods and safety but on the environment and public as well.  
On January 30, some Seattle port truckers missed a day’s pay to go to the state capitol and testify on legislation that would enhance safety on the job  and end their misclassification as independent contractors. When one trucking company retaliated against a driver, an Ethiopian immigrant known as Yared, for speaking out, other drivers stopped their vehicles in solidarity. Eleven days later, the stoppage continues to spread.
As Professor David Bensman noted in a Demos study of the port trucking industry, misclassifying workers as independent contractors has numerous benefits for less-than-scrupulous employers: they can skip out on payroll taxes and workers’ compensation and forget about minimum wages and overtime pay. The companies that employ supposedly “independent” truck drivers can even disregard expenses associated with truck ownership and maintenance, putting the costs on the drivers who may net close to the minimum wage and passing on the savings to the multinational companies, like Wal-Mart and Target, that move their goods through the ports.  And, of course, if workers aren’t officially recognized as employees, they can’t legally form a union to bargain for better pay and conditions.
As we’ve seen over the past few days, though, blocking the right to unionize can’t guarantee labor peace forever. As a blogger for the Coalition for Clean and Safe Ports notes:
During the Occupy Wall Street port shutdowns, activists and well-intentioned sympathizers debated whether the blockades would siphon wages from port workers – arguably one of the greatest symbols of the 99% — or if it would suck profits from the 1%, such as the Seattle-based global terminal operator, Goldman Sachs’ SSA Marine, and its West Coast trucking outfit, Shipper’s Transport Express. What their protest proves is that port drivers, as inside agitators, are very much willing to lose pay as a means to powerfully reveal the crushing economic forces that literally put their lives and livelihoods at risk. Even, and especially amidst a severe economic downturn. Their historical ability to self organize, unite, and seize opportunities to improve their working conditions is unfolding before our eyes.",blog
"Black History Month is about gratitude. I am grateful because time and again black people’s struggle for freedom advanced liberation for everyone in the United States—and is still advancing it today.
The women’s rights movement of the 19th century emerged from abolitionism. Black and white women agitating for an end to slavery gained skills in organizing and advocacy, fighting to make their own voices heard as campaigners for abolition and ultimately for women’s suffrage. Women’s rights moved forward even as black women activists and leaders, like Ida B. Wells, were increasingly marginalized within the suffrage movement they worked to build.
On the level of ideas and imagination, the successful battle against slavery also showed that seemingly eternal and immutable facts of the social order can—and must—be changed.
In the decades since, the gains of the Civil Rights Movement broadened opportunities for all people of color and spurred independent organizing by Native American, Puerto Rican and Mexican-American activists who drew on the tactics and insights of African American civil rights and Black Power organizations. Americans fighting for workers’ rights, environmental sustainability, disability rights, LGBTQ rights, and feminism similarly benefitted from and built on the example of the civil rights struggle. Black activists contributed to all of these movements.
African Americans’ push for social inclusion broke down barriers for all of us. Today, movements like Black Lives Matter, the Poor People’s Campaign, and voting rights campaigns like the triumphant Florida Rights Restoration Coalition and Stacey Abrams’ new Fair Fight Action continue to move us forward.
I talk to my children about how they—who have ethnic roots in Ireland, China, Samoa, Germany, Switzerland, and the Jewish communities of Eastern Europe, but as far as we know, no African ancestry—are beneficiaries of the struggles of black history. And how we have an obligation to stand in solidarity and support for the fights of our own time.
 
Since 1976, the United States has designated February as Black History Month to honor the often overlooked achievements of black Americans throughout the country’s history. Demos is honoring Black History Month by highlighting reflections from some of our staff. We welcome you to join the conversation by sharing your thoughts with us on social media using #blackhistorymonth.

"What does it take to change the business model of a multinational corporation that brings in nearly half a trillion dollars in revenue each year?  You’d have to ask Walmart workers.
In the last week alone, workers organizing with OUR Walmart claimed victory on two major fronts, shifting the company’s policies to ensure basic respect for pregnant employees and to improve scheduling for all hourly employees, giving them more opportunities to get the work hours they need to meet basic expenses.  
Both moves were preceded by years of agitation by Walmart employees and their allies, from the strikes that shook Walmart stores throughout the country on Black Friday 2012 and 2013 demanding better pay and more hours to the petitions, shareholder resolution, pregnancy discrimination case with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a host of other actions by Walmart employees and their allies to change the company’s unfair policies.
For its part, Walmart asserts it succumbed to no pressure from outside the corporate boardroom. Changing policy toward workers with difficult pregnancies was simply “the right thing to do for our associates,” a Walmart spokesperson told Bloomberg Businessweek.  And it would be “inaccurate” to describe the move to make work hours more accessible to part-time employees a response to workers’ protests, another Walmart spokesperson informed Huffington Post.
In that case, Walmart workers might as well pipe down now. If their past actions had no impact on the company’s decisions, there’s no point in continuing to call for more full-time work opportunities, further scheduling improvements, fairness for pregnant workers who haven’t suffered disabilities but need accommodation to stay healthy, or a fair wage of at least $25,000 a year for full-time work. It’s certainly not worth noting, as I did last week, that taxpayers subsidize Walmart’s tremendous profits by enabling it to pay so little that many of its workers qualify for food stamps. Everyone should just keep their head down and get back to the job. That’s certainly what Walmart would prefer.
The good news is, it’s not going to happen. Emboldened by their victories on pregnancy discrimination and scheduling issues, Walmart employees are likely to work harder than ever to move the nation’s largest employer on critical concerns like pay and advancement. 
Another case in point: last month, McDonald’s admitted that strike actions by its workers and their allies might ultimately force it to raise wages.  Walmart is making no such admission. But in its case, actions speak far louder than words.",blog
"I’m writing this post from a hospital bed. And I’m really lucky to be doing it.
Of course, I’m not thrilled about the complications of pregnancy that have confined me to bed rest for several weeks. But because of a job I can do remotely with a cell phone and laptop—and most importantly, a progressive employer committed to embodying its values—I can afford to take time to get the care I need now and receive time off with my baby when he’s born. Most Americans aren’t so fortunate.
That’s why President Obama’s announcement that he is directing federal agencies to provide employees with six weeks of paid leave following the birth or adoption of a child is much needed. His call for Congress to guarantee workers’ access to paid sick days and to start a fund that would help states establish paid family leave insurance programs is even more necessary.
The president’s actions highlight our country’s enormous deficiency when it comes to paid family leave. Virtually every other country already guarantees it. Out of 185 countries, the United States is one of just three—in the company of Oman and Papua New Guinea—that doesn’t guarantee at least some paid leave to new mothers. Many nations guarantee 14 weeks, 26 weeks, or more and guarantee leave to fathers as well.
Yet according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, just 13 percent of workers in the U.S. had access to paid family leave through their employers in 2014. Three states—California, New Jersey, and Rhode Island—currently guarantee workers access to leave paid for through state insurance funds. And the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA), passed in 1993, grants employees who work for larger employers the right to take 12 weeks of unpaid leave to care for themselves, a new baby, or a family member with a serious illness. Since its passage, the FMLA has been used 100 million times by working people to take time off work during their period of greatest need, without having to worry about losing their jobs or their health insurance.
But the FMLA doesn’t protect everyone. And too many Americans, especially those living paycheck to paycheck, can’t afford to take unpaid time off. When a baby is born or we are diagnosed with cancer or another long-term illness, Americans need paid leave. All of us.
As Demos fellow Sharon Lerner pointed out on this blog last year, we already know that paid leave is good for families.
In California, where paid family and medical leave has been in effect for 10 years, the law has increased fathers’ involvement of the care of their babies. In Europe, where many countries provide upwards of six months of leave, increased paid leave has not just improved children’s health but also, according to a 2000 study in the Journal of Health Economics, saved lives.
Lerner’s recent research finds that establishing paid family leave in New Jersey had minimal effect on employers, certainly not sparking the mass layoffs, staggering business costs, or human resources chaos some opponents had predicted.
Yet despite the clear benefits and low costs of paid leave, I’m still part of a fortunate minority: Americans with the opportunity to take paid time off to recover from illness and bond with my newborn when he arrives.
It’s tremendously encouraging to see President Obama leading the effort to change that picture. And there’s more that he can do. In addition to the important step of guaranteeing paid leave for federal employees, the president can continue using his executive authority to raise standards for the private sector employees who work for federal contractors.
Demos has called on the president to sign a Good Jobs Executive Order that would promote federal purchasing standards with preferences for companies that offer key benefits like paid family leave and paid sick days. But it will take Congress to truly move us all forward. ",blog
"This is shaping up to be a truly miserable week in Washington. Decisions made in the halls of Congress and the chambers of the Supreme Court are dramatically shifting power away from working Americans and toward bosses and banks. To anyone paying attention, it’s clearer than ever who benefits from Trump’s vision of American “greatness.” 
On Monday, the Supreme Court released its decision in Epic Systems v. Lewis, ruling 5-4 that employers who steal wages, harass employees, or discriminate on the job can block workers from banding together to pursue justice in the courts. As a result of the ruling, corporations can force workers to sign arbitration clauses that eliminate their right to bring collective legal action. At a company’s discretion, workers who refuse to sign an arbitration agreement can be fired or never hired in the first place. Without the threat of lawsuits, working people have little power to hold their employers accountable for breaking the law. Corporations are freed to violate fundamental workplace protections—from minimum wage laws, to workplace safety protections, to fair employment rules—with near impunity. Laws that cannot be enforced might as well not exist.
As commentators have noted, the ruling is a major blow to the #MeToo movement, as women facing systemic sexual discrimination or harassment will lose the ability to band together to fight their mistreatment in court. Workers of color, who confront pervasive workplace discrimination and face a higher rate of employment violations, will also be hit hard. By pushing workers into individual arbitration processes that favor the employer, lawbreaking corporations can powerfully shield themselves from accountability.
The 5 to 4 decision in Epic Systems was possible only because of the Republican-controlled Senate’s unprecedented refusal to hold hearings on President Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, opening the door for Trump to appoint Justice Gorsuch and cement an anti-worker majority on the court.
While working people will have less power, banks are about to get much more. On Tuesday, the House of Representatives voted 258-159 to approve S. 2155, a bill known as “the bank lobbyist act” because it enacts a big piece of the finance industry’s wish list. By rolling back key elements of the Dodd-Frank Act, the legislation removes public oversight and consumer protection put into place after banks’ reckless lending crashed the U.S. economy in 2008. The bill reduces oversight on 25 of the largest 38 banks in the United States, increasing risks of another financial crisis and public bailout by loosening rules on some of the same banks whose risky bets led to the Great Recession.
The bill also weakens protections against fraud and predatory lending for consumers seeking mortgages, leaving rural homebuyers and people purchasing manufactured homes particularly vulnerable to abuses. In addition, S. 2155 exempts the vast majority of banks from reporting home mortgage data that would help to detect and fight widespread and ongoing racial discrimination in mortgage lending. For more on the bill, see Demos’ letter of opposition.
Unfortunately, the banking industry wish list has bipartisan appeal: the bill passed the House with the support of 225 Republicans and 33 Democrats, while 50 Republicans and 16 Democrats approved the bill in the Senate. Trump is reportedly eager to sign the legislation and enthusiastic about Democrats signing on to his vision for a country where banks have less oversight and more freedom to cheat and discriminate against consumers.
Hope, as always, lies with the demos—the American people. If working people of all races turn out to vote and to engage in the civic life of their communities and our nation, as some recent primary results suggest they are doing in greater numbers, we can elect representatives who will reverse the anti-worker and anti-consumer tides sweeping through Washington. Demos’ new briefing book Everyone’s Economy lays out a policy roadmap that includes ending the type of forced arbitration that the Supreme Court has just blessed as well as strengthening consumer protections and anti-discrimination laws. With a week like this, it should be easier than ever to contrast an authentic, multi-racial populism against the phony populism wealthy elites are using to divide working people today.

"Employment credit checks illegitimately obstruct access to employment, keeping qualified workers out of jobs they need. It’s an argument Demos has been making for a few years, but the new study we released this week provides additional data to back it up.
Drawing on the findings of our most recent National Survey on Credit Card Debt of Low-and Middle-Income Households, we find that – at least among our survey population of low- and middle-income households carrying credit card debt – employment credit checks are common; people are denied jobs because of their credit; and poor credit is associated with factors most of us wouldn’t consider relevant to how well someone would perform at a new job, including past unemployment by someone in their household, lack of health coverage for someone in their household, and medical debt. Our findings also correspond to past studies which find that people of color are disproportionately likely to report poor credit  and that a not-inconsequential minority of households have serious errors in their credit reports.
The conclusion? With possible exceptions for the kind of national security positions where your childhood friends are interviewed, old diaries are read, bank statements are examined, and travel records are scrutinized, employers should be prohibited from using personal credit history as part of the hiring process. It’s discriminatory, irrelevant, and traps jobs seekers in a nasty catch-22. Employment credit checks should be outlawed. Congressman Steve Cohen’s bill to restrict the practice would be a great start.
Of course, the credit reporting industry – including the Big Three firms Experian, Transunion and Equifax, that collect credit information and develop credit reports and the host of smaller background check companies that aggressively sell credit reports and other information to employers – has an interest in continuing to profit off the sale of credit information to employers. The Big Three have an even greater interest in making the case that personal credit history is relevant to just about every action or transaction Americans undertake in life (from dating to  hospital admissions) since credit reporting “mission creep” helps them sell more products.
So what might the credit reporting industry say in response to our research? Huffington Post reporter Saki Knafo asked the Consumer Data Industry Association – the lobbying arm of the credit reporting industry – for their take:
Norm Magnuson, a spokesman for the Consumer Data Industry Association, questioned the reliability of Demos' information. ""Employers don't necessarily tell people we're not hiring you because of bad debts,"" he said. ""There are a lot of reasons they might not hire you.""
What’s startling about Magnuson’s reply is that the main federal law governing the use of credit reports, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, in fact requires employers to notify job applicants if their credit played any role in the decision not to hire them. The reality is that the law is almost impossible to enforce, and many employers likely do not comply with their legal obligation to inform job applicants. Still, it’s something else to see a spokesman for the industry blithely admit that his product is frequently used in ways that violate the law.
It’s a powerful sign that the laws meant to protect consumers and job seekers from the misuse of credit information are inadequate. We should ban employment credit checks. But a wider reevaluation of the credit reporting industry is also in order.",blog
"When it comes to jobs, the fast food industry represents the worst of our economy: paying poverty wages; offering irregular, part-time hours; and providing few benefits. Wage theft and workplace safety hazards are rampant. An executive who has built his personal wealth on a fast food business model that treats working people as cheap and disposable is among the worst possible choices to lead the Department of Labor. Yet Donald Trump has selected fast food CEO Andrew Puzder for the responsibility of protecting American workers.
Mr. Puzder’s company, fast food chain CKE Restaurants, Inc. - which includes Hardees and Carl’s Jr. - is a serial violator of the very workplace laws that the Department of Labor is responsible for enforcing. Since Puzder assumed control in 2000, CKE and its franchisees have been charged with 98 safety violations under state and federal law, including 36 serious violations. This includes incidents where workers who were not provided proper safety equipment or training were hospitalized with severe burns. 
Puzder’s company has also violated the Fair Labor Standards Act at more than half of Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr. restaurants, failing to pay workers the minimum wage and overtime. And under Puzder’s leadership CKE has also been sued for sexual harassment and discrimination in hiring, including violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act and state human rights laws.
Dēmos’ research finds that fast food is one of the most unequal industries in the United States with regards to pay. In 2012, fast food CEOs, who are among the highest paid individuals in today’s workforce, took home more than 1,200 times the paycheck of the average fast food worker. Today’s average fast food employee only makes $9.09 an hour. Even at 40 hours a week, this hourly rate leaves many fast food workers living below the federal poverty line.
Puzder and others have defended these poor working conditions by arguing that these are meant to be entry level jobs for teenagers looking to gain work experience. Yet today’s fast food workforce no longer matches this picture: recent data from the Census Bureau show that two-thirds of the industry’s workforce is aged 20 or older, and more than 20 percent of fast food workers are raising children, struggling to support them on fluctuating schedules and poverty wages.
And while Puzder’s law-breaking record should immediately disqualify him from serving as Secretary of Labor, it should give all working people reason to worry. 
Today a growing percentage of U.S. employment has come to resemble fast food jobs: a quarter of the nation’s working households depending on the pay of low-wage workers including Americans working in the retail, home health care, and food service industries. On its current path, the economy is set to generate more of the same: analysis of U.S. Department of Labor statistics reveals that 28 percent of the new jobs being created over the next decade will be in occupations paying median hourly wages below $12 an hour.
Only smart employment policies and strong enforcement by the Department of Labor can change the trend toward an economy based on low paying fast food-style jobs. The modernized overtime pay rule put forth by President Obama would boost incomes for 12.5 million salaried workers including managers in fast food restaurants and retail outlets. Raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour would lift millions more working households out of poverty. Strengthening the ability of working people to join together in unions could help transform service sector jobs just as unions raised standards for dirty, dangerous and low-paying manufacturing and mining jobs in the last century. Yet Andrew Puzder has ties to anti-union groups and has spoken out against the minimum wage and overtime, insisting that “a national minimum wage would be ineffective,” and that the overtime rule would “be another barrier to the middle class rather than a springboard.”
The Fight for 15 movement began in 2012 when hundreds of fast food workers in New York City walked off the job calling for a $15 wage and the right to form a union. In the years following, they were joined by child care workers, retail associates, airport employees, adjunct university faculty and a wide range of other working people pushing back against fast food-style wages and jobs seeping into many corners of the U.S. economy. 
We need vigorous enforcement of labor and employment laws to turn back the tide transforming a growing portion of U.S. jobs into low-paying, disrespected employment. As Secretary of Labor, law-breaker Andrew Puzder would put us on an express train in the wrong direction. Senators who care about working people and the quality of American jobs must vote against confirming him.

"“I can afford to get ripped off,” Stephen Colbert informed Demos’ Tammy Draut back in May 2009 “I think it’s the poor people who can’t afford to get ripped off who are ruining this for everybody.”
The joke hit the mark, but Comedy Central’s satirical pundit had it backward, Tammy quickly noted. It was low- and middle-income consumers paying high penalties and fees who were subsidizing his credit card perks. That’s why the nation needed regulation to rein in the abusive practices of “an entire industry is built on gotcha tactics – designed to keep people in debt at a very high cost.” Within weeks, President Obama signed the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure (CARD) Act into law, ending many of the tricks and traps used by credit card issuers.
The law was enacted three years ago today, and new Demos research finds that it’s working as intended to save households money.
We find that the Credit CARD Act is helping households pay down balances faster, with a third of low- and middle-income households that carry credit card debt reporting that new disclosures have caused them to pay down their balances faster. The Act is also helping households avoid excessive fees and interest rate hikes: the percentage of surveyed households paying late fees plummeted from 53 percent in our 2008 study to just 28 percent today. The proportion seeing an interest rate hike as a result of late payments also fell.
The conclusion? Credit cards are a better, fairer financial product for American consumers as a result of the CARD Act. And while Colbert’s income bracket wasn’t part of our sample of low- and middle-income households, the law’s ban on abusive practices likely keeps him from getting ripped off as well.
There, however, a drawback: Demos' new report, “The Plastic Safety Net” also finds that consumer protections alone can’t remedy the deeper problems of lagging wages, high unemployment, and a fraying public safety net that are causing low- and middle-income Americans to rely on their credit cards to make ends meet and cope with emergencies. But we’ll explore those findings in a future post: for today, it’s Happy Birthday Credit CARD Act! It’s good to have something to celebrate.

"The manufacturing sector once offered a large supply of stable, middle-class jobs to American workers. Yet middle-income manufacturing jobs have been disappearing from the United States for the past 30 years. While technological innovation has played a much-recognized role in the erosion of the nation’s manufacturing base, policy failures also contributed to the disappearance of industrial jobs. Leveling the playing field for domestic manufacturing will ensure that the U.S. can compete on a global scale for the decent-paying jobs that will help to support the next generation of middle-class Americans.
From 1980 to 2005, low-skill jobs and high-skill jobs alike grew by nearly 30 percent, while the share of employment represented by middle-skill, middle-wage jobs dropped by nearly 12 percent.1 To put this story another way, the U.S. labor market has changed qualitatively over the last 30 years, marking a virtual disappearance of the jobs in sales, office administration, production, and operations that built the middle class in the mid-20th century. In exchange, there has been a rapid rise in low-skill positions in protective services, personal care, and maintenance, along with a spike in the employment of high-skill managerial and professional positions. As the labor market has polarized in this manner, the middle class has shrunk considerably.
There are two sets of possible responses to the disappearance of middle-skill, middle-wage jobs. First, as we have already stated, it is crucial to improve the pay and benefits offered for low-skill jobs: to this end, we call for raising the minimum wage and strengthening the power of Americans to collectively bargain for higher wages by forming a union. At the same time, we have called for aggressive investment in job training and human development more broadly, which will ensure that every American who works hard and plays by the rules will have the chance to develop the skills required for higher-paying positions.
But these interventions will not, by themselves, protect Americans from the economic vulnerability created by exposure to cheap overseas products. While many economists hold to the traditional theory that increased trade invariably generates greater gains across the board, recent analyses reveal a much different picture – indeed, according to David Autor of MIT, between one-third and two-thirds of the gains from international trade are wiped out by the subsequent increase in unemployment, wage depression, and hikes in public safety net payments.2 The facts could not be clearer: a $1,000 per worker increase in import exposure in a single locality results in a 0.77 percent reduction in the employment to population ratio (about three quarters of which is due to losses in manufacturing). This shock, moreover, is absorbed disproportionately by lower-skill workers, whose employment to population ratio actually declines by 1.1 percent, while that of higher-skill workers declines by 0.42 percent.
Given the subsequent rise in payments of disability and Social Security in localities exposed to imports from overseas, it is crucial to sustain not only Trade Adjustment Assistance for workers affected by overseas imports (manufacturing and service sectors alike) but also ensure that unemployment insurance and SNAP benefits remain available for the long-term jobless.3 These safety net programs have a proven record of preventing middle class families affected by international trade, and economic dislocation more generally, from sliding into poverty.4
Strengthen Buy American rules based on the “Invest in American Jobs Act of 2011” (H.R. 3533).8
End wasteful tax breaks that encourage offshoring.9
Affirm Trade Adjustment Assistance, Unemployment Insurance, and SNAP Benefits for Workers Affected by Exposure to International Trade.
While it is important to strengthen the safety net for Americans harmed by imports from low-wage countries, it is also possible to work more proactively to limit the damage caused by international trade. The most logical step here is to level the playing field for domestic manufacturing. Despite the odds, the American manufacturing sector has experienced a modest rebound as of late: over the past two years, as many as 330,000 manufacturing jobs have been created in the United States. Of course, this comes after 7.5 million manufacturing positions have been lost over the last 30 years, but there is reason to believe that smart policy can strengthen domestic industry and offer the middle class new options for middle-skill, middle-wage jobs.5
The U.S. tax code offers tax breaks that do not serve the interests of working Americans, allowing companies to deduct from their taxable income the cost of moving operations overseas – this, along with tax loopholes that allow U.S. companies to shelter profits overseas from intangible property such as patents, make it unnecessarily difficult for domestic manufacturing to thrive. Eliminating tax exemptions for U.S. companies to shelter profits on intangible property overseas would alone save the U.S. $23 billion and would also ensure that companies do not incur wasteful costs for choosing to remain at home and employ American workers.
Lastly, the U.S. government has the opportunity to take the lead by encouraging consumers to purchase domestic products by strengthening already existing Buy American laws and by toughening reporting requirements to ensure that public tax dollars are spent on American-made goods, where possible. A fully-robust Buy America provision would increase manufacturing jobs by as much as 33 percent;6 moreover, recent polling reveals that fully 91 percent of voters support restrictions on public taxpayer dollars being spent strictly on domestic-produced goods – indeed, 89 percent of self-identified Tea Party members support this provision along with 94 percent of Democrats.7
In order to rebuild the American middle class, it will be necessary to create the conditions for middle-skill, middle-wage jobs to thrive again – this can be achieved in part by leveling the playing field for the domestic manufacturing industry that once provided these jobs in abundance.

"Provide 12 weeks of paid benefits to employees who need time off work to care for a new child, a sick family member, or their own illness. The self-financing trust is funded by premiums paid equally by employers and employees.
In today’s economy, families increasingly depend on the incomes of all adults in the household, yet many working people also have responsibilities as parents and caregivers. Public policy has not kept up with the changing workforce: without access to paid leave, employees who need flexibility in their work lives to recover from illness or care for family members often face economic hardship. Family leave insurance addresses the reality of people’s lives as they strive to work their way into the middle class.
While still the typical primary caregiver, the number of women in the American workforce has expanded dramatically in the past decades: today nearly two-thirds of American families with children – including both married couples and single parents – have all adults in the workforce.1 At the same time, one in five American adults reports having caregiving responsibilities for another adult, such as a disabled or elderly relative, and most of these caregivers are employed.2 The proportion of the workforce with caring for elderly loved ones will continue to grow as the U.S. population ages. 
Uncompensated caregiving responsibilities have very real economic consequences for working Americans. For example, an adult caring for his or her aging parent stands to lose as much as $303,880 cumulatively in lost wages, Social Security, and pension benefits due to leaving the labor force early and/or working reduced hours because of caregiving responsibilities, according to one recent estimate.3 Yet it  is low-income workers who are least likely to have access to any form of paid leave. Low-wage workers often hold jobs with rigid or unpredictable schedules that further exacerbate conflicts between work and family responsibilities.4 Faced with the need to cope with a family illness or the birth of child, many workers see no option other than to quit or take time off they know will result in being fired from their job.5
The Family and Medical Leave Act, passed in 1993, was intended to provide some security to families facing a sudden illness, providing family care, or welcoming a new child. The law guarantees 12 weeks of unpaid leave to Americans working at businesses with 50 or more employees. Employers cannot replace workers on FMLA leave or retaliate against them in any way. Since its implementation, workers have used FMLA leave more than 100 million times.6 But four in ten American workers are not eligible because they work for smaller companies or have not been on the job long enough, and millions of Americans cannot afford to take leave without pay.7 Because only a small proportion of employees receive paid leave benefits directly from their employers, working Americans are still forced to risk their incomes and jobs to maintain their families.8 Employees of small companies lack any federal protection whatsoever.
The U.S. policy of offering only unpaid leave to deal with major life events stands in sharp contrast to the rest of the world. For example, 169 countries guarantee some form of paid leave to new parents – the U.S. joins Liberia, Papua New Guinea, and Swaziland on the short list of nations that leave workers alone to cope with this life-changing event and fail to mandate that employers provide paid time off when a child is born.9 In contrast, Canada, which has fairly typical policies for a developed economy, provides up to 51 weeks of partially paid leave for parents to spend with a new child.10 The new American Family Trust proposes a more modest standard for the United States: 12 weeks of partially paid leave to enable working families to provide needed care for loved ones without losing their jobs. This standard builds on successful paid leave programs already operating in states like California and New Jersey.
The American Family Trust would also have benefits for employers, especially small businesses that often have the greatest difficulty providing paid leave on their own. Enabling employees to address major life events like the arrival of a new baby or a spouse’s serious illness enables companies to recruit and retain the best employees and can improve workplace morale and productivity. It will also help employers save money in reduced turnover costs. For example, California’s modest six-week paid family leave program has improved retention among low-wage workers by ten percent.11 This represents no small savings given that turnover costs can amount to 25 to 200 percent of an employee’s annual compensation when recruiting, hiring, training, and other requirements are taken into account.12 Although business lobbyists were initially the most vehement opponents of California’s paid leave program, five years after its implementation nine out of ten employers reported no negative effect on business profitability or performance, with small businesses even less likely to detect any damaging impact on their bottom line.13
Finally, providing family leave insurance reflects Americans’ deep and widely shared values about the centrality and importance of family. Caring for children and sick loved ones is a concrete expression of that commitment. “You shouldn’t have to risk your job to take care of your family,” as advocates with the Multi-State Working Families Consortium put it, “and you shouldn’t have to put your family at risk just to do your job.”14 The American Family Trust, based closely on the Family Leave Insurance Act before the 111th Congress, will help to make that value a reality.15
The American Family Trust would provide 12 weeks of paid benefits to employees who need time off work to care for a new child, a sick family member, or their own illness. The self-financing trust is funded by premiums paid equally by employees and employers.

"The Denver Broncos had to consider a lot of things before they signed quarterback Tim Tebow: they undoubtedly scrutinized his college football record, studied his ability to throw long passes, and observed how he handled himself under pressure. But one thing that probably didn’t factor into the decision was Tebow’s credit history. The Broncos likely recognized that how Tebow managed his personal finances had nothing to do with his ability to play football.
Many other Colorado employers, however, do use credit history to screen prospective employees  – although research has not found it to be any more valid as a predictor of employee performance for other occupations than it is for football. And so, recognizing that employment credit checks form an unnecessary barrier to employment in her state, Colorado State Senator Morgan Carroll introduced the Employment Opportunity Act to curb their use. I had the privilege of testifying in favor of the bill this week in Denver.
I used no football analogies in my testimony. Here’s some of what I did say:
Over the past nine years, Demos has conducted extensive research on credit card debt among low- and moderate-income households. As part of this research, we have become increasingly concerned with how families are being financially penalized for being in debt, making it difficult, if not impossible, for them to ever get out of debt. The proliferation of the use of credit reports and scores in particular have resulted in families in debt being forced to pay more for basic services, such as water and gas, being denied a rental apartment, being charged more for auto or homeowners’ insurance, or, as I’ll discuss today in more detail, being denied a job – which is the very thing they need to get out of debt.
Credit checks are an unnecessary barrier to employment: by restricting their use, this legislation will help put people back to work and ensure that all job seekers have a fair shot at gainful employment.
Six out of ten American employers now look at a job applicant’s credit report when hiring for some or all positions. A brief, informal survey of job listings throughout the state of Colorado reveals that employers today are requiring credit checks for positions as diverse as maintenance work, telephone tech support, plumbing, work as a home care aide, and serving frozen yogurt.

"Sometimes in America, when low-paid workers stand up and speak out, even the President of the United States takes notice. This is one of those moments.
This morning, the White House announced that President Obama will sign a “Good Jobs” Executive Order requiring government contractors to raise the minimum wage for their lowest-paid workers to $10.10 for all new and renegotiated contracts. The president will include this announcement in his State of the Union Address tonight.
While it’s unfortunate that the order cannot apply to existing workers until their contracts  are renegotiated, the president’s action adds momentum to the fight for a federal minimum wage increase that would benefit all Americans. In signing this order, the president has taken action. Now it is up to Congress to finish the job.
Demos’ research quantified the expansive size of the low-wage workforce supported by federal taxpayer dollars. We found that nearly two million Americans paid through federal contracts, grants, loans, concession agreements, health care spending, and property leases were paid less than $12 an hour. Worse, our later research showed that the government is spending an estimated $21 to $24 billion a year to pay private contractors for the compensation of top executives. These findings put together describe a major engine of inequality in the center of our economy—underwritten by our tax dollars.
The president has a responsibility to make sure taxpayers dollars are being used wisely, and research shows that better paid workers are more productive, with less turnover. President Obama’s decision today is in keeping with the precedent that ensures that employees working on America’s behalf are treated fairly on the job, and that companies that have the privilege of doing business with the United States are upholding high standards of employment practices. 
We’re thrilled today to see the work of our partners across the country reach fruition -- especially the brave federal contract and concession workers organizing with Good Jobs Nation who walked out on strike over and over again in the past year and outspoken members of Congress like Keith Ellison, Raul Grijalva, Eleanor Holmes-Norton and Senator Bernie Sanders who stood up for people working on behalf of America.
I feel so fortunate that I, my indispensable research partner Robert Hiltonsmith, and all my Demos colleagues could be a part of it.",blog
"Americans believe that hard work should be rewarded – people who go to work every day should not then be forced to raise their families in poverty. Yet today nearly a quarter of working adults in the U.S. are laboring at jobs that do not pay enough to support a family at a minimally acceptable level. Because their wages are so low, working people are forced to rely on public benefits, from Medicaid to food stamps to rental assistance, in order to make ends meet. Raising work standards would enable them to become more self-reliant and would raise the floor for all working people.
Increasing mobility out of low-wage, no-benefit jobs, as we propose with the Career Opportunity Plan, is part of the solution, but fails to fully address the problem. Regardless of how many training opportunities are available to individuals, millions of jobs as home health aides, food service workers, retail salespeople and other currently low-wage occupations will still exist and, in fact, are projected to be among the nation’s fastest growing positions in the future.1 The nation must act to ensure that these jobs can, at minimum, lift families above the poverty line and provide basic workplace protections, strengthening the floor for employment in the United States. By lifting the bottom of the nation’s labor market, we give working people a firm base from which they can work their way into the middle class. We also put a stronger backstop on the declining job quality of many formerly middle-class occupations.
Raising the lowest wages is the first step. The current minimum wage of $7.25 an hour is a rate at which it is impossible for working Americans to independently pay their rent, feed their families or get needed medical care—much less save for the types of investments that make it possible to lift oneself into the middle class, like an education, a first home, or the chance to start a business. Indeed, the value of the minimum wage today is 30 percent below its peak in 1968. A majority of minimum wage earners are adults living in low-income households and making significant contributions to their family’s total income. Assuming a full-time work schedule, a minimum wage job at the current rate of $7.25 an hour brings in an annual income of $15,080 – not enough to lift a family of three with a single working parent over the federal poverty threshold. The federal minimum wage for workers who earn tips – including food service workers, hotel bellhops, and nail service employees – is only $2.13 an hour and has not increased in more than 20 years. We propose raising the minimum to $10.00 an hour and $5.50 an hour for tipped workers, and linking these minimums to inflation, lifting working families out of poverty and ensuring that the value of the minimum wage does not erode further.
As inadequate as the minimum wage is, millions of American workers bring home even less. Wage theft – the practice of illegally underpaying workers – has become commonplace in the low-wage labor market. A study of employment conditions in America’s largest cities found that one in four low-wage workers were paid less than the minimum wage in a given week.2 Altogether, wage violations (including paying less than minimum wage, making employees work off the clock, pilfering tips, misclassifying employees as independent contractors, and a host of other schemes) robbed low-income employees of $2,634 annually on average, out of total average earnings of just $17,616. In addition to harming the families of low-income workers, wage theft drains tax revenue, deprives neighborhood businesses of the income low-income families would be spending, and puts law-abiding employers at a competitive disadvantage with those who break the law. It’s difficult to imagine anything more basic to a free economy than the right of an employee to be paid for his or her work: we propose strengthening the enforcement of basic workplace laws so that workers can bring home their full pay.
In addition to raising and enforcing workplace standards, giving all working people a shot at the middle class will require expanding the reach of basic labor protections to incorporate categories of workers that are currently left out. Domestic workers – a category that includes nannies, housekeepers, and elderly caregivers – and farm workers are among the employees who have been deliberately excluded from the protections of federal and state labor laws, originally due to discrimination against a labor force made up predominantly of women and people of color. Both industries now have a predominantly immigrant workforce and are generally low paid: a survey of domestic workers in New York found 26 percent earn wages that put them below the poverty line.3 Farm workers experience poverty rates more than double that of other wage and salary workers.4 These employees, who are a critical part of our economy, should not have to raise their families in poverty.
Finally, we add a new workplace standard: everyone gets sick, so it’s no surprise that an overwhelming 77 percent of Americans say that having paid sick days is very important for workers.5 Yet two out of three low-wage workers in the U.S. – the employees who can least afford to miss a paycheck – do not have a single paid sick day to recover from illness or take care of sick child or relative.6 These workers must choose between losing a day’s pay or coming to work sick, endangering their own health and the public. Many low-wage workers even risk losing their jobs and health coverage if they call in sick. According to one survey, one in six Americans says that they or a family member have been fired, suspended, punished, or threatened by an employer for missing work due to illness.7The result is a more fearful and precarious low-wage labor force, just one illness away from slipping into poverty. The solution is simple: at least 145 countries around the world provide employees with some guarantee of paid sick days for short or long-term illnesses.8 But while states and cities from Connecticut to Seattle have acted in recent years to secure a few days off for sick workers, the United States as a whole offers no such guarantee. We propose a minimum nationwide standard that would enable workers to earn paid sick days. 
Despite the frequently cited concern, improving conditions for low-wage workers does not inevitably lead to loss of employment. Indeed, research shows that a higher minimum wage does not result in lost jobs.9 For example, there is no evidence that states that increased their minimum wages above the federal level suffered job loss as a result. This research confirms earlier work by economists David Card and Alan Krueger.10 In fact, minimum wage increases stimulate economic growth by putting money in the pockets of people most likely to spend it: a recent study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago concluded that every $1.00 increase in the minimum wage results in a $2,800 boost in spending by a low-wage worker’s household over the following year.11Research on guaranteeing paid sick days similarly shows a net economic benefit and no loss of jobs.12
In an era where all able-bodied adults are expected to work, we must ensure that all American jobs meet basic standards of decent employment and keep families out of poverty. To achieve this, we propose the following policies:
1. Increase the minimum wage:
2. Guarantee paid sick days based on the Healthy Families Act of 2011, (H.R. 1876, S. 984). 
3. Prevent wage theft based on the Wage Theft Prevention Act of 2010 and Fair Playing Field Act of 2010.
4. Extend labor protections to excluded workers.

"With $485.9 billion in global revenue and 1.5 million employees in the U.S. alone, Walmart the corporation isn’t going away anytime soon. But this Thursday evening, I’ll argue that its business model – based on low pay, understaffing, and low respect for the employees that make the business function – deserves to go the way of the dinosaurs.
Facing off against conservative economist Richard Vedder and the Manhattan Institute’s John Tierney, I will team up with historian Nelson Lichtenstein in a public debate about whether the Walmart’s way of doing business merits longevity. The debate is organized by Intelligence Squared US.
You can watch live online, April 6 at 6:45pm at intelligencesquaredus.org 
If “long live Walmart?” is the question, then the answer is clear: Walmart must change substantially if it is to be worthy of a long life.
My research has examined a number of ways the nation’s largest private employer could improve pay, benefits and scheduling, including redirecting the $6.6 billion Walmart spent on share repurchases in 2013 to make a greater investment in its 825,000 low-wage employees. Without raising prices a dime, Walmart could have used these funds to provide a raise of $5.13 per hour, boosting productivity and sales in the process.  
I’ve also looked at Walmart’s checkered history as the largest private employer of women in the US, including facing the biggest gender discrimination lawsuit in American history, with numerous claims that are not yet settled. I argue that If Walmart fully addressed the concerns of the 807,000 women who enable its stores to operate every day, it would transform the retail landscape and be a powerful positive force for working women throughout the economy.
Walmart has recently raised its starting pay for employees. Yet, as hundreds of thousands of Walmart workers – especially those standing up and organizing with OUR Walmart – can tell you, Walmart’s most publicized reforms have been more flash than substance.
At the same time, as Senator Bernie Sanders points out, the Walton family – six wealthy heirs who still own half of Walmart and continue to benefit as the company profits –  already owns more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of Americans.
Walmart remains in the center of the story about America’s growing inequality and the ways our economy is deeply out of balance. I look forward to making the case that the company must change substantially to be worth any hope that it “live long.” Watch live online, April 6 at 6:45pm at intelligencesquaredus.org  ",blog
"Dear Ms. Deshommes:
Demos strongly urges the Department of Homeland Security to withdraw the proposed rule to radically enlarge the list of criteria that will be used to decide whether an immigrant is likely to become a “public charge.”
Demos is a non-partisan public policy organization working for an America where we all have an equal say in our democracy and an equal chance in our economy. Research on families’ economic stability clearly indicates that this proposed rule amounts to a harsh and unfair penalty on all but the wealthiest immigrant families, and is likely to cause immense financial hardship for households and communities in the United States.1 Demos’ own research on the nation’s credit reporting system particularly highlights the unsuitability of using credit reports and scores for immigration purposes as the proposed rule intends.2
We already see evidence that merely proposing an expansion of the programs and factors to be considered for the public charge analysis is causing widespread fear and confusion, deterring families from accessing critical resources for basic necessities such as food (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), housing (Section 8 subsidies) and health care (Medicaid).3 If implemented, the proposed rule could cause economic suffering on a broad scale, as 1 in 4 American children today have an immigrant parent.
One particularly misguided proposal is the provision at proposed § 212.22(b)(4)(i)(H), which would require USCIS to consider an immigrant’s “credit history (i.e., credit report) and credit score” in determining whether the immigrant is a public charge. Credit reports and scores were designed for a single purpose: to enable lenders to assess the likelihood that a borrower will become 90 days late on a credit obligation.4 They contain no information about a consumer’s income or earnings and have no bearing on whether someone will become a public charge.
We are especially concerned that using credit history to evaluate immigrants will have a disparate impact on immigrants of color, because discrimination in lending, employment, education, and housing have produced significant racial disparities in credit history. Research from the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Reserve Board, and other investigators concludes that African-American and Latino households tend to have worse credit, on average, than white households.5 By using credit reports and scores to make immigration decisions, DHS will be basing its determinations on a factor that clearly and unjustly penalizes communities of color.
Using credit scores to determine likelihood of becoming a public charge is especially illogical because a significant factor in a credit score is the number of years a consumer has had and used credit in the United States—a factor that automatically disadvantages immigrants simply because they are immigrants and may not have been in the country long enough to develop an extensive credit history.6 As a result, many immigrants are among the estimated 26 million Americans who do not have a credit history or whose credit files are thin.7 Immigrant families should not be penalized simply because they have avoided taking on debt.
In addition, credit reports are highly inaccurate, rendering them unreliable for making crucial immigration determinations. A comprehensive 2013 study by the Federal Trade Commission found that 1 in 5 American consumers had a material error (an error that negatively impacted their credit history) on a credit report from one of three major credit reporting companies.8 These rampant credit reporting errors are notoriously difficult for consumers to resolve, a difficulty that would be compounded for immigrants who may confront substantial barriers in terms of knowledge, language, and resources that would impede them from accessing their credit reports or disputing any errors.9 For example, U.S. credit reports are only available in English.
The proposed public charge rule will damage millions of families working to build a future in the United States. Demos urges DHS to immediately retract the proposal because it undercuts the ability of immigrant communities—which are integral to American communities as a whole—to thrive. The proposition to use credit reports and scores to evaluate the likelihood of becoming a public charge is an especially unsound and inappropriate component of a fundamentally destructive and pernicious proposal.

"The Disparate Impact standard is critical to continued and enhanced opportunity to access fair credit, housing, and homeownership. Demos strongly opposes efforts to undermine this longstanding enforcement tool.
To Whom It May Concern:
I am writing on behalf of Demos in response to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) notice referenced above concerning proposed changes to the disparate impact standard. The existing Disparate Impact Rule is an essential tool for contesting discriminatory housing policies that appear to be neutral but ultimately affect members of a protected class—including communities of color—in highly damaging ways. The Disparate Impact standard is critical to continued and enhanced opportunity to access fair credit, housing, and homeownership. Accordingly, Demos strongly opposes efforts to undermine this longstanding enforcement tool.  We urge HUD to entirely withdraw the Proposed Rule, making no changes to the current Disparate Impact Rule. 
Demos is a public policy and advocacy organization that helps power the movement for a just, inclusive, multiracial democracy and an economy rooted in racial equity. Our extensive research and advocacy work on fair credit and lending includes studies on debt, credit reporting, and student lending.1 Our work analyzes the often-subtle and ostensibly “colorblind” forms of discrimination in lending that have a profound impact over time, contributing to America’s deep and growing racial wealth gaps.2 In 2013, for example, the median white household possessed $13 in net wealth for every dollar held by the median Black household in 2013. That same year, the median white household possessed $10 for each dollar held by the median Latinx household. Because homeownership is the principal source of wealth for millions of American families, discrimination in mortgage lending plays a particularly troubling role in worsening wealth disparities by race.3 
The Fair Housing Act, with its ambitious statement of purpose “to provide…for fair housing throughout the United States,”4 represents our shared interest as a nation in ensuring that housing opportunities are available to all. Whether people rent or own homes, everyone deserves access to a safe and stable place to live, and the opportunities it provides. Central to the effectiveness of the FHA in achieving Congress’s stated goal is that the Act prohibits intentional discriminatory acts and facially “neutral” policies that limit housing opportunities based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, the presence of families with children, and people with disabilities.  Fully realizing the promises of the Fair Housing Act for every person in the United States is central to HUD’s mission.  
Demos shares this central mission and we write to urge you not to revise HUD’s existing Disparate Impact Rule.  HUD’s new proposed rule would undermine HUD’s ability to meet its critical obligation to achieve the Fair Housing Act’s “central purpose . . . to eradicate discriminatory practices within a sector of our Nation’s economy.”5 HUD’s current Disparate Impact Rule is a necessary tool to achieve fairer standards in lending, rationally-based insurance pricing, and homeownership accessibility.  
We are especially concerned that increasing the requirements to bring a disparate impact case will make it more difficult to combat discriminatory mortgage lending that contributes to America’s racial wealth gap. Because homeownership is Americans’ primary means of building wealth, the racial wealth gap is closely connected to the nation’s unequal homeownership rates. In the second quarter of 2019, 73 percent of white households owned their homes, compared to 41 percent of Black households and 47 percent of Latinx households.6 According to an analysis by Demos and the Institute on Assets and Social Policy at Brandeis University, equalizing homeownership rates between Black, Latinx and white households would reduce wealth disparities between Black and white households by 31 percent and would decrease wealth disparities between Latinx and white households by 28 percent.7 
The effect of equalizing homeownership rates across race and ethnicity would be even greater if not for generations of discrimination—including redlining, racial exclusion from neighborhoods where home values appreciate, and biased lending practices—that segregate people of color into neighborhoods subject to systematic disinvestment so that even when Black and Latinx families own their homes, they grow in value at a far slower rate than homes in predominantly white neighborhoods. By making it dramatically more demanding to demonstrate the impact of discrimination in home lending and home buying, HUD’s proposed changes to the Disparate Impact Rule radically undermine a critical tool for combatting these noxious trends. 
HUD’s Proposed Rule would destroy disparate impact liability and allow insurance companies, financial institutions, and other major corporations to engage in covert discriminatory practices without any consequences. It would leave communities of color and other groups without protection from unfair and discriminatory policies. HUD’s Proposed Rule goes against the very purpose of the Fair Housing Act to prohibit housing discrimination and instead gives companies more defenses to justify their policies. 
Demos strongly urges you not to proceed with the proposed rule. HUD should withdraw this proposed rule immediately and follow its mission to enforce our fair housing and fair lending laws.

"We don’t only have a jobs deficit in this country. We have a deficit of good jobs. Here's why.
We have heard a great deal this evening about the very urgent need for jobs in this country and for public investment that can both create those jobs and address public needs and get our economy moving again with a strong trajectory for the future. We need it! And it will ultimately help to address that other deficit too, the budget deficit, because when you have strong growth, tax revenue increases.
But we don’t only have a jobs deficit in this country: we have a deficit of good jobs. I think we all know, intuitively, what good jobs are: jobs that enable working people to support their families, have health coverage, and look forward to retiring someday. But also jobs where you’re not afraid to take a day off if you get sick, or have a sick child, and where the work schedule doesn’t change unpredictably day-to-day and week-to-week – so you can actually plan a life and be involved in your community and your children’s education.  Maybe you even get a paid vacation. That’s a good job. 
And that’s why recognizing that 12.8 million people are out of work and millions more are underemployed or have given up looking is still only part of the problem. A quarter of adults who are working full-time are not earning enough money to meet their family’s basic economic needs. This is a trend that’s become worse with the latest recession. But this is also part of a longer term problem:  in the thirty years from 1979 to 2009, median hourly wages only grew 10.1% in real dollars even though productivity grew 80% over that time period. That’s really a story of wage stagnation over the long term, thirty years of nearly frozen wages.  At the same time, we see declining job security, falling rates of employer provided health coverage, a shift away from guaranteed pensions or any retirement plan at all.
I think this jobs story sometimes gets lost when we’re thinking about inequality in America. We think about bank bailouts, tax cuts for the rich, and the rising cost of a college education, all of which are very relevant, but the public conversation can tend to miss the policy choices that led to the decline of good jobs.
Then, we begin to believe that the kinds of jobs we have, and the quality of jobs, is simply a result of the inexorable workings of the free market. We have more international trade, more competition, technological change, and viola, we’ve lost good jobs and the only policy option is to educate our workforce so they can compete for the few decent jobs that still exist. Education is great – it’s important, but it’s not enough. And that very common story about our economy leaves out the critical role of public policy in getting us where we are today.
Our economy is shaped by public policy decisions. It always has been. We built a strong middle class in this country in the years after World War II on the basis of some good policy choices: rules that allowed working people to organize unions and demand fair wages, laws that guaranteed a minimum wage and overtime pay, opportunities to go to college on the GI Bill and get better jobs as a result, and a host of other policies that structured the way our economy worked and helped to produce good jobs. We know there were also a lot of bad policy choices at the time: decisions that largely excluded women and people of color from good job opportunities, for example. But the point is, these were policy decisions and we should look at the choices we’ve made over the last 30 years, as job quality declined for so many people.
We’ve deregulated industries, allowing more companies to treat their workers as independent contractors, among many other consequences. We’ve privatized public services, turning over work that used to be done by middle-class public sector workers to whatever contractor offers the lowest bid. We’ve let the value of the minimum wage fall, and have undermined the rights of working people to join unions. And we’ve failed to invest sufficiently in an educated workforce. All of those policy decisions weaken the ability of working people to get a fair deal in the labor market. That’s a big part of the story behind growing inequality. In a recent study, Harvard professors Bruce Western and Jake Rosenfeld provide evidence that the decline of union representation alone accounts for as much as third to the growth of income inequality among working men since 1973. That’s a decline that was aided and abetted by our policy choices.
I really want to end on a positive note and there are really a lot of good things to say about where the country could go from here, but first I have to say a few words about the forces pushing us in the wrong direction. In Congress, Republicans are trying to defund and restrict the National Labor Relations Board, which protects the right to join unions.  We see efforts to strip public sector employees of their rights to bargain over basic working conditions in Wisconsin, Ohio and New Hampshire. In Indiana, the governor and state legislature passed a law decimating the ability of private sector unions to sustain themselves by collecting dues. The restaurant industry in Florida is pushing a proposal to lower the state minimum wage for restaurant workers. Newt Gingrich has campaigned on rolling back child labor laws, and we’ve seen efforts to do it in Maine and Missouri. Of course, very few people will come out and say, we want to lower wages for Americans, but in the name of lower costs for employers and for the government, that’s exactly what we’re doing.  
These are great ways to make the deficit in good jobs bigger.
So how do we shrink it? What policies will help us get to a country where everyone who wants to work can get a decent job?  We do need job creation. I think President Obama’s proposed American Jobs Act would be a step in the right direction. But at the federal level, we can also be thinking a lot bigger. In a paper for Demos, economist Philip Harvey made the case for a direct and immediate public jobs program.  A $100 billion, two-year public jobs program would create more than 1.5 million new jobs at peak employment. According to Harvey’s plan, the program would create jobs for the unemployed addressing unmet needs in their own communities. Federally funded jobs could include improving public buildings and parks, building affordable housing, providing child care and elder care, and staffing after-school and tutoring programs. There would be safeguards to ensure that the new public jobs are not used in ways that replace existing workers. 
But as I’ve tried to argue, just having more jobs won’t be sufficient to reverse the decline in job quality. To do that, we need to start by ensuring that all American jobs meet basic standards of decent employment. I’m delighted that Assembly Speaker Silver wants to raise New York’s minimum wage and index to inflation, and we should do that nationally too. The research is now very clearly that minimum wage increases do not cause job loss. We should also guarantee paid sick days to all working people, as the state of Connecticut has done. And we can ensure that worker protections are effective and apply to everyone in the labor market. In New York State we had two great victories on this front last year: domestic workers have more rights on the job and all working people have more recourse against wage theft. Both of those New York laws should be models for the country. 
Federal contracting is another opportunity for good policy. Companies that have contracts with the federal government employ 22 percent of the entire American workforce. And yet, an estimated 80 percent of the 5.4 million federally contracted service workers earn low wages.  In 2010 President Obama proposed using the federal government’s tremendous buying power to leverage better wages and working conditions at the private sector companies that it buys goods and services from. That’s a proposal we should revive.
The last point I want to make is about unions, because I think they remain the best force for people to get a fair deal at work. Unions not only bargain collectively for better wages and benefits for their members, they also raise compensation for workers they don’t represent, mostly by scaring non-union employers into raising wages to avoid unionization. High unionization boosts the share of economic growth going to working people rather than to corporate profits or the very highest earners. And public policies that enabled employers to violate the spirit of labor laws by harassing and threatening workers who tried to form a union at work have a lot to do with the decline of organized labor.  So strengthening Americans’ ability to exercise their right to join unions is key, not for the narrow interests of union members, but for our job quality as a whole. 
I will conclude there, and I’d love to take your questions and discuss!",testimony-and-public-comment
"My new study out this week from Demos and the National Council of La Raza (NCLR) looks at credit card debt in the Latino community. But it isn’t ultimately about credit cards at all.
Instead, it’s a look at how our unemployment insurance system has failed to protect out-of-work Americans, how vast sectors of our economy fail to offer employees health coverage, and how wages have failed to keep up with the cost of living. It’s an account of how Latinos, who are disproportionately uninsured, disproportionately employed in low-wage jobs, and historically face difficulty in accessing mainstream credit opportunities, are among those bearing the brunt of these trends. And it’s a look at how discriminatory treatment and fraud continue to plague Latinos in the United States, even when dealing with large and mainstream financial services companies. Finally, amidst the multiple economic failures described above, the study is a hopeful glimpse at how common-sense regulation can work successfully to help households save money and pay down debt. And okay, maybe it’s also about credit cards.
First, consider unemployment.
The study finds that unemployment is a leading contributor to credit card debt among Latino households. Among low- and middle-income Latino households carrying credit card debt, 1 in 3 report that a layoff or other loss of a job contributed to their current credit card debt and one 1 in 5 report job loss was the single greatest contributor to their debt. This isn’t the all-too-typical credit card story about the need for more financial literacy or personal responsibility in spending – instead it speaks to the 2.4 million Latinos who were unemployed, and the additional 2.5 million more who were underemployed in 2012 when the survey data was collected. The National Employment Law Project finds that due to a combination of language barriers, lack of familiarity with the program, and other factors, Latinos are less likely than Americans of other backgrounds both to apply for unemployment benefits and to receive benefits when they do apply. Even when unemployed workers do apply and qualify for benefits, payments may be too low to enable households to make ends meet, and benefits may run out before workers are able to find another job.
The result? For low- and middle-income Latinos – and many other indebted Americans—credit cards become a privatized “plastic safety net” to pay for groceries and other necessities when the public safety net is insufficient. But unlike unemployment insurance or food stamps, credit card borrowing comes with high interest charges – at rates that turn out to be significantly higher for Latino and African American borrowers than for whites.
Credit cards are also used to make up for inadequate wages when workers are on the job. In 2012, the median Latino man earned just 67 cents for every dollar paid to a non-Hispanic white man, while the median Latina earned just 59 cents. It’s troubling – but not surprising – to learn that among low- and middle-income Latino households with credit card debt, 43 percent report using their credit cards to pay for basic living expenses such as rent, mortgage payments, groceries or utilities in the past year because they didn’t have enough money in their checking or savings accounts. The Department of Labor notes that 6.8 million Latino workers would benefit if Congress raises the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour, including not just workers earning minimum wage but those paid just above the minimum who would also see their paychecks rise.
For more on how credit card use in the Latino community reflects disparities in health insurance coverage, the growing racial and ethnic wealth gap, and unequal access to credit, see the report itself. And if you’re wondering about the impact of credit card debt on other communities, such as African Americans and senior citizens, see the earlier reports in our series.
But if you’ve been waiting for the good news on Latinos and credit cards, here it is: credit card reform legislation passed in 2009 has succeeded in adding new protections for borrowers and making credit cards a safer, fairer financial product. Latino credit cardholders have especially benefitted, reporting that they are now paying down debt more quickly and saving money by avoiding unfair fees. As a result of new disclosures and reduced fees in the mandated by the CARD Act, 38 percent of low- and middle-income Latino households with credit card debt report that they are paying more toward their credit card balances in a typical month, 41 percent say they are charged late fees less often, and 36 percent report they are charged over-the-limit fees less frequently—benefits greater than those reported by credit card borrowers as a whole.
While financial services reform alone fails to address the deeper issues of why Latino households find themselves turning to credit cards to make up for larger shortcomings in job quality and the public safety net, it does offer a small indicator of how smart public policy can make a concrete and positive difference on people’s lives. If we intelligently regulate credit card fees, borrowers will save more and pay less of them. If we improve the public safety net and improve job quality, households may not have to turn to credit cards and other forms of debt to make ends meet in the first place. ",blog
"Priorities of Rep. Ryan's Budget: Click To Visit Full Version
Today the U.S. House of Representatives will vote on Rep. Paul Ryan’s budget proposal, a plan to dismantle Medicare, slash Medicaid, eviscerate the safety net, and at the same time pump up defense spending, and preserve tax breaks for the affluent and the mega-rich alike. In short, it’s a budget for the 1 percent, tailor-made to confirm Americans’ growing suspicions that government acts to serve the interests of large corporations and the very wealthy, not the majority of citizens.
The good news is, it’s not the only game in town. The House will also vote today on a proposal from the Congressional Progressive Caucus called The Budget for All. This document sets forth a very different set of priorities: “when you are old, you will not live in poverty; when you are sick, you will have affordable health care; and when you have fallen on tough times, you will have support to get back on your feet,” in the words of its framers.",blog
"Strategies For Turning Bad Jobs Into Quality Employment
At a time when millions of Americans remain unemployed, underemployed and out of the labor force entirely, public debate has correctly focused on job creation. With more than four jobseekers for every single job opening, the nation’s deep jobs deficit must be urgently addressed.
But the availability of jobs, while critical, is not enough. To realize the core American value that hard work should be rewarded, we need more jobs capable of supporting a family with a decent standard of living. Nearly a quarter of working adults find themselves in jobs that do not pay enough to support a family at a minimally acceptable level. Millions of workers who are putting in more hours of work than ever find it impossible to ascend to the middle class— or are unable to stay there. The recession widened the already growing earnings shortfall: during the downturn, 60 percent of U.S. jobs lost were middle-income positions, yet the majority of jobs gained during the recovery have been in low-wage occupations. This downward shift in labor costs has helped drive corporate profits to an all-time high this year, but at an enormous cost to our families’ well-being and to our consumer-driven recovery.
In this brief, we explore a variety of strategies government, communities, and far-sighted employers can pursue to raise job quality and ensure that hard-working Americans can get ahead.",policy-briefs
"“American workers should have paid sick leave,” announced the New York Times in a staff editorial on Sunday, “and New York City could set a standard for the rest of the nation.” With that, the nation’s newspaper of record waded into the long fight for what most Americans already say is a basic workplace right: the chance to recuperate from sickness without losing a day’s pay -- or worse yet, getting fired from your job.
July 18, 2012 New York women rally for paid sick days on the steps of City Hall
Those of us who have paid sick leave tend to take it for granted. Yet 40 million Americans, including two out of three low-wage workers in the U.S. -- the employees who can least afford to miss a paycheck -- do not have a single paid sick day to recover from illness or take care of sick child or relative. These workers must choose between losing a day’s pay or coming to work sick, endangering their own health and the public. Many low-wage workers even risk losing their jobs and health coverage if they call in sick. According to a University of Chicago survey, one in six Americans says that they or a family member have been fired, suspended, punished, or threatened by an employer for missing work due to illness.  The result is a more fearful and precarious low-wage labor force, just one illness away from slipping into poverty.
The solution is simple: at least 145 countries around the world provide employees with some guarantee of paid sick days for short or long-term illnesses. But while states and cities from Connecticut to Seattle and San Francisco to the District of Columbia have acted in recent years to secure a few days off for sick workers, the United States as a whole offers no such guarantee. The New York Times is right to observe that “the best way to address this workplace and public health problem is with a national law requiring businesses to provide paid sick leave.” But they are also correct that the Washington status quo makes progress unlikely in the near future. That’s where New York City comes in.
As a highly successful 2006 law in San Francisco has demonstrated, paid sick time can work at the municipal level.  That’s why ever since, a broad coalition of New Yorkers have been working for a paid sick time standard in New York City. Research has found that paid sick time in New York would not harm the economy or job growth, and would in fact save on health care costs, and benefit small businesses with less turnover and a more motivated workforce.  
The need and evidence of positive impact is so great that a veto-proof majority of 36 New York City council members support a proposed city law that already includes a number of compromises to accommodate business interests. Now the law faces just one roadblock: City Council Speaker Christine Quinn has refused to bring the legislation to a vote.
The pressure is on. Thousands of New Yorkers have signed a petition appealing to Quinn to stop blocking the Paid Sick Time Act. And the Speaker is now engaged in what Demos fellow Sharon Lerner  has called “a feminist showdown,” a public face-off between Quinn, who hopes to become New York’s first female mayor, and feminist icon Gloria Steinem, who, along with some 200 other powerful women in politics, has called on Quinn to bring the bill to a vote. Steinem has announced that her support for Quinn –whom she personally introduced at a major fund-raiser last fall – is contingent upon Quinn’s support for paid sick days legislation.
New York has the chance to be a progressive leader, providing a critical benefit to 1.5 million working people who can’t afford to get sick, and helping to propel the entire nation in the right direction. Let’s get it right.",blog
"We all deserve an equal opportunity to be hired based on our experience and abilities. Yet discriminatory hiring continues to shape the U.S. labor market in ways that systematically disadvantage people of color, women, LGBTQ workers, people with disabilities and other targeted groups. Due largely to the stigma of a conviction record, formerly incarcerated people face some of the toughest barriers to securing work. Now, thanks to new research from the Prison Policy Initiative, we know how extraordinarily high their rate of unemployment is.
In 2008 (the most recent year for which data are available), unemployment among the general public was 5.8 percent. Yet formerly incarcerated people faced an unemployment rate of more than 27 percent. As researchers Lucius Coulote and Daniel Kopf point out, this level of joblessness is higher than the total U.S. unemployment rate during the Great Depression. And unemployment was highest within the first 2 years after release from incarceration: More than 30 percent of job seekers were unemployed within the first 2 years of release.
African American job seekers are hit particularly hard. In the first place, communities of color are disproportionately impacted by incarceration as a result of racial bias throughout the criminal justice system. The unemployment rate was higher for black job seekers who had been incarcerated, particularly black women, than for white men or women who had been incarcerated.
Job seekers with an arrest or conviction record deserve a chance to start fresh. Each year nearly 700,000 people return to our communities from incarceration; everyone has a stake in ensuring that they are able to integrate back into society and to support themselves and their families. Formerly incarcerated people who are able to obtain steady employment are less likely to re-offend. Yet the Prison Policy Initiative’s new findings show how inadequate our current policies are at reintegrating returning citizens.
In our federal policy briefing book, Everyone’s Economy, Demos recommends policies that include requiring employers to remove questions about arrest and conviction from initial job applications (known as “ban the box”); mandating that employers wait until after they make a conditional offer of employment to request a job applicant’s arrest or conviction record; and following hiring guidelines from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which direct employers to take into account the time passed since the offense, whether the offense is related to the job, and evidence of rehabilitation. The recommendations draw on best practices developed by the National Employment Law Project.
While 30 states, as well as many local jurisdictions, have adopted some form of fair-chance hiring policy, these efforts have not gone far enough. The Prison Policy Initiative recommends additional reforms around expunging criminal records, reforming occupational licensing rules that bar people with past convictions, and offering tax incentives to employers who hire people with a conviction record. A public jobs guarantee (see page 40 of Everyone’s Economy) would go further to address the problem: By making the federal government an employer of last resort for the formerly incarcerated and any other Americans seeking work, involuntary joblessness would be eliminated. People with conviction records would have far greater opportunity to reintegrate into their communities and support themselves and their loved ones. The rest of us would too.",blog
"The opportunity to work hard and get ahead is a core value of American society. Yet today in the United States, qualified job seekers are turned away from employment because of their personal credit history. People whose credit is damaged as a result of medical debt, student loans, a layoff, divorce, predatory lending, identity theft, or simple error are shut out of jobs—despite a lack of evidence connecting someone’s credit history with their job performance. Senator Elizabeth Warren’s Equal Employment for All Act would prohibit the use of personal credit history in employment, eliminating a serious barrier to economic security for many Americans. This fact sheet discusses the major reasons why the Equal Employment for All Act is critical to ensuring fair and equal access to job opportunities.
Nearly half of all employers run credit checks on new job applicants.
Employment credit checks are widespread and used by employers to screen job applicants for a wide range of positions. For example, credit checks may be required for jobs doing maintenance work, offering telephone tech support, working as a delivery driver, or selling frozen yogurt, as well as financial posts. A 2012 survey by the Society of Human Resources Management found that 47 percent of employers use credit checks when hiring for some or all positions at their firm.1
Americans are denied jobs because of credit checks.
A nationally representative survey by Demos finds that among low- and middle-income households with credit card debt, one in four unemployed Americans has been asked to submit to a credit check as part of a job application.2 One in ten job applicants in this survey group were told they would not be hired for a position because of their credit.3
Credit checks were never designed to assess potential job performance—or measure character.
Credit reports were developed to help lenders assess the risks associated with making a loan. Over the last few years, they have been aggressively marketed to employers as a means to gauge an applicant’s character or likelihood to commit theft or fraud. Yet there is no proven link between personal credit reports and criminal behavior or performance of a specific job.4 A spokesperson for TransUnion, one of the major credit reporting companies, admitted in 2010: “We don’t have any research to show any statistical correlation between what’s in somebody’s credit report and their job performance or their likelihood to commit fraud.”5
A weak or poor credit history is often linked to medical debt and unemployment.
Research by the Federal Reserve Board finds that more than half of all accounts reported by collection agencies on credit reports consist of medical debt.6 Demos’ study of Americans with credit card debt similarly finds that poor credit is associated with lack of health coverage and medical debt as well as household unemployment.7 Unemployed workers in particular can become trapped in a Catch-22: job-seekers are unable to secure work because of damaged credit and are then unable to escape debt and improve their credit because they cannot find work.
Employment credit checks can have a discriminatory impact on people of color.
Research from the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Reserve Board, and other investigators concludes that African American and Latino households tend to have worse credit, on average, than white households.8 Racial disparities in credit history may reflect the damage done by predatory lending that continues to target communities of color, as well as the enduring impact of racial discrimination in employment, lending, education, and housing. One result is that when credit history is used to evaluate job candidates, people of color may disproportionately be screened out. Numerous civil rights organizations, including the NAACP, National Council of La Raza, and Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, have publicly op- posed the use of employment credit checks.9
Credit reporting errors are common and impact employment decisions in unpredictable ways.
A comprehensive 2013 study by the Federal Trade Commission found that one in five American consumers had a material error (an error that negatively impacted their credit history) on a credit report from one of three major credit reporting companies.10 While not all of these errors are serious enough to affect consumer borrowing, the impact on employment is far broader because what employers look for in a credit report—and how much they weigh different factors like late bills, foreclosures, or accounts in collection—is entirely subjective. A credit reporting mistake that is too small to make a difference in applying for credit might nevertheless stand out to an employer and cost someone a job. At the same time, credit reporting errors are notoriously difficult for consumers to resolve.
Employment credit checks are an invasion of privacy—a particular concern for people with disabilities and victims of domestic abuse.
Domestic abuse, divorce, and medical bills are among the leading contributors to credit problems. In cases of domestic abuse, it is not uncommon for the abuser to purposely ruin a spouse’s credit as a way of controlling the spouse.11 Despite common sense and legal recognition that questions about marital status, medical conditions, and abuse ought to be out of bounds in the hiring process, many employers ask prospective employees to “explain” any credit problems brought to light by a credit report.12 This forces job applicants to choose between discussing a recent divorce, confidential medical issues, and/or very personal details regarding the abusive dynamics in a relationship, or risk losing a job opportunity. Questions about medical debt particularly impact people with disabilities, for whom disclosure of a medical condition may lead to discriminatory treatment.
Conclusion
The use of personal credit history to screen job applicants illegitimately obstructs access to employment, placing an unnecessary obstacle in the path of job seekers who are often already disadvantaged by racial discrimination, disability status, lack of health coverage, unemployment and other economic challenges. Senator Warren’s Equal Employment for All Act would remove this unwarranted barrier, increasing job opportunities for qualified applicants.

"43 million American workers can’t take a day off work when they get sick without losing pay—and President Obama can’t change that. Although the president has urged Congress to pass paid sick days legislation, and encouraged states and cities to act in the absence of federal progress, he cannot enact these laws himself. Just yesterday he was powerless to intervene as Senate Republicans blocked Senator Patty Murray’s effort to bring the Healthy Families Act, guaranteeing workers seven sick days a year, to a vote.
When it comes to the segment of the American workforce employed by federal contractors, however, the president has greater authority. As my colleague Jenn Borchetta has explained the President has the power under the Procurement Act of 1949 to prescribe policies and directives that are in his judgment necessary to an economical and efficient system for obtaining property and services. According to a confidential draft leaked to the New York Times, the president is poised to sign an executive order requiring thousands of federal contractors and subcontractors to provide their workforce with paid sick leave.
Executive action on paid sick days for employees of federal contractors would be in keeping with Obama’s steps to raise workplace standards for contract employees as he would like to see them raised for all American workers. This strategy uses the federal government’s over 1.3 trillion dollars in federal purchasing to place tens of millions Americans on a pathway to the middle class.
And so, over the last two years, President Obama has used his executive authority to raise wages for federal contract workers; ban contractors from employment discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity; ensure that contract employees who discuss their compensation are not retaliated against; and strengthen the screening process to ensure that companies that chronically violate federal workplace laws are no longer rewarded with federal contracts.
Demos is on record calling for a broad Good Jobs Executive Order, which would include raising pay and strengthening legal compliance for contractors, as the president has done, and requiring contractors to offer their employees paid sick days as he now seems poised to do. Another key element? Requiring that contractors respect employees’ right to organize and bargain collectively. It would be an ideal next step.",blog
"The idea is simple: people who get up and go to work every day in one of the world’s richest countries should not have to live in poverty.
That’s why, across the country and throughout the week, low-wage fast food and retail employees walked out on strike, calling for $15 an hour and respect for their right to organize a union.  Claudette Wilson and her co-workers walked out from a Burger King in Detroit, joined by other fast food workers. Andrew Little and his fellow employees went on strike from Victoria’s Secret and other stores and restaurants in Chicago. In St. Louis, members of the United Mine Workers joined employees of Jack in the Box and Hardee's among other fast food franchises in solidarity. And Terrance Wise hit the picket lines in Kansas City on strike from his part-time jobs at Pizza Hut and Burger King. Workers were striking in Flint and Milwaukee as well. Here in New York, I and some Demos colleagues had a chance to join a rally in support of workers at the McDonalds in Union Square (check out the photo).
The strikes have captured national attention and, not surprisingly, begun to generate pushback from low-wage employers and their lobby. The Michigan Restaurant Association announced that fast food has an “unassailable reputation as an industry of opportunity,” insisting that “many have lived the American Dream by starting in entry-level positions and eventually owning their own restaurants.” But that “unassailable reputation” looks like wishful thinking when you consider the actual evidence: as my colleague Mijin Cha noted last week, data reveals occupational mobility within the fast food industry is extremely limited, and opening a franchise is next to impossible for workers that enter through front-line occupations.
Critics also assert that fast food and retail prices will inevitably rise if wages are increased. After all, the increased pay will have to come from somewhere. But former Wall Street analyst and Business Insider CEO Henry Blodgett points out that:
McDonald's could double its restaurant-worker wages  and not increase its prices at all ... but instead just make a little less money. In other words, it could better balance the interests of all three of its stakeholders — shareholders, customers, and employees — instead of shafting employees to deliver as much profit as possible to shareholders.
Even if McDonald’s internalized the entire cost of higher wages, it would still be a highly profitable company.
The truth is, whether employers internalized costs or not, raising wages at the low end would be good for our economy. As I told ABC News,  Unlike corporations that sit on their profits, when low-wage workers have more money in their pockets, they tend to spend it immediately. The added consumer demand gives businesses a reason to create jobs – a critical consideration at a time when job creation remains sluggish and millions of Americans are out of work.
When my colleague Catherine Ruetschlin analyzed this dynamic in the retail industry last fall, she found that if the nation’s largest retailers significantly raised wages for their lowest-paid employees, it could create 100,000 or more new jobs, not only pulling working families out of poverty but also boosting sales for retailers themselves. While the numbers would look different in fast food, higher fast food wages would similarly enable working people to support their families and create jobs. 
That’s why I joined the picket line this week, and will be on the next one too.",blog
"With four job seekers for every single job opening the last thing unemployed Americans need is a hidden barrier standing between them and essential job opportunities. Yet for many, such a barrier exists in the form of an employment credit check -- a hidden obstacle because job applicants may never find out that it is the reason they are denied employment.  The New York Times tells the story of one Queens mother who ran straight into the credit check roadblock.
After nearly two years looking for work, former laundromat manager Maria Ortiz (Photo above. Cr) sought assistance from a non-profit organization that helped her with her resume and sent her out on job interviews:
 “Some of [the interviews], I thought I had experience in what they were asking for, but they would call me and tell me no.”
Ms. Ortiz was baffled by the repeated rejections until her caseworker checked her credit report. Everything made sense then: it showed that damaging, faulty information had been added to her report.
“It said I owe over $75,000 and that I have two cars,” Ms. Ortiz squealed. “I don’t drive! It said I have a mortgage. I don’t have a house!”
Quickly realizing that she needed to correct the false information, Ms. Ortiz and her caseworker sent letters to more than 20 companies and the credit bureaus to set straight which debts were veritably hers.
Even after extensive effort with the assistance of a professional caseworker, Ortiz was turned down for a bank teller position when false information she thought she had corrected reappeared on the employment credit report.
The Times tells Ms. Ortiz’s story as a happy one -- she ultimately succeeded in landing a full-time job. But her ordeal illustrates some of the problems inherent in using personal credit history as an employment screening tool -- a practice that six out of ten employers now utilize for some or all hiring decisions.
First, consider the errors in Ms. Ortiz credit report, which are not out of the ordinary.  A 2008 Federal Trade Commission-sponsored pilot study concluded that about 31 percent of people who reviewed their credit report found some type of error. Even a study funded by the credit reporting industry itself found that more than 20 million Americans could identify material errors in their credit reports.  
Compounding the problem with credit report errors is the reality that many job seekers may not find out that a substandard credit report is the reason they are being denied work. While the Fair Credit Reporting Act requires disclosure of an adverse employment decision made on the basis of credit information, reports suggest that most employers don’t bother. As a result, job seekers like Ms. Ortiz may never realize that a credit report -- erroneous or otherwise -- is the reason they can’t find work. Ms. Ortiz will never know how many of the other jobs she applied for over the course of two years searching for work fell through only because of mistakes on her credit report.
It’s easy to add the advice to check credit reports and address any errors to the long list of other recommendations given to job applicants. But notice how this puts a new burden on an individual already struggling to find work -- now they must also correspond with dozens of companies to fix a mistake made by a corporation they never asked to gather and sell their personal information in the first place. And this “solution” doesn’t touch on the larger problem of unemployed job seekers who genuinely have poor credit because months without a job have made it difficult for them to keep up with their bills.
The better solution? Ban employment credit checks altogether. As I’ve argued in the past, employment credit checks have a discriminatory impact and aren’t reliable for making hiring decisions. A strong law, like the Credit Privacy in Employment Act currently before the New York State legislature (sponsored by State Senator Jeffrey Klein and Assemblyman Eric Stevenson) could save New Yorkers in Ms. Ortiz’s position a world of trouble. Other states that haven’t already taken action should follow suit.",blog
"In New York, your personal credit history is no longer any of your employer’s business.
From universal pre-kindergarten to paid sick days, New York City’s fight against inequality has grabbed national headlines. But recently, the nation’s largest city has quietly taken the lead in dismantling a far less obvious barrier to opportunity: the employment credit check. Thanks to a new law, businesses can no longer discriminate against employees and job seekers simply because they’re late paying bills.
The credit check ban is an important salvo against inequality. More often than not, poor credit is the result of bad luck and societal disadvantages, and is associated with unemployment, lack of health care, and medical debt. As a result of credit checks, someone who is out of work will find it more difficult to get another job, falling further behind on their bills in a vicious catch-22.

"Screengrabs of Spokeo.comIn today’s economy, it’s hard enough to land a job without companies secretly compiling inaccurate dossiers of information about you, then aggressively selling them to employers, who – based on the false or simply irrelevant data – decide not to hire you. Yet employment credit checks and other types of background checks can produce exactly this type of absurd barrier to employment. And things get worse when a rogue company violates what little protection the law offers.
Case in point: this week’s Federal Trade Commission (FTC) settlement with online data broker Spokeo.
Today, Spokeo describes itself as “a people search engine that organizes vast quantities of white-pages listings, social information, and other people-related data from a large variety of public sources.” But prior to 2010, the company had a very specific audience in mind for its mass of detailed data on individual Americans: employers. According to the FTC, Spokeo vigorously marketed its data profiles to human resources professionals and job recruiters as an employment screening tool. It lured recruiters through online advertising based on keywords like ""employment background checks,"" ""applicant screening,"" and ""recruiting,” and goaded recruiters to use its products to “explore beyond the resume.” If you wanted “credit estimates” on job applicants, or information about the investments, personal hobbies, ethnicity, religion or age of the people you were considering for employment, Spokeo was the place to get them.  
With all of the marketing come-ons and targeted appeals to recruiters, human resources professionals might have missed the little footnote stating that data from the site should not be used as a factor in determining an individual’s eligibility for employment, credit, or insurance. In other words, recruiters were meant to avoid using the information for exactly the purpose it had been sold for. And despite building a business based on assembling and selling consumer reports, Spokeo insisted that it was not, in fact, a consumer reporting agency, and so wasn’t covered by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). The company also didn’t tell employers that they were obligated under the terms of the FCRA to notify any job applicant whose dossier they viewed, share the information with them, and give them an opportunity to correct any inaccuracies. Finally, according to the FTC, Spokeo failed to ensure the accuracy of its reports.
Spokeo agreed to pay $800,000 to settle the complaint and was ordered to stop violating the law. With luck, the FTC’s action, its first case that deals with the sale of social media and other online data used for employment screening, will make other consumer reporting agencies think twice about violating the FCRA. And the real hero is the non-profit Center for Democracy and Technology, which in 2010 submitted the complaint against Spokeo that launched the FTC investigation.
But the settlement fails to settle some troubling issues. Why should recruiters and human resources personnel be presented with information about a job applicant’s ethnicity, age, or religion when it is illegal under civil rights laws to make employment decisions based on this information? For that matter, why should employers seek information on personal credit history? As I’ve argued before, although using personal credit history to make employment decisions is currently legal under the FCRA, this information can also have a disproportionate impact on groups protected under civil rights law and has not been proven relevant to employment. It’s not clear that Spokeo was providing any value to employers.
Finally, what about the job applicants who might have missed out on job opportunities because of irrelevant or inaccurate information in a Spokeo report? While the decision may prevent future violations of the law, it does nothing to make those who were impacted whole. In fact, the injured parties will never know they were harmed.",blog
"I was almost a member of the United Auto Workers union. At the turn of the millennium, I was a graduate student working as a teaching assistant at Columbia University. While I had expected the low pay, the arbitrariness of some university decisions making left me eager for a greater voice at work. I joined other graduate student workers organizing with UAW Local 2110, which ably represents the office and administrative employees at the university. But it was not to be. The university said the work we did – grading papers, holding office hours with students, reviewing exams and teaching –  wasn’t really “work” at all. Never mind that 280 undergraduate courses at Columbia were taught by graduate teaching assistants – we were not employees and were ineligible for unionization.  The National Labor Relations Board thought otherwise and ordered a union election: the ballots were impounded and never counted. Then, overseen by new Bush appointees, the NLRB reversed itself and decided we weren’t employees after all.
The fight lasted far beyond my time as a Columbia graduate student and employee, and today Columbia graduate workers still don’t have a union. But grad students employed at the other end of Manhattan at New York University soon will. 
Earlier this week 1,200 teaching and research assistants at NYU and the Polytechnic Institute of NYU in Brooklyn voted on unionization  following a voluntary agreement between the UAW and the university. According to the Chronicle of Higher Education, the vote was overwhelmingly in favor of joining the union.
NYU’s decision to allow a vote and refrain from interfering with its graduate workers’ choice is tremendously encouraging. NYU fought its graduate student workers (and the legitimacy of the union the school had previously recognized) for eight years – long enough in many disciplines to finish even the notoriously long process of Ph.D. course work and a dissertation – but it’s never too late to do the right thing. Graduate students learn a tremendous amount in the process of acting as teaching and research assistants, but the work they do also enables multi-billion dollar universities to function on a daily basis. It’s about time this work was recognized for what it is and employees won the right to organize and bargain collectively. Someday, the National Labor Relations Board may come around to that view again.
In the mean time, if you see an NYU teaching assistant, congratulate her. She’s likely been working hard.",blog
"The combination of predatory lending and predatory-employment practices has a historical precedent in the sharecropping system that kept formerly enslaved black families in the South trapped in a cycle of debt. Since most sharecroppers did not have a steady cash flow, they used their prospective crops as collateral to finance loans from the country store, a merchant who faced little competition and could therefore set interest rates as high as 50 or 60 percent. White store merchants and landlords built their own wealth on a system that left predominantly black sharecroppers in perpetual debt.
Like that system, Marriott’s employment instability and its credit union’s high-fee loans are fueling growing racial inequality. Indeed, Marriott’s mostly black and Latino front-line workforce may be particularly vulnerable to high-cost lending at MEFCU because of the long history of families of color being excluded from the wealth-building opportunities that have benefited white families. As a result, people of color remain less likely to have savings to fall back on when work hours are cut. They become more exposed to predatory lending, which in turn strips additional resources from families and communities, further increasing their reliance on borrowing in the future.

"Public policies can either fuel or ease racial disparities in wealth. This report marks the first-ever systematic analysis of the impact of different policies on the racial wealth gap.
As the United States rapidly becomes both a more diverse and unequal nation, policymakers face the urgent challenge of confronting growing wealth gaps by race and ethnicity. To create a more equitable and secure future, we must shift away from public policies that fuel and exacerbate racial disparities in wealth. But which policies can truly begin to reduce our country’s expanding racial divergences?
Until now there has been no systematic analysis of the types of public policies that offer the most potential for reducing the racial wealth gap. This paper pioneers a new tool, the Racial Wealth AuditTM, and uses it to evaluate the impact of housing, education, and labor markets on the wealth gap between white, Black, and Latino households and assesses how far policies that equalize outcomes in these areas could go toward reducing the gap. Drawing on data from the nationally representative Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) collected in 2011, the analysis tests how current racial disparities in wealth would be projected to change if key contributing factors to the racial wealth gap were equalized. 
To effectively address the increasing inequality that is undermining Americans’ economic security, we must first identify the key factors contributing to the problem and evaluate policy proposals that could affect current trends. The Racial Wealth Audit is designed to fill the void in our understanding of the factors contributing to the racial wealth gap and clarify our ability to reduce the gap through policy. This paper, which presents the first analyses using this new tool, will be followed by a series of policy briefs using the Racial Wealth Audit to analyze specific public policies and policy proposals.
 
America is becoming both a more diverse nation and a more unequal one. Over the past four decades, wealth inequality has skyrocketed, with nearly half of all wealth accumulation since 1986 going to the top 0.1 percent of households. Today the portion of wealth shared by the bottom 90 percent of Americans is shrinking, while the top 1 percent controls 42 percent of the nation’s wealth.1 At the same time, an increasing share of the American population is made up of people of color, and wealth is starkly divided along racial lines: the typical Black household now possesses just 6 percent of the wealth owned by the typical white household and the typical Latino household owns only 8 percent of the wealth held by the typical white household.2 These wealth disparities are rooted in historic injustices and carried forward by practices and policies that fail to reverse inequitable trends. As a result, racial wealth disparities, like wealth inequality overall, continue to grow.
Political thinkers increasingly recognize that rapidly growing inequality threatens economic stability and growth. But in a country where people of color will be a majority by mid-century, any successful push to reduce inequality must also address the structural racial inequities that hold back so many Americans. To create a more equitable future, we must confront the nation’s growing racial wealth gap and the public policies that continue to fuel and exacerbate it.
Stratospheric riches on the scale of the wealthiest Americans will never be accessible to the vast majority. Yet access to some degree of wealth is critical for every family’s economic security. Wealth functions as a financial safety net that enables families to deal with unexpected expenses and disruptions of income without accumulating large amounts of debt. At the same time, wealth can improve the prospects of the next generation through inheritances or gifts. Intergenerational transfers of wealth can play a pivotal role in helping to finance higher education, supply a down payment for a first home, or offer start-up capital for launching a new business.3 Because households of color have less wealth today, Black and Latino young adults are far less likely than young white people to receive a large sum—or any money at all—from family members to make these investments in their future.4 The result is that the racial wealth gap perpetuates from generation to generation, with profound implications for the economic security and mobility of future generations. 
The racial wealth gap is reinforced by federal policies that largely operate to increase wealth for those who already possess significant assets. The Corporation for Enterprise Development finds that more than half of the $400 billion provided annually in federal asset-building subsidies—policies intended to promote homeownership, retirement savings, economic investment and access to college—flow to the wealthiest 5 percent of taxpaying households.5 Meanwhile, the bottom 60 percent of taxpayers receive only 4 percent of these benefits and the bottom 20 percent of taxpayers receive almost nothing. Black and Latino households are disproportionately among those receiving little or no benefit. Unless key policies are restructured, the racial wealth gap—and wealth inequality in general—will continue to grow.
In this paper, we assess the major factors contributing to the racial wealth gap, considering how public policies around housing, education, and labor markets impact the distribution of wealth by race and ethnicity. Each factor is evaluated using a new tool: the Racial Wealth Audit developed by the Institute on Assets and Social Policy (IASP) to assess the impact of public policy on the wealth gap between white and Black and Latino households with the aim of guiding policy development. The Racial Wealth Audit draws on a baseline of representative data discussed in this paper to provide an empirical foundation for existing wealth among groups and the major determinants of wealth accumulation. For more information on the primary data source–the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP)—and the analysis techniques used in this study, please see the Appendix.
In this report, we briefly discuss the historic and policy roots of the wealth gap in each area and quantify the extent to which each policy area contributes to the current gap. Next, we look at the extent to which changes in housing, education, and labor market trends would affect the wealth gap—for example, the wealth impact of increasing the rate of Black and Latino homeownership to match white homeownership rates, and the impact of increasing the wealth returns that households of color receive as a result of homeownership to match white returns. We note policy ideas for reducing the racial wealth gap in each area.6
The greatest utility of the Racial Wealth Audit is evident in this policy analysis. From the starting position of existing disparities, the Audit predicts wealth increases or decreases for affected populations according to the components of a proposed policy. The Audit uses the most conservative assumptions possible, avoiding overstating changes in the gap. Finally, the Audit provides insight into the impact of policies on the racial wealth gap within a discrete time period, such as 1 year or 5 years ahead.
The Racial Wealth Audit is designed to fill the void in our understanding of the racial wealth gap and enhance our ability to reduce the gap through policy. It is an essential new measurement framework for assessment to facilitate informed decisions about the role of policy in asset-building, economic stability, and the racial wealth gap. Equally important, it can prevent the unintended side effects of policies that are not explicitly aimed at household wealth or financial disparities, yet contribute to worsening inequality. For more on the Racial Wealth Audit see IASP’s 2014 paper, The Racial Wealth Audit: Measuring How Policies Shape the Racial Wealth Gap.
 
In this report, we define the racial wealth gap as the absolute difference in wealth holdings between the median household among populations grouped by race or ethnicity. In the U.S. the racial wealth gap shows that the typical white household holds multiple times the wealth of Black and Latino households. Using the SIPP, we estimate that the median white household had $111,146 in wealth holdings in 2011, compared to $7,113 for the median Black household and $8,348 for the median Latino household.
In relative terms, Black households hold only 6 percent of the wealth owned by white households, which amounts to a total wealth gap of $104,033, and Latino households hold only 8 percent of the wealth owned by white households, a wealth gap of $102,798 (see Figure 1). In other words, a typical white family owns $15.63 for every $1 owned by a typical Black family, and $13.33 for every $1 owned by a typical Latino family.
This report analyzes data on white, Black, and Latino households. The terms Black and white are used to refer to the representative respondents of a household who identified as non-Latino Black or white in the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). Latinos include everyone who identified as Hispanic or Latino and may be of any race. 
Throughout this report, we use the term “racial wealth gap” to refer to the absolute differences in wealth (assets minus debt)7 between Black and white households as well as between Latino and white households. All dollar figures are in 2011 dollars.
 
For most families in the U.S., home equity marks the largest segment in their wealth portfolio; however, home ownership is unequally distributed by racial and ethnic lines. Disparities in homeownership rates (73 percent of whites as compared to 47 percent of Latinos and 45 percent of Blacks [see Figure 2]), typical home equity ($86,800 for white homeowners at the median as compared to $50,000 for Black homeowners and $48,000 for Latino homeowners)8, and neighborhood values where whites and people of color live substantially contribute to the racial wealth gap. In addition, tracing the same households over 25 years revealed that the number of years a household owned their home explained 27 percent of the growing racial wealth gap.9 Because white families are more likely to receive inheritances and other family assistance to put a down payment on a home, they are often able to start acquiring home equity many years earlier than Black and Latino families, offering a valuable head start on wealth-building.10
This section will explore the factors contributing to homeownership disparities in greater depth, and will analyze how equalizing rates of homeownership and returns to homeownership between whites, Blacks, and Latinos would each impact the racial wealth gap. We note that because the disparity in rates and returns to homeownership operate simultaneously to impair wealth building among households of color, policies that only address one aspect will not solve the entire portion of the racial wealth gap driven by homeownership.
Lower homeownership rates among Blacks and Latinos have many roots, ranging from lasting legacies of past policies to disparate access to real estate ownership. The National Housing Act of 1934, for example, redlined entire Black neighborhoods, marking them as bad credit risks and effectively discouraging lending in these areas, even as Black home buyers continued to be excluded from white neighborhoods. While redlining was officially outlawed by the Fair Housing Act of 1968, its impact in the form of residential segregation patterns persists with households of color more likely to live in neighborhoods characterized by higher poverty rates, lower home values, and a declining infrastructure compared to neighborhoods inhabited predominantly by white residents.
Discriminatory lending practices persist to this day. When households of color access mortgages, they are more often underwritten by higher interest rates.11 Mainstream lending institutions were deeply implicated in discriminatory lending: in 2012 Wells Fargo Bank admitted that they steered thousands of Black and Latino borrowers into subprime mortgages when non-Hispanic white borrowers with similar credit profiles received prime loans.12 In addition, the proliferation of high-cost credit options such as payday lenders in many neighborhoods of color, combined with the scarcity of banks and credit unions, is another likely contributor to weak credit. The fact that Black and Latino families are more likely to have taken on subprime mortgages in recent years contributed significantly to the devastating impact of the housing collapse that began in 2006. 
In addition to these longstanding homeownership and home equity disparities, the foreclosure crisis during the Great Recession of 2007-2008 dipped even further into families of color’s housing wealth. While the median white family lost 16 percent of their wealth in the housing crash and Great Recession, Black families lost 53 percent and Latino families lost 66 percent.13 Foreclosures both directly destroy housing wealth and have a lasting negative impact on credit, ensuring that mortgages and other loans will be offered on more costly terms in the future. 
While homeownership plays a central part in building family wealth in the United States, the nation’s public policies have systematically operated to shut Black and Latino families out of numerous opportunities to build housing wealth that benefitted white families. Today, Latinos and Blacks are less likely to own their homes and accrue less wealth, at the median, as a result of homeownership than white families. The next two sections use empirical estimates to explore impacts on the racial wealth gap if these disparities were eliminated.
We tested the effects of equalizing homeownership rates among white, Black, and Latino families on the racial wealth gap. Our model looks at wealth accumulation by race and ethnicity if the existing home owning population among Black and Latino households matched the 73 percent rate of white families. In other words, what if Black and Latino homeowners made up 73 percent of each of their respective population subgroups, without changing typical home values for whites or households of color? The model did not control for other characteristics that might distinguish homeowners from non-homeowners.
The results suggest that equalizing homeownership rates has substantial effects on the wealth accumulation of Black and Latino households. Median wealth among Black households rose from $7,113 to $39,226—adding $32,113 to the median Black household’s wealth (see Figure 3). Median wealth among Latino households rose from $8,348 to $37,561—adding $29,213 to the median Latino household’s wealth. Those numbers represent a 451 percent wealth increase for Black households, and a 350 percent wealth gain for Latino households. 
 
Equalizing Black and Latino homeownership rates with those of whites raises wealth among Black and Latino families, and substantially reduces the racial wealth gap. The wealth gap between white and Black families decreases by $32,113 to $71,920. This is a 31 percent reduction in the Black-white wealth gap. The wealth gap between white and Latino families decreases by $29,213 to $73,585, or a reduction of 28 percent (see Figure 4).  
We tested the effects on the racial wealth gap of changing the wealth return on homeownership to Black and Latino households to equalize the return to homeownership for white households. The first step in this model estimates the wealth returns to homeownership using a multivariate median regression model for the white population. That model estimates that white households benefit from a $96,248 return on with homeownership. 
Using a similar model to estimate the wealth effects of homeownership on Black households, we find that the wealth returns to homeownership for Black households amount to $71,715—just 75 percent of the returns that accrue to white households (see Figure 5). This difference of $24,533 means that for every $1 in wealth that a Black family builds as a result of homeownership, white families accrue $1.34.14 Meanwhile, the wealth returns to homeownership for Latino households amount to $62,647—just 65 percent of the returns that accrue to white households. This difference of $33,601 means that for every $1 in wealth that accrues to Latino families as a result of homeownership, white families accrue $1.54. 
In order to construct a model that equalizes the returns to homeownership across groups, we assigned home equity at the rate accumulating to the median white household—$96,248—to Black and Latino households with home equity values less than that threshold. This assignment raises Black and Latino wealth by the difference between their existing median equity and the white median. 
As a result of equalizing the return to Black homeownership to the level of return that accrues to whites, Black families’ median wealth grew by $17,113 to $24,226—a 241 percent increase in median Black household wealth (see Figure 6). As a result of equalizing the return to homeownership among Latinos to the level of return that accrues to whites, Latino families’ median wealth grew by $41,652 to $50,000—a 499 percent increase in Latino median wealth. 
 
Equalizing wealth returns to homeownership raised wealth among Black and Latino families while white wealth was held constant, significantly reducing the racial wealth gap. Equalizing the returns to homeownership reduces the wealth gap between white and Black families by $17,133 to $86,920. This is a 16 percent reduction in the Black-white wealth gap (see Figure 7). Meanwhile the wealth gap between white and Latino families decreases by $41,652 to $61,146—a reduction of 41 percent. 
 
Positing Black and Latino homeownership rates and returns equal to those of white families helps to clarify the contours of the racial wealth gap, but it’s quite different from having policy proposals that would actually accomplish these aims—or even approach them. Yet just as past and continuing policies have helped to shape the distribution of wealth in America today, policy change could alter the existing trends for better or worse. A bold, comprehensive approach would be required to move us towards the level of equality in homeownership modeled in our analyses; however, a number of policy efforts could bring us closer to expanding opportunities to build wealth through homeownership in the U.S. While far from a comprehensive list, here are three sample homeownership policies that could help to build housing wealth for people of color and shrink the racial wealth gap.
Attaining a college education has never been more important to a household’s ability to thrive in the labor market, attain financial stability, and build wealth. Today, more students than ever before are entering 4-year colleges. However, despite rising college attendance rates among Black and Latino households, barriers to completing a degree have actually widened the college attainment gap between whites and people of color over the past decade. In 2011, 34 percent of whites completed a four-year college degree, compared to just 20 percent of Blacks and 13 percent of Latinos (see Figure 8).16 One key barrier is the rapid growth in college costs, which forces households to take on significant debt in order to attend institutions of higher education—even in cases where students do not ultimately graduate. Gaps in college attainment by race and ethnicity also reflect other inequities in the K-12 education system and in household income. 
 
In addition to attainment gaps, the returns to college education differ across racial and ethnic groups. At the median, a white family sees a return of $55,869 in wealth from completing a four-year college degree, while the median Black and Latino families attain just a small fraction of this return: $4,846 and $4,191 respectively. The returns to Black and Latino families are impacted by, among other things, their greater need to take on debt to pay for college and their disparate experiences in the labor market after graduation. According to previous research from IASP, differences in college completion rates accounted for about 5 percent of the growth in the racial wealth gap over a 25 year period (1984-2011). 
This section looks more closely at the factors contributing to disparities in higher education, and evaluates how equalizing rates of college completion (defined as graduating with a four-year degree) and returns to college completion between whites, Blacks, and Latinos would each impact the racial wealth gap. 
 
Public policy decisions are critical to understanding why Latinos and Blacks are less likely to have completed a four-year college degree than whites, as well as why Latino and Black graduates build less wealth as a result of their degrees. Educational inequities have deep historical roots in policies that prohibited slaves from learning to read and the century of substandard “separate but equal” educational facilities that followed, leaving many students of color poorly prepared for college. These past educational inequities matter today because parents’ educational level—as well as family incomes and wealth itself—significantly predict children’s educational success across their lifetimes.17 At the same time, contemporary policy choices, from the retreat from integration in K-12 education to the declining public support for affordable higher education, shape the educational opportunities available to youth of color who are more likely to need financial support for college, thereby contributing to the existing racial wealth gap. 
Disparities in education begin early in the lives of children in the U.S. and current education policies often foster inequities. 18 The policy decision not to invest in quality preschool education for all young people sets the stage for racial disparities that persist throughout the educational system from K-12 to higher education. While quality K-12 education is essential for college readiness, residential segregation leaves many Black and Latino students, particularly those from low-income families, concentrated in low-quality, under-resourced schools. As policy has shifted away from efforts to integrate public education that prevailed after the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision in 1954, research has documented dramatic increases in segregation, with Black and Latino students increasingly attending the same schools.19 Predominantly Black and Latino schools spend less per student than predominantly white schools, a disparity that is only partly accounted for by the different property-tax bases of school districts creating a highly unequal educational system across the country.20
Once students reach college, racial and ethnic disparities in family economic resources and the soaring costs of attending college mean that students of color often confront unsustainable expenses as they pursue higher education, leading to huge debt burdens and lower graduation rates. At public institutions, increasing tuition and fees are primarily a result of declining state support for higher education shifting a greater share of the costs to students.21 As a result, Black and Latino students, with less family wealth than white students are more likely to struggle with higher costs, seek out less expensive schools, work excessive hours, reduce study time to work, and/or take on more student loan debt.22
For young people who come from families without substantial wealth, education has long been seen as the pathway to greater opportunity and economic security. However rather than facilitating economic mobility, according to our analyses, current educational inequalities end up being a small, direct net contributor to the racial wealth gap. In addition, it is also likely influencing a number of other variables that shape unequal asset-building opportunities. The next two sections present our empirical analysis exploring how the racial wealth gap would change if educational disparities were reduced.
 
We tested the effects of equalizing college graduation rates among white, Black, and Latino families on the racial wealth gap. This test did not control for other characteristics that might distinguish those who finish college from those who do not. Instead, it looks at wealth accumulation by race and ethnicity if the proportion of Black and Latino households with a college degree matched the 34 percent college completion rate of whites. 
Compared to the effects of changes in homeownership rates on the racial wealth gap, the effects of changing college attainment rates on household wealth for Black and Latino families are modest. Median wealth among Black households rises from $7,113 to $8,426—adding $1,313 to the median Black household’s wealth (see Figure 9). Median wealth among Latino households rises from $8,348 to $11,876—adding $3,528 to the median Latino household’s wealth. Those gains represent an 18 percent wealth increase for Black households, and a 42 percent wealth increase for Latino households. 
The equalization of college graduation rates raised wealth among Black and Latino families while white wealth was held constant, modestly reducing the racial wealth gap. The wealth gap between white and Black families was reduced by $1,313, which amounts to just 1 percent of the racial wealth gap (see Figure 10). The wealth gap between white and Latino families was reduced by $3,528, a reduction of 3 percent. 
 
The fact that the reduction in the racial wealth gap from equalizing college graduation rates is small does not automatically imply that raising educational attainment is an ineffective means of closing the racial wealth gap. Instead, it suggests that matching the current levels of college degree attainment of white households—in which the benefits of a four-year college degree reach only about a third of households—is unlikely to substantially reduce the wealth gap.
 
Next, we tested the effects on the racial wealth gap of changing the return on completing a four-year college degree for Black and Latino households to equal the return to graduation of white households. As seen above, the first step in this process estimates the wealth returns to a college degree using a multivariate median regression model for the white population. That model estimates that white households benefit from a wealth return of $55,869 associated with college graduation.
In analyzing the experiences of Black households, the wealth returns to a college education for Black households amount to just $4,846—only 9 percent of the returns that accrue to white households (see Figure 11). This difference of $51,023 means that for every $1 in wealth that accrues to Black families associated with a college degree at the median, white families accrue $11.49. Meanwhile, the wealth returns to a college education for Latino households amount to $4,191—just 8 percent of what accrues to white households. This difference of $51,678 means that for every $1 in wealth that accrues to Latino families from a college education, white families accrue $13.33. 
 
In order to construct a model equalizing the returns to a college education across groups, we assigned Black and Latino households that had completed college with a value of total wealth equal to the return to college graduation for the median white household: $55,869. Black and Latino college graduates who already had household wealth above this value did not have their wealth adjusted. This change does not alter the differential rates of college graduation and thus affects only a subset of the Black and Latino populations.
As a result of equalizing the return to a college education to the level of return accruing to whites, Black families’ median wealth grows by $10,786 to $17,899—a 152 percent increase in Black household wealth (see Figure 12). As a result of equalizing the return to a college education to the level of return accruing to whites, Latino families’ median wealth grows by $5,878 to $14,226—a 70 percent increase in Latino wealth. 
The equalization of returns to a college education raises the medial level of wealth among Black and Latino families, while white median wealth remains constant, modestly reducing the racial wealth gap. Equalizing the returns to a college education reduces the wealth gap between white and Black families by $10,786 to $93,247. This is a 10 percent reduction in the Black-white wealth gap (see Figure 13). Meanwhile, the wealth gap between white and Latino families decreases by $5,878 to $96,920—a reduction of 6 percent. 
 
One reason the reduction in the racial wealth gap is modest when the return to college education is equalized is because the affected households—the 20 percent of Blacks and 13 percent of Latinos that have attained a four-year college degree—is a relatively small proportion of the overall Black and Latino population. Raising college completion rates at the same time that the returns to a college degree increase would be expected to impact a greater number of households and to decrease the racial wealth gap more significantly. 
 
Disparities in attaining a college education account for only a small portion of the racial wealth gap. Our findings suggest that increasing college completion rates among Black and Latino youth and improving their returns on a college degree would reduce the wealth gap only modestly at the median. Nevertheless, a number of promising education policies do show potential to make a difference in shrinking racial wealth disparities. The following sample policies are not a comprehensive list:
American households derive much of their economic security from the labor market, with earned income, employer-provided health coverage, paid leave, and workplace retirement plans offering greater opportunities to build wealth for the employees who have access. The greater a household’s income, for example, the more money household members have to save and invest. Meanwhile if an employer provides an affordable health insurance plan, employees often spend less than if they had to purchase their own coverage or risk incurring substantial medical expenses that can drain wealth. Pensions and 401(k)-type plans with an employer contribution offer a mechanism for employers to contribute directly to household wealth, adding to retirement savings. Yet labor markets are one of the primary drivers of the racial wealth gap, accounting for 20 percent of its growth in the last 25 years.23 In addition, unemployment, which causes many families to draw on and deplete their assets, explains an additional 9 percent of the growth in the racial wealth gap. 
Disparities in labor market outcomes arise from a variety of sources, including employment discrimination, lack of geographic access to jobs, and disparate social capital. Income disparities affect both current consumption and wealth building opportunities. Median Black and Latino families have lower incomes than white families: while the typical white family makes $50,400 a year, the typical Latino family makes just $36,840 and the typical Black family has an annual income of only $32,028 (see Figure 14). 
 
In addition to lower incomes, Black and Latino families also see less of a wealth return on the incomes they earn—in effect, they are less able to translate each additional dollar of income into wealth. For each dollar in income white families earn, they see a return of $19.51, compared to a return of only $4.80 on each dollar for Black families and just $3.63 for Latino families. A number of labor market dynamics contribute to these disparities: Blacks and Latinos are less likely to have jobs that include core employer-provided benefits such as health coverage, a retirement plan, or paid time off. As a result, families of color have fewer opportunities to save because they must use their current income to deal with more of life’s vicissitudes. Similarly, Black workers have higher rates of unemployment and longer average unemployment spells, which drains wealth and adds to labor market instability. 
The following section will more closely consider the factors that contribute to disparities in labor market outcomes and assesses how equalizing family incomes and returns to income (the ability to translate a dollar of income into wealth) between whites, Blacks, and Latinos would impact the racial wealth gap. 
 
Racial and ethnic inequality in American labor markets was codified and maintained by law for much of U.S. history. It was not until the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that federal law prohibited job discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, and national origin. Yet public policy decisions—from the enduring exclusion of certain job categories to the protections of the Fair Labor Standards Act to immigration laws that inhibit workers from exercising their full rights in the workplace—continue to shape the U.S. labor market in ways that systematically disadvantage Blacks and Latinos, helping to explain why people of color bring in lower incomes and receive lower wealth returns than white families. 
For most Americans, the vast majority of income comes from a paycheck. Black and Latino workers are not only paid less, but are also more likely to be employed in jobs that fail to offer key benefits such as health coverage, paid leave, or retirement plans. The disparity in benefits helps to explain why families of color accrue less of a return on each dollar of wealth earned than white families: Blacks and Latinos are more likely to pay for necessities like health care out-of-pocket and therefore, to have less to save and invest for the future. This also means that households of color are more likely to miss out on the tax incentives and wealth-building vehicles provided by employer benefits 
Why don’t Black and Latino workers simply move into better-paying jobs? The lower rates of college degree completion discussed previously is one important factor. However, white workers with and without college degrees out-earn their Black and Latino counterparts with similar levels of education. The persistence of job discrimination is a critical part of the explanation for the lower incomes of Black and Latino workers. Here the problem is partly a failure of effective policy enforcement: employment discrimination on the basis of race or national origin has been illegal for decades, yet there is substantial research evidence that it endures, whether through overt bigotry or implicit bias.24 In addition, since Americans lead largely segregated lives, whites disproportionately benefit from social networking advantages.25 Because networks reproduce racial wealth inequalities, public policy interventions are required to disrupt this cycle. 
For the Latino workforce in particular, immigration policy is a barrier to better jobs and higher incomes. While the nation’s worker protection laws officially extend to all employees regardless of immigration status, in practice immigrant workers face barriers to exercising their rights in the workplace, resulting in lower earnings. Limited English, lack of familiarity with the U.S. labor market, and concern about immigration status may also encourage immigrant workers to remain in occupations and industries they are familiar with, even if these jobs pay less and offer fewer benefits.
With the exception of those who are already very wealthy, Americans need good jobs to build assets. Yet, policy choices have contributed to the segregation of labor markets, both reducing the incomes of Black and Latino workers compared to whites and reducing the ability of people of color to turn additional income gains into wealth. As a result, labor market disparities are one of the primary contributors to the racial wealth gap. The next two sections highlight our empirical analysis exploring how the racial wealth gap would change if incomes and returns on income were more equal.
 
We tested the effects of eliminating income disparities among white, Black, and Latino families on the racial wealth gap by equalizing the patterns of household income distribution by race and ethnicity. In the current income distribution, white families are disproportionately likely to be at the top while Black and Latino families are overrepresented among lower income households . For our analysis, we estimated the income distribution of the white population alone and identified the thresholds for each income decile (for example, the top ten percent of white households in terms of income, the next ten percent after that, and so on); we then assigned weights to the Black and Latino households that appear in each decile of the white distribution until those households represent 10 percent of the Black and Latino populations. This test did not control for other characteristics that might distinguish those in any particular decile. In other words, we shifted the number of estimated households across the income distribution such that whites, Blacks, and Latinos were represented across the income distribution in equal proportions to their presence in the overall population. 
As a result of the redistribution, median wealth among Black households rises from $7,113 to $18,601—adding $11,488 to the median Black household’s wealth (see Figure 15). Median wealth among Latino households rises from $8,348 to $17,113—adding $8,765 to the median Latino household’s wealth. Those gains represent a 162 percent wealth gain for Black households, and a 105 percent wealth gain for Latino households. 
 
Equalizing Black and Latino incomes to match the white income distribution increases wealth among Black and Latino families who see higher incomes, while white wealth remains constant, modestly reducing the racial wealth gap. The wealth gap between white and Black families was decreases by $11,488, but leaves a remaining gap of $92,545. The change amounts to 11 percent of the racial wealth gap (see Figure 16). The wealth gap between white and Latino families decreases by $8,765, leaving a racial wealth gap of $94,033. The change in the racial wealth gap as a result of equalizing the income distribution is 9 percent. 
We also tested the effects of changing the return to an additional $1 of income for Black and Latino households to equal the return for white households. The first step in this model estimates the wealth returns to an additional $1 of income using a median regression model for the white population. That model estimates that white households experience a return of $19.51 in wealth on each additional dollar in income. 
The wealth return to an additional dollar of income for Black households amount to $4.80—only 25 percent of the returns that accrue to white households. This means that for every dollar in wealth that accrues to Black families associated with higher incomes, a white family gets $4.06 (see Figure 17). Meanwhile, the wealth returns to an additional dollar of income for Latino households amount to $3.63—19 percent of the return for whites. This means that for every dollar in wealth that accrues to Latino families associated with higher incomes, a white family typically gets $5.37.
 
Improving Black families’ return to an additional dollar of income to equal whites’ returns increases Black families’ wealth by $44,963 to a total of $52,076—a 632 percent increase in Black household wealth. Meanwhile, equalizing Latino families’ returns to an additional dollar of income boosts Latino wealth by $51,552 to a total of $59,900—a 618 percent increase in Latino household wealth. 
Equalizing returns to an additional dollar of income raises wealth among Black and Latino families while white wealth remains constant, substantially reducing the racial wealth gap. Equalizing the returns to income reduces the wealth gap between white and Black families by $44,963 to a total of $59,070 (see Figure 18). This is a 43 percent reduction in the Black-white wealth gap (see Figure 19). Meanwhile, the wealth gap between white and Latino families is reduced by $51,552 to a total of $51,246—a reduction of 50 percent. 
The range of labor market policies that could boost job quality for Black and Latino workers—raising wages, improving benefits, and offering more opportunities for career advancement—is extensive, even before we consider measures to reduce unemployment and increase the ability to turn income into wealth. Below is a sample of three policies with the potential to shrink the racial wealth gap from income and labor market outcomes. The list is far from comprehensive.
When it comes to tackling the racial wealth gap, policies matter tremendously. Simply increasing rates of Black and Latino achievement (whether it is homeownership, college graduation, or income parity) is not sufficient to fully eliminate the gaps in wealth between Black and Latino families and their white counterparts. In almost every case, equalizing the returns to any given achievement makes a greater difference for the racial wealth gap than eliminating disparities in home purchases, college graduation rates, or wages. The challenge is that improving the economic returns that households gain requires confronting and changing the deeply entrenched structures discussed throughout this paper— from residential segregation to jobs that lack the benefits that enable households to build assets. Policymakers must act both to remove barriers to access and achievement and also challenge the deeply-rooted structures that reproduce disproportionate advantages for white households. 
Our results suggest that policies that successfully address disparities in homeownership rates and returns to income are likely to be the most effective in reducing the racial wealth gap. At the same time, policy details matter. As policymakers craft proposals and evaluate legislation, the Racial Wealth Audit will be a valuable tool for understanding how policy impacts one of the most pressing questions of our time—the nation’s growing economic divergence along racial and ethnic lines.
 
The Racial Wealth Audit (RWA) analyses in this study utilize the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) 2008 Panel, Wave 10 from calendar year 2011. A nationally representative survey conducted by the Census Bureau, the SIPP includes rich information on survey participants’ household income, demographic characteristics, and participation into and out of government social programs, such as ‘Temporary Assistance for Needy Families’ (TANF). The SIPP is a panel survey following the same households for 2.5 to four years; the first panel was started in 1968. Each panel includes a large number of rotating waves with a diverse range of sub-topics. Wave 10 of the 2008 panel was chosen for our analyses because it includes the most recent comprehensive data on household assets.
 
In order to model changes to the racial wealth gap under circumstances in which the rates of key wealth achievements are equalized by race and ethnicity, we shifted the distribution of households for each race/ethnicity subgroup using a reweighting technique in order to equalize the proportion households who have obtained a specific wealth asset, such as homeownership. In other words, in the case of homeownership, we increased the population weights of existing Black and Latino homeowners in the survey, such that they made up an equal portion of their respective subgroups as white homeowners make up among all whites. To present a simplified example, if the proportion of homeowners to renters among whites was 3/4, and 1/2 for Blacks, then this approach would reweight Blacks in the SIPP survey who own their homes from 1/2 to 3/4 of the entire Black sample population, and Black renters from 1/2 to 1/4 of the black sample population. Under this reweighted scenario, the ratio of Black homeowners to renters becomes equal to the existing current ratio of white homeowners to renters. This method keeps all other characteristics, including demographics within the Black homeowner population and Black renter population, respectively, constant. Since the reweighting technique does not apply any changes to the characteristics of the sample households in the survey, but rather shifts the proportions of particular households present in the population estimates, the method only changes the share of the sub-populations within the full population sample. 
The following equations depict the mathematical calculations used to develop new weights to adjust the homeownership rates of blacks to white levels:
 
The technique outlined here to develop new weights to equalize rates of homeownership is applied to all three policy areas discussed in this report and for Blacks and Latinos. Because the SIPP household weights, which allow researchers to estimate all U.S. households, and our new weights are both probability weights, they can simply be multiplied to estimate the full U.S. population under the alternative scenarios we have envisioned in the three policy areas. For additional information on regression analysis with propensity scores, see ‘Weighting Regressions by Propensity Scores'.28
 
For our estimates of differences in returns to homeownership, college education, and household income, we conducted quantile regression (QR) analysis at the 50th percentile, also known as median regression, to estimate typical wealth gains experienced by families who attain these achievements. Explanatory dummy variables within comprehensive multivariate median regression models captured predicted typical gains, or “returns,” resulting from the realization of these key wealth factors at the median. Models were conducted separately among whites, Blacks, and Latinos in order to estimate differential returns to these assets experienced by whites and households of color.
The key difference between quantile regression and Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression is that the former calculates the outcomes of specific distribution percentiles, while the latter calculates estimates based on distribution means. QR is particularly important in the case of statistical predictions for distributions that are not normal, as it is the case with asset and wealth ownership. For example, an OLS regression model that calculates asset holding disparities between Blacks and whites will only predict averages (means) for both racial groups, thereby hiding important information about the within-group inequality. QR models solve this problem because they can be specified to different percentiles of the distribution, such as the median. In other words, they enable us to calculate predictions for wealth holdings among blacks and whites at every level of the distribution.
Until recently OLS has been the more dominant statistical approach because the calculations for quantile regressions were considered too tedious. However, strong increases in computing power over the last few decades make this argument less relevant today. Given that QR is a superior approach to explain relationships of variables that are highly skewed, as is the distribution of wealth in the United States, we used median regression, which allows us to predict the expected increase in wealth due to key factors at the median for white, Black and Latino households. While the regression models cannot provide causal associations, the returns to key factors represent an expected gain in wealth that is typically seen by households upon obtaining a particular asset.",research
"What would you do if you were laid off from a job? While you looked for a new position, you’d likely cut expenses as much as possible and begin drawing on any savings you have to pay the bills you can’t avoid. As time went on, you might turn to family, friends, and community institutions for assistance. With luck, you’d qualify for federal unemployment insurance benefits, and the $300 a week on average that they provide would be a critical support. At the same time, you might wind up putting groceries or gas on your credit card -- and then having trouble paying that bill. You wouldn’t be alone.
New findings from Demos’ 2012 National Survey on Credit Card Debt of Low and Middle-Income Households reveal that job loss is a leading contributor to credit card debt, and the debt accumulated can take years to pay off. A quarter of all low- and middle-income households with credit card debt reported that they had accumulated their debt as a result of a job loss. Among households with members who have been unemployed in the past three years, 34 percent say that expenses relating to job loss are the single biggest contributor to current credit card debt.
We also find that households with members who have been unemployed in the past three years have credit card balances that average $100 more than those who have not experienced household unemployment. Unemployed households also pay average credit card interest rates seven percent higher than households that haven’t been impacted by unemployment. Over time, higher rates can lead to thousands of dollars in extra interest payments—even on credit cards that have since been cancelled.
Since households experiencing unemployment are more likely to pay credit card bills late and have difficulty paying off other debts, they also tend to have worse credit. Having poor credit can impose higher costs and reduced economic opportunities for years to come: causing a consumer to end up paying more for loans and insurance, have difficulty renting an apartment, or even be turned down for a future job.
Americans shouldn’t have to rely on a “plastic safety net” of credit card debt to make ends meet – we should have a genuine, public safety net to provide support when we’ve fallen on hard times. Clearly the unemployment insurance system is failing to adequately sustain out-of-work Americans and should be strengthened. But instead, we face the danger of cuts.
If unemployed workers and their families need credit cards to make ends meet even when unemployment benefits are available, imagine how bad things could become if the benefits expired. As Ilana Novick noted on this blog last week, unemployment benefits for approximately 2.1 million Americans who have been out of work for more than six months are set to expire at the end of December unless Congress acts to extend them. There are many well-documented reasons to extend benefits: avoiding an increase in household indebtedness – with all of its long term consequences – is yet another.

"“Whatever executive authority I have to help the middle class, I’ll use it,” announced President Obama in last month’s landmark economic address in Galesburg Illinois. Now consensus seems to be building around one thing President Obama can indeed use his executive powers to do to boost hundreds of thousands of workers into the middle class: raise their wages.
The public has long supported raising the minimum wage for all working Americans and many economists agree that a broad minimum wage hike makes economic sense. But raising the federal minimum wage would require Congress to act. And as my colleague Joe Hines noted on PolicyShop this week, Congress is not exactly rushing to cater to the interests of the poor and low-wage workers.
So an executive action by President Obama is especially appealing. And while the President cannot unilaterally increase the minimum wage for everyone, he can change federal contracting procedures to favor contractors that pay their employees enough to live and raise a family on. This week, the New York Times published a powerful editorial calling on the President to do it. Drawing on a recent Demos study of low-wage contract employees and other federally-supported workers, as well as research from the National Employment Law Project, the Times made the case that:
Nearly 50 years after. . . President Johnson signed an executive order mandating nondiscrimination in employment by government contractors… [President Obama] could respond much as Mr. Johnson did — with an executive order aimed, this time, at raising the pay of millions of poorly paid employees of government contractors. . . challenging the notion that the best contractor is the one with the lowest labor costs.
Over at the Roosevelt Institute, Senior Fellow Richard Kirsch agrees,  pointing out that “In the 1930s, and again in the 1960s, the federal government helped raise wages for workers. Congress passed laws and presidents issued executive orders that required businesses with federal contracts to pay their workers their industry’s prevailing wage. That meant better pay.”
Jared Bernstein, former economic advisor to Vice President Joe Biden, says this is an “an executive order whose time has come.” And while Dr. Bernstein apologizes for bothering the President while he’s on vacation, the truth is that many of the federal contracting jobs in question don’t come with paid vacation days anymore than they pay a living wage.
The exact form an executive order should take is worth considering. Bernstein argues that:
procurement officers—the folks who decide which firms get the bid—should be able to factor job quality into their decision.  It’s that simple.  By law, they have to take the lowest bid, but that rule is of course conditional on the quality of the output, otherwise my kid could win the bid to build a bridge out of Legos. Well, there’s good evidence that the quality of the work is a function of the wage, working conditions, commitments to training, workforce tenure, and such characteristics that we see in high-road versus low-road employers. Simply allowing procurement officers to consider those characteristics when they’re deciding who gets the bid would improve the quality of work and the living standards of thousands of contracted workers.
As the Times points out (and we argued in our recent study) “Mr. Obama also could tell federal agencies to conduct reviews of contracts to see if the work should be done in-house.” What's more, an effort to raise wages for low-paid contract workers could be combined an order to stop contractors from discriminatory hiring based on sexual orientation or gender identity. If President Obama is serious about his willingness to use executive authority, he could accomplish a great deal. And if a growing chorus of policy experts and eminent newspapers can’t convince him to take action, workers themselves are likely to take to the streets again and demand a better deal.",blog
"In 2013, Walmart spent billions repurchasing shares of its own stock. It should have spent it raising wages.
Walmart investors committed to long-term firm performance would benefit from reallocating resources. If Walmart redirected the $6.6 billion spent on share repurchases in 2013 toward investment in human capital, it could give its 825,000 low-wage employees a raise of $5.13 per hour, boosting productivity and sales.
Impressive returns in the 1990s and billions of dollars in annual profit have positioned Walmart investors to expect a commitment to growth and financial performance from the company. Recently though, Walmart’s focus on returning value to shareholders through raising short-term earnings has diverted resources away from the kind of human capital investment that would lead to sustainable value creation in the long run. This brief explains how investors committed to long-term firm performance would benefit from reallocating resources to human capital management, raising productivity by reducing turnover and improving employee engagement, enhancing customer service, and building long-term value.
Last year, Walmart spent more than $6.6 billion repurchasing shares of its stock, bumping up earnings per share and consolidating ownership among the Walton family heirs. But the company’s performance slumped anyway as weak consumer demand, operational problems as a result of understaffing, and federal cuts to the food stamp program (a critical source of revenue for Walmart) undermined sales. Media and market analysts identified Walmart’s own human capital management practices as a central factor in execution failures at US stores.1
In an uncertain economy where households curtail even the most basic expenditures, Walmart has a unique opportunity to turn things around. As the world’s largest retailer and biggest employer, effective human capital management at Walmart would not only have benefits for the company, but create spillover effects supporting greater economic stability and growth. 
Walmart spends a sizable portion of its profits—$6.6 billion in 2013—on share repurchases that benefit an increasingly narrow group of owners and executives. Repurchases help the company meet earnings targets even when sales are down by reducing the number of shares on the market and lifting earnings for those that remain. But when buybacks are poorly timed or crowd out other investment, they can actually undermine longer-term goals.2 In a 2012 study, analysts at Credit Suisse showed that just 36 percent of S&P 500 companies performing share buybacks returned value to shareholders above the basic cost of equity.3 In Walmart’s case, even these massive financial maneuvers are increasingly insufficient to make up for listless company performance.4 Unproductive spending on share repurchases is displacing sustainable human capital management that would better align the interests of workers, managers, and shareholders in the company and materialize as greater revenue over time.
Walmart employs 825,000 workers who earn less than $25,000 per year, wages that leave many of the company’s workers and their families below the poverty line.5 Redirecting current investment in share repurchases toward human capital could mean a raise of $5.13 per hour for this low wage workforce. The results would be a significant raise in living standards for hundreds of thousands of households and an increase in US sales growth for the company. 
According to a growing body of research on human capital management in retail, experienced employees with broad knowledge of the company are better equipped to serve customers, leading to higher sales numbers and better performance overall.6 Research from management experts at the Wharton School of Business shows that stores see an average of $10 in new revenue for every additional dollar spent on payroll.7 Better staffing practices lead to higher sales, since customers can count on stocked shelves and knowledgeable employees. Investing in front-line services would increase consumer spending at Walmart’s own stores and improve company performance.
Walmart’s current pay practices have a negative impact on fundamental performance measures. In the retail market, customers’ brand perception is primarily formed by their experience with human capital outcomes. Last year, media reports of Walmart customers abandoning the store for competitors cited underinvestment in front-line services as the central cause, as workers were stretched too thin to accommodate the needs of patrons and keep inventory on the shelves.8
Walmart investors have also experienced first-hand how the low-wage economy thwarts performance. In 2013 sales at comparable US stores declined 0.5 percent and revenue growth fell drastically to 1.6 percent, down from 5 percent the year before.9 The company pointed to benefit cuts in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Plan (SNAP, or food stamps) in November and January as a catalyst to their falling profits and identified changes to the program as a notable risk for shareholders in their latest annual report.10 The company’s reliance on the food stamp program creates vulnerability in two ways. Millions of dollars in subsidies support the firm’s labor costs and enable Walmart to pay wages below the level necessary for workers and their families to survive. Dependence on public subsidies to finance the wage bill transfers the cost of maintaining a labor force onto taxpayers and externalizes the consequences of human capital management at the firm. Additionally, Walmart depends on a consumer base that spends more than $13 billion in SNAP benefits at the store each year.11 When customers—a population that includes Walmart’s own workforce—have to cut back on the basics, those cuts appear in the financial performance of the firm.
In a recent report, the consulting group Institutional Shareholders Services Inc (ISS) criticized Walmart for inadequate oversight concerning human capital management among the company’s Board of Directors.12 According to ISS, the Walton family heirs’ ownership control and the lack of an independent board has led to troubling executive pay practices and inadequate transparency surrounding shareholders’ legal risks. The ISS recommendation that shareholders vote no on the reappointment of two board members and the executive compensation package suggests that human capital management practices at Walmart are not aligned with shareholder interests. 
When firms like Walmart pay so little that workers cannot make ends meet, the negative effects of the company’s human capital management resound throughout the economy. With paychecks that fall short, families go without, businesses see lower sales numbers, hiring slows or sputters, and the economy gets stuck in a low-performing, vicious cycle. Walmart plays a significant role in perpetuating the low-wage economy because the pay practices at Walmart put downward pressure on wages at other businesses. According to research from the UC Berkeley Labor Center, retail wages fall 10 percent and health coverage declines when Walmart enters a market.13 That means that improving human capital investment at Walmart can have dual effects on the bottom line: improvements in productivity and customer service that lift sales, and positive effects on consumer spending among the company’s low-income customer base. 
The short-term focus of Walmart’s current business model undermines the company’s performance with negative implications for long-term sustainable value creation. The retailer’s outsized impact on broader markets means that those decisions are problematic for the US economy as a whole, but also demonstrate that Walmart has a unique opportunity to lead the way to a high-wage, high-performing economy with broadly shared gains from growth. This year, Walmart can break the vicious cycle of the low-wage economy by providing a productive boost to workers and its own bottom line through human capital investments that generate real returns. 
Despite growing vulnerability, disappointing sales results, and an economy that is still struggling to regain its course, founder Sam Walton’s heirs earned even more from their company ownership stake in 2013 than they did the year before. The Waltons are now majority owners in the firm, holding more than 50 percent of the company’s public shares and collecting dividend payments of more than $3 billion in total—a raise over their 2012 dividend earnings by more than $400 million. Yet while the Waltons already control more wealth than 40 percent of Americans combined, the workers who contribute to generating this wealth every day must often choose between buying food or keeping the electricity on.14 The divergent fortunes of these two sides of the Walmart family are a prime example of the way business decisions at the company fuel inequality and undermine broad economic stability and growth. 
The $3 billion spent in dividend payments to the Walmart heirs would amount to a raise of $2.38 per hour for Walmart’s 825,000 low-wage workers. ",research
"Demos’ new briefing book, Everyone’s Economy, offers an economic agenda that will enable all of us to thrive. Women’s History Month is an opportunity to dig into the ways that a race-conscious, populist economic agenda must elevate women. Over the next 2 weeks, Demos will share a series of blog posts that explore different ways that policy can impact women’s economic opportunity and stability. Today we look at how women benefit from fair employment policies.
We all deserve an equal opportunity to be hired based on our abilities, and to carry out our work free from discrimination and harassment. Yet discriminatory hiring, firing, promotions, and pay, as well as pervasive harassment, continue to shape the U.S. labor market in ways that systematically disadvantage women, people of color, LGBTQ workers, people with disabilities, and other targeted groups. As our jobs largely determine our incomes, economic opportunities, and the livelihood of our families, unfair employment practices worsen cycles of inequality.
Types of discrimination overlap and deepen inequality: For example, in 2016, Latina women working full-time, year-round were still paid only 54 cents for every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic men. Race and gender contribute to dramatic pay gaps across the spectrum, and gaps persist for workers at all levels of education and in the vast majority of occupations. By offering remedies targeted to specific vulnerable groups, civil rights laws have the potential to dramatically reduce discrimination—but too often fall short due to a lack of resources for effective enforcement.
At the same time, federal laws have significant gaps that allow other types of discrimination to flourish. On a daily basis, Americans are fired and harassed because of their sexual orientation and gender identity or expression. Pregnant workers are pushed out of their jobs and refused minor accommodations that would enable them to continue working. Qualified job applicants are denied employment because of flawed personal credit history—a factor which predicts little or nothing about future job performance, but becomes a formidable barrier for women struggling to pay bills and pull themselves out of debt. Workers with caregiving responsibilities (particularly mothers) face discrimination based on stereotypes about how caregiving will impact their work performance.
All Americans deserve a fair opportunity to earn a living and sustain their families. Bills before Congress now would strengthen enforcement of equal pay laws; ensure fairness for pregnant workers; clarify that discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression is a form of unlawful sex discrimination and so is prohibited in employment and beyond; ban discrimination based on personal credit history; and ensure people with arrest or conviction records have a fair chance to work. Policymakers should also act to strengthen employment protections for workers with family care responsibilities, as a number of states have done; and increase funding for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and ensure it retains its focus on systemic discrimination.

"When it comes to financial products, the line between employee and consumer often becomes blurry. If your boss insists that you receive your wages on a pre-paid debit card that charges high fees to access your earnings or check your balance it’s clearly a serious employment problem. And yet consumer law may be workers’ best remedy. That’s what the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau implied yesterday, when it issued a bulletin clarifying that the Electronic Fund Transfer Act “prohibits employers from mandating that employees receive wages only on a payroll card of the employer’s choosing.”
Who knew the Electronic Fund Transfer Act was a worker justice statute? For low-wage employees coping with the impact of a $1.50 fee on a $7.25 hourly wage, it clearly is.
Employment credit checks offer another case in point. The credit report, a product developed to assist lenders, is now commonly used by employers in a misguided effort to assess job-seekers based on their ability to pay bills. The result is that a consumer statute – the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) – becomes one of the few protections job applicants and employees have when confronted with a significant new means of employment discrimination.
And yet the FCRA, already flawed in a consumer lending context, is truly inadequate to protect workers.  At best, it requires that employers get employees’ and job applicants’ permission to pull their credit report (withholding permission of course means you are no longer considered for the job) and that employees and job applicants be notified and get a chance to review their credit report for errors if the credit report played a role in the employer’s decision not to hire them (or in the case of existing employees, to fire them or deny a promotion).
Yet even these meager protections are widely flouted: many job seekers never find out that their credit was the reason they were denied a job.  And while it is technically illegal to use credit reports to screen employees in a way that has a disparate impact on people of color, women, people with disabilities or other groups protected by federal anti-discrimination law, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has had a very difficult time proving discrimination cases even when the impact appears evident.   
Workers can thank goodness for consumer law, and for the CFPB as a critical new enforcer (see David Callahan’s post yesterday on how the agency is helping bank customers – and may be helpful to those facing credit reporting woes as well)  but working people should not have to rely on cases where consumer statutes and workplace injustice overlap. As journalist Josh Eidelson vividly illustrates in his recent Washington Post article on how the nation’s largest employer ensures that its wages stay low, we need better labor and employment laws and more effective enforcement of the ones that exist. When your boss is mistreating you, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act shouldn’t be the only place to turn.",blog
"Today is the day the tax bill comes due.
It’s the first tax day since Congress passed, and Donald Trump signed, the $1.5 trillion tax law bestowing a gigantic permanent tax break on corporations and temporary reductions for some individuals, while stripping health coverage from millions of Americans.
My colleagues at Demos have shown how the law, passed along strict party lines, amounts to donor-driven tax policy of, by, and for the 1 percent, and a straight-forward policy of class warfare with a vast rollback of the estate tax as the cherry on top.
We have seen how massive cuts to the safety net combine with tax cuts for the wealthy to form a core part of current conservative governing philosophy.
We have seen how, as Connie Razza writes, “The decision to tax work more heavily than wealth skews our core values as a nation, rewarding the luck of having been born to wealthy parents rather than the ethic of hard work.”
What we still have not seen are Donald Trump’s personal tax returns (although these have been disclosed by every other president and major party presidential candidates for decades), which would reveal how much he and his family will personally benefit from the changes he implemented to the tax code, among other potential conflicts of interest.
We know that the changes to our tax structure passed in December, 2017 further skew a system that was already rigged in favor of wealthy individuals and corporations. Even before the tax restructuring that is redistributing our nation’s wealth up and into private and already-powerful hands, the wealthiest Americans received the most assistance from the government in building wealth, and the poorest the least. An analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found more than half of the combined value of our 10 largest federal tax expenditures (or exclusions, deductions, credits, delays, or lowered rates, which reduce taxes for certain groups of taxpayers) went to the richest 20 percent of households. The top 1 percent of households received 17 percent of the benefits.
We need a tax overhaul driven by the demos—the American people—to rewrite the rules so the rich pay their fair share in taxes and ordinary Americans get a fair shot. We need to turn our policies right side up, so we can invest in the projects that will create a society with more equity in wealth by race and ethnicity, and create more prosperity for all.
We should be expanding the estate tax, so that vast inherited wealth is not passed down intact through generations. We should roll back the corporate tax cuts and close corporate tax loopholes, particularly those loopholes that incentivize the risky practices of private equity firms and other speculators. We should repeal tax incentives for the energy sector that overwhelmingly favor the dirty fossil fuel industry, reinforcing continued pollution that contributes to health hazards and environmental disasters that impact many, especially communities of color and low-income communities.
We should restore the full deductibility of state and local taxes from federal tax returns, so that state and local governments can continue to fund their own needs and priorities without a federal penalty. And we should expand the Earned Income Tax Credit and child tax credits, lifting up struggling families.

"For hundreds of thousands of low-paid employees of federal contractors, the executive order President Obama announced in his State of the Union address will make a important difference in their incomes and lives. While the president cannot unilaterally raise the minimum wage for all working Americans (only Congress can take that action—and they should) he is exercising the executive power he has to mandate that federal contractors pay employees doing the public’s business at least $10.10 an hour as new contracts are negotiated and old ones come up for renewal.
As Demos has consistently argued, the executive order is a major victory for low-wage workers, especially the contract and concession employees organizing with Good Jobs Nation who repeatedly went on strike for higher pay. 
Now as the executive order is finalized, it will be important to see that the new minimum wage for contract workers is not just proclaimed on paper but enforced. Enforcement is a particularly serious concern because federal contractors have a terrible record of abiding by existing employment laws—and they have so far been allowed to get away with it.
A bombshell investigation by the U.S. Senate’s Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee in December found that almost 30 percent of companies receiving the largest penalties for violating federal labor law are also federal contractors. The study looks at 49 contractors responsible for large-scale labor law violations who were nonetheless paid more than $81 billion in taxpayer funds in 2012. The companies engaged in rampant wage theft and violations of the most basic health and safety laws.
“By law,” noted Committee Chair Senator Tom Harkin,  “the government is only supposed to contract with companies that it first determines to have a ‘satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics.’” Yet this law is clearly not being sufficiently enforced and monitored. Taxpayers also lose from this repeat flagrant violation of the law: a recent study by Karla Walter and David Madland at the Center for American Progress finds that companies that have the worst records of workplace violations frequently also display poor contract performance.
If contractors routinely violate current minimum wage, overtime, and worker safety laws, what gives us confidence that the new, higher minimum wage will be followed any more scrupulously?
A “responsible contractor” enforcement mechanism built into the executive order would go far towards ensuring compliance. A responsible contractor clause should require contractors to report all violations of employment laws and should give the Department of Labor authority to investigate and discover whether a contractor has significant or pervasive violations of employment laws. An order should also require contracting agencies to review and consider information about labor law violations provided by Department of Labor experts when considering a contractor’s “a satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics” in dealings with its own employees.
Without “responsible contractor” language, President Obama’s executive order will lack the key element of enforcement, and the same flagrant violations of wage and safety laws by federal contractors that Congress has already documented are likely to continue with impunity. Whether a responsible contractor clause is incorporated into the current executive order or a follow up order from the President, it is the next logical step to deter contractors from breaking existing laws as well as the new minimum wage going into effect.",blog
"In Chicago today, organizers of the Women’s March are on the move again. Racial justice activists from the Movement for Black Lives and Color of Change are marching beside them. Climate activists, immigration advocates, community organizers and progressives of many stripes are filling the streets of Chicago to demand change, not only in Washington, but in tens of thousands of McDonald’s restaurants in the U.S. and across the world.
The broad coalition is joining the Fight for $15 in their call for the fast food giant to pay a wage of $15 an hour and recognize workers’ right to form a union free of intimidation and harassment. 
“These fights are our fights,” explains Women’s March co-chair Carmen Perez, “and the only way we win is together.”
The solidarity has been building over time, as fast food workers stood up against police violence and racism in the wake of the killing of Mike Brown in 2014. Uniting this year under the slogan ""Fight Racism, Raise Pay,"" the Fight for $15 and Movement for Black Lives rallied across the country on the anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther King’s murder to highlight the interconnectedness of economic and racial justice in Dr. King’s time and our own. The imperative to join forces across a broad array of movements has become increasingly urgent as the Trump administration aims to roll back women’s rights, workers’ rights, racial justice efforts, environmental sustainability, respect for the human rights of immigrants and fundamental democratic rights.
As a result, activists are taking on not only Trump and his agenda but corporate allies that are making the country—and the world—more inequitable. Today the target is McDonald’s, poised to hold its annual shareholder meeting in the Chicago suburbs.
“McDonald’s, frankly, is the Donald Trump of corporations,” Fight for $15 organizer Kendall Fells told the Washington Post. “There’s no way to resist Donald Trump without resisting the corporations that are bringing us all down.”
Demos research finds that fast food is one of the most unequal industries in the U.S. economy, not only because fast food employees are the lowest-paid workers (with an average hourly wage of just $9.09), but also because fast food CEOs are some of the most highly compensated workers, raking in $23.8 million in total compensation on average in 2013. At McDonald’s itself, CEO Steve Easterbrook received a 368 percent raise in base pay last year.
In other words, fast food isn’t a low-wage industry—it’s just an extraordinarily inequitable one, with poverty wages for the people contending with hot grease mirrored by stratospheric pay for those at the top. The Trump administration, which initially nominated a fast food CEO to lead the Department of Labor, has outlined policies that would push the entire country further in the direction of extreme inequality. No wonder people are marching.  ",blog
"As usual, comedian Stephen Colbert hit the nail on the head. “Walmart is taking care of its employees... Not living wage care, but can of peas care.” The late-night satirist was responding to a Cleveland Plain Dealer article finding that Walmart set up a Thanksgiving food drive to benefit its own needy employees. “Critics say Walmart isn't doing enough,” Colbert continued, “but they are wrong… because Walmart isn't doing anything.” In fact, the company was not providing food, but requesting that cash-strapped employees help each other out.
Satire is one thing, but it’s worth asking what Walmart could do to improve wages for the estimated 825,000 employees that the company’s CEO recently suggested are currently paid less than $25,000 a year. In a research brief released this week, my colleague Catherine Ruetschlin and I explore one way that Walmart could provide its low-wage workforce with a substantial raise without having to raise prices to consumers at all.
We find that Walmart spent $7.6 billion last year to repurchase shares of its own stock. This followed on $36 billion in similar stock buybacks over the previous four fiscal years. The buybacks did nothing to boost Walmart’s productivity or bottom line. They didn’t enhance services or lower prices for consumers, and financial experts argue buybacks like this often don’t even end up benefitting investors over the longer term. Yet we find that if that $7.6 billion were redirected to Walmart’s low-wage workers, employees would each see a raise of $5.83 an hour – quite a substantial pay increase.
If Walmart redirected its current spending to invest in its workforce, the benefits would extend to all stake-holders in the company—customers, stockholders, taxpayers, employees and their families—and the economy as a whole.
Walmart customers would benefit from better staffed and more organized stores, rather than the long lines and empty shelves which had been discouraging shoppers. Shareholders would see a stronger company, potentially able to improve on several months of disappointing sales numbers as Walmart’s leadership on better employee pay contributed to a broader economic recovery and increased spending.  U.S. taxpayers would no longer have to subsidize a company that pays its workers less than they need to survive, as a recent study by staff from the U.S. House of Representatives found that low wages at a single Wal-Mart store cost taxpayers in between $900,000 and $1.74 million every year.
Last night, when Demos hosted a powerful event on low-wage work,  I was asked whether Walmart was likely to heed our research. In fact, the company’s public relations person has already dismissed our findings as “propaganda.” But the people Walmart should be listening to are the company’s own employees – the Walmart workers taking a stand for respect and improved wages and hours despite Walmart’s harassment, intimidation, and illegal firings, which the National Labor Relations Board has recently decided to prosecute the company for. Demos can work to shine a light on the consequences of low wages and how the company could redirect funds to raise pay, but it is employees themselves – planning to walk out on strike again this Black Friday with growing community support – to whom Walmart is ultimately accountable.",blog
"With 10.9 million Americans still out of work and 1.3 million of them now on the verge of losing all jobless aid, the barriers that keep people from finding a job loom larger than ever. One barrier in particular stands out as especially unfair and unreasonable – the common practice of reviewing a job applicant’s personal credit history when hiring.
There is little evidence that personal credit history contains relevant information about an applicant’s future job performance.
According to human resources surveys, nearly half of all employers now conduct credit checks as part of their hiring process. Yet there is little basis for this practice: while poor credit history may reveal the medical debts accrued through a child’s illness, the difficulty paying bills during a long stint of unemployment, or the financial devastation of a nasty divorce, there is little evidence that personal credit history contains relevant information about an applicant’s future job performance.  This lack of validity has not stopped the credit reporting industry from aggressively selling employers a product designed to help lenders evaluate the risks associated with making a loan.
The potential for employment credit checks to perpetuate racial discrimination is especially troubling. According to research from the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Reserve Board, and other investigators, households of color are disproportionately likely to struggle with poor credit.  Predatory lending that continues to target communities of color, as well as the enduring impact of racial discrimination may contribute to racial disparities in credit. The result is that when credit is then used a factor in determining who is hired for a job, it can become an unintentional new channel of racial discrimination.
The potential for employment credit checks to perpetuate racial discrimination is especially troubling.
But employment credit checks threaten the job prospects of an even broader number of Americans: people with substantial medical bills, difficulty paying off college loans, or debts accrued while they or someone else in their household were out of work all face a second layer of disadvantage when their financial challenges become a reason to deny them jobs. Victims of identity theft – or of the errors that plague as many as one in every five credit reports – can similarly find themselves shut out of employment opportunities as a result.
Employment credit checks also threaten the privacy of job applicants and employees. Many employers emphasize that they give job applicants the opportunity “explain” any flaws in their credit history. Yet more than half of the debts reported by collection agencies are medical bills, obliging people to expose the details of a medical condition just to get a job. Victims of domestic violence, who commonly have their credit deliberately ruined by their abuser, may be forced to make particularly painful disclosures.
The Equal Employment for All Act, introduced last week in the U.S. Senate, would prohibit employers from using personal credit history to screen job applicants or employees for most positions. The bill’s main sponsor, Senator Elizabeth Warren, describes the use of credit information in employment as just another way the system seems rigged against ordinary Americans, preventing people from getting back on their feet after a financial setback.
Neither the bad economy nor personal misfortune should become a reason to shut someone out of a job for which they are otherwise well-qualified. The Equal Employment for All Act is needed to stop to the unfair and unwarranted use of credit history in employment.",media
"I’m pleased to be here today to testify on House Bill 1744, “An Act regulating the use of credit reports by employers.”
Over the past decade, Demos has conducted extensive research on credit card debt among low- and middle-income households. In 2012, we surveyed a nationally representative sample of approximately one thousand low- and middle-income households that were carrying credit card debt for three months or longer. In addition to the questions Demos asked in the past about credit card debt I began to ask about the experience of these households with employment credit checks.[1]
My first finding is that in the survey population employment credit checks are common. Among the households in the survey population that experienced unemployment, about one in seven say that a prospective employer has asked to check their personal credit history. But it’s likely that this really understates the extent of employment credit checks: people are asked to sign a lot of things when they apply for jobs and they may not remember every piece of paper.
What types of jobs require a credit check? During a brief recent search of job postings on Craigslist in a number of Massachusetts localities, I found postings for dog walkers, building superintendents, call center workers, plumbers, and retail sales people all requiring a credit check as part of the job application.[2] Today, credit checks are required for a very wide range of positions.
In my study, I found that credit checks have a real impact—people are shut out of job opportunities because of their credit. Among those in our survey population who report that they had poor credit, one in seven report that they have been advised that they would not be hired for some position because of their credit. Again, there is evidence that this understates the true extent to the problem, but it is enough to indicate that credit checks really are a barrier to employment.
Employment credit checks have become commonplace because employers are looking for a way to predict if a potential employee will be honest, if they will handle money responsibly, if they are likely to steal or commit fraud.  For-profit credit reporting agencies take advantage of these concerns to market credit reports to employers. However, reviewing the social science research on this issue, I have found no credible evidence that credit reports reveal this information.  In fact, a spokesperson for one of the major credit reporting agencies admitted to the Oregon State Legislature in 2010, “At this point we don’t have any research to show any statistical correlation between what’s in somebody’s credit report and their job performance or their likelihood to commit fraud.”[3]
Credit reports do not reliably predict job performance or likelihood of committing a crime, but they do reveal some very personal information. For example, my research finds that poor or declining credit is associated with households experiencing job loss. It’s not surprising that families find it difficult to maintain good credit when an income-earner has been coping with extended unemployment.
I also found a number of different connections between medical debt and poor credit. I found that 55 percent – more than half – of those who report having poor credit say that “unpaid medical bills or medical debt” contributed to their poor credit. That’s a very large impact. This is consistent with a study by the Federal Reserve Board which found that 52 percent of all accounts reported by collection agencies that appeared on credit reports consisted of medical debt.[4] A lot of what employers are looking at on credit reports is medical debt, but they aren’t necessarily aware of that.
I also find that in our sample Latino and particularly African American households are more likely to report having poor credit and less likely to report having good or excellent credit than white households. This data on racial disparities is consistent with previous research, including findings by the Federal Reserve Board and the Brookings Institution.[5] A number of factors may contribute to the racial disparity in credit quality: unemployment is higher in communities of color and there’s a tremendous underlying disparity in wealth and assets compared to white households. There’s also a legacy of predatory lending that disproportionately impacts communities of color. All of this may contribute to worse credit. Employment credit checks can amplify and perpetuate this racial discrimination.
Finally, I’d like to address credit reporting errors. A comprehensive new study by the Federal Trade Commission finds that 21 percent of American consumers have some kind of error on their credit report.[6]  They found a smaller percentage of consumers have errors that would actually make it harder for them to get a loan, but the 21 percent figure is the most relevant for employment, because employer assessments of a credit report are entirely subjective. Employers are not looking at a three-digit credit score; they’re looking at list of credit accounts, how much the job applicant owes and whether they are paying as agreed or are late. There is no universally accepted way to interpret this information. As I noted earlier, there is a real lack of social science research proving that any credit information is relevant to job performance. An error that might be too small to affect the outcome in a lending scenario could stand out to an employer and make the difference and keep someone from getting hired.
In conclusion, my research finds that in the survey population employment credit checks are common and they are keeping people from getting jobs. Yet poor credit is associated with a host of factors that we don’t generally see as legitimate reasons to deny people employment: it’s associated with lack of health coverage, with medical debt, and with unemployment. We also find that people of color are disproportionately likely to report poor credit. And we see a high rate of errors in credit reports. The Demos study is another piece of evidence that employment credit checks are an illegitimate barrier to employment. House Bill 1744 would effectively remove that barrier.

"How Walmart Can Invest in Its Workforce Without Costing Customers a Dime
American workers are working harder for less, with productivity rising but living standards stagnant or declining. At the same time, stock market wealth and incomes for the highest-paid Americans have risen. Against this backdrop, the pay practices of the nation’s largest private employer have come under increased scrutiny. Walmart, with 1.3 million U.S. employees and $17 billion in annual profits, sets standards for all other retailers and across the supply chain of one of the nation’s fastest-growing industries. Walmart’s practices impact the public sector and taxpayers as well when employees earn too little to meet their needs and require public assistance. Finally, Walmart is a leader in promoting an employment model in which workers earn too little to generate the consumer demand that supports hiring and would lead to economic recovery. In the last year, Walmart employees themselves have been increasingly vocal in protesting their low pay. Since the last holiday season, Walmart employees in stores throughout the country have repeatedly spoken out in pursuit of a modest wage goal: the equivalent of $25,000 a year in wages for a full-time employee.
Now as another holiday season approaches, this research brief considers one way Walmart could meet the wage target its employees are calling for— without raising prices. We find that if Walmart redirected the $7.6 billion it spends annually on repurchases of its own company stock, these funds could be used to give Walmart’s low-paid workers a raise of $5.83 an hour, more than enough to ensure that all Walmart workers are paid a wage equivalent to at least $25,000 a year for full-time work. Curtailing share buybacks would not harm the company’s retail competitiveness or raise prices for consumers. In fact, some retail analysts have argued that by providing a substantial investment in the company’s front-line workforce, higher pay could be expected to improve employee productivity and morale while reducing Walmart’s expenses related to employee turnover. With more money in their wallets, Walmart employees would likely spend a portion of the cash at Walmart itself, boosting the company’s sales. Sales might also increase as customers benefit from an improved shopping environment.
In Demos’ prior study, Retail’s Hidden Potential: How Raising Wages Would Benefit Workers, the Industry and the Overall Economy, we found that increasing pay for low-wage workers at America’s largest retailers would also have benefits for the economy as a whole, reducing poverty, boosting economic growth, and creating over 100,000 jobs. While the impact of raising wages at a single company—even one as large and central as Walmart—would have a much smaller impact, similar benefits could be expected from a wage increase: the economy would gain from the addition of economy-supporting jobs, taxpayers would pay less to subsidize Walmart’s low- wage business model, and the company would no longer be the leading example of inequality in an economy being rapidly undermined by the shrinking middle class and lack of purchasing power. Significantly, these gains could be attained without any impact on Walmart’s low prices.

"It already seems like an age-old question: “Has Wal-Mart been good or bad?”
This week, The Washington Post's  Ezra Klein is the one asking and weighing the costs to Walmart’s workforce, its supply chain, and its competitors against the low prices the store offers consumers. He asserts:
I never came across an accounting I found sufficient. Whether Wal-Mart has been, on net, “good” or “bad” is a complicated question to frame and a devilishly tough one to answer.
It may also not be the most helpful or relevant question to ask.
 
The reality is Walmart is with us for better or worse. Imagining what a Walmart-free world would look like is an interesting exercise, but it’s not the one that brought Walmart workers and their allies to the picket line in a hundred cities on Friday. The question they were striving to answer is closer to the one the National Employment Law Project’s Annette Bernhardt asks: “what kind of Walmart do we want for our country?”
After all, the same company that was a leader in off-shoring jobs  and dragging retail wages down could lead the retail sector, and the country, down a different path.  And as my colleague Catherine Ruetschlin explained in this space last week (and discussed in more depth in her recent study), low wages are not required for low prices.
Looking at Walmart specifically, a 2011 study from the Berkeley Labor Center found that if the company raised wages for all employees to at least $12 an hour, the average Walmart consumer would pay just 46 cents more per shopping trip or $12.49 per year. Meanwhile low-income Walmart employees would see their wages lifted by as much as $6,500 a year. Looking at America's large retailers as a whole, (and using a slightly different set of assumptions) Demos finds that consumers would pay just 7 to 15 cents more per shopping trip ($8.87 to $17.73 per year) for a wage increase sufficient to raise 1.5 million retail workers and the  family members they support out of poverty or near poverty. The wage hike would also boost GDP and create jobs.
As the data indicates, the low wages vs. low prices debate is a false choice. Tomorrow's Walmart (or for that matter, tomorrow’s Amazon.com, which Klein notes is also transforming our economy and is engendering its own push for improved working conditions) could take the nation along a higher road that benefits both workers and consumers, not to mention the economy as a whole.
When we ask instead what America’s largest employer—and the fast-growing retail sector that it dominates— should look like going forward, it leads us not to a “devilishly tough” debate about past impact but to one about what can we do as workers, consumers, shareholders and democratic citizens to shape that path.  This is the question we should be asking and striving to answer.",blog
"Today more than a hundred New Yorkers from a host of organizations  will descend on Albany, calling on their elected officials to finally guarantee paid family leave to working people statewide. They’ll argue that for too many New Yorkers, bonding with a new baby or tending to a loved one who is seriously ill is impossible without missing a much-needed paycheck. And the numbers back them up.
In a new brief released today, my colleague Robert Hiltonsmith and I find that 6.4 million working New Yorkers  – 87 percent of the state’s non-farm, private sector workforce – do not receive paid family leave through their employers.
We find that in the retail industry, which employs almost a million workers statewide, 94 percent of employees lack paid family leave. The situation is similar in other low-paying industries, where workers also struggle with low wages and unstable schedules.  And even in high-flying industries like finance and insurance – where New York employer Goldman Sachs recently made headlines by improving the paid leave benefits it offers employees – most employees still don’t get paid family leave.
As we argue in the brief:
Ensuring that the next generation gets a healthy, loving start in life – and that families don’t fall into poverty as they struggle to care for one another in times of sickness – are society-wide challenges, not problems that individual families and businesses can solve on their own. Surveys find that 80 percent of Americans, including 71 percent of Republicans, favor requiring all employers to offer paid leave to parents of new children and employees caring for sick family members. Polls of New Yorkers are similarly favorable, with 81 percent of New York City residents (including 80 percent of Republicans) supporting the establishment of a paid family leave insurance system even if it means a dollar a week would be deducted from their own paychecks to fund it.
Public paid family leave insurance has been successfully implemented in California, in neighboring New Jersey, and in Rhode Island, where studies find that they have had little impact on how employers do business, even as working families see substantial benefits.
In New York, Governor Cuomo’s recent move to include paid leave in his executive budget is tremendously encouraging, especially since his plan includes 12 weeks of job-protected leave and coverage of all employers with no exceptions. It's even more exciting that the Governor has reportedly enhanced the wage replacement rate in his original proposal to 2/3 of a worker's average weekly wage. Without at least this rate, lower paid workers would still be unable to afford time with new babies and sick loved ones and New York would remain a place where only higher-income people are able to take time to care for their families.
As Governor Cuomo noted, “You shouldn't have to choose between losing your job and being in debt and being a decent human being.” With a public system that ensures adequate wage replacement for 12 weeks of job-protected leave, New York State can become a leader.",blog
"Donald Trump — who founded his campaign on an appeal to white racial anxiety and began his presidency with an immigration policy that discriminates on the basis of national origin — is unlikely to put forth serious policy proposals on reducing racial and ethnic inequality. Instead, many fear that his administration will promote policies that further expand the nation’s already vast and growing racial wealth gap.
To effectively oppose these policies, and to push for better alternatives at the state and local level, Americans need clarity on the causes of racial economic inequality and on which policies will and will not reduce it. That’s why Demos and the Institute on Assets and Social Policy at Brandeis University developed the Racial Wealth Audit and are working on a series of papers analyzing the racial wealth gap and how policy affects it.
The first step is understanding the dimensions of the wealth gap. Our new analysis of data from the Survey of Consumer Finances reveals that the median white household possessed $13 in net wealth for every dollar held by the median black household in 2013. That same year, median white households possessed $10 for each dollar held by the median Latino/a household.
The causes of the racial wealth gap are clear: centuries of unjust public policies, from slavery to segregation to redlining, allowed white households to accumulate wealth through opportunities that were systematically denied to (and frequently came at the expense of) people of color. The outcomes of past injustice are carried forward as wealth is handed down across generations and are reinforced by ostensibly “color-blind” practices and policies in effect today.
Yet many popular explanations for racial economic inequality overlook these deep roots, insisting that wealth disparities must be solely the result of individual life choices and personal achievements. If only people of color changed their behavior in some key way, this line of thought contends, racial wealth economic inequality would vanish. Our new report, ""The Asset Value of Whiteness,"" provides data indicating that it is false.
Drawing on data from the 2013 Survey of Consumer Finances, we find that white adults who don’t graduate high school, don’t get married before having children, and don’t work full time still have much greater wealth at the median than comparable black and Latino adults — and often have more wealth than black and Latino households that have married, completed more education, or work longer hours. Differences in consumption habits also cannot explain the wealth gap; we look at academic research finding that white households spend more than black households of comparable incomes, yet still have more wealth.
Doing “everything right” — making all the optimal life choices to build wealth and get ahead, despite obstacles — is still not enough for black and Latino households to accumulate as much wealth as their white counterparts.
Consider our findings on single parents. In another recent report, ""The Parent Trap,"" I examined the economic insecurity of families with young children, looking at the host of pressures that bear down the most fiercely on single parents who struggle to both care for their children and earn a living to support them. Single mothers face high rates of poverty and unemployment. Yet white single mothers nevertheless benefit from intergenerational transfers of wealth at much higher rates than households of color. As a result, as much as single mothers struggle, the median white single parent has 2.2 times more wealth than the median black two-parent household and 1.9 times more wealth than the median Latino two-parent household. Family structure, we conclude, does not drive racial inequity, and racial inequity persists regardless of family structure.
Addressing the racial wealth gap – and ultimately, building a more equitable society – will require a shift in focus away from individual behavior toward policy that confronts structural and institutional racism. Next Monday, February 13, IASP and Demos will launch RacialWealthAudit.org a new website containing information on our Racial Wealth Audit, a framework to help evaluate a potential policy’s impact on the wealth gap.",blog
"While Michigan Governor Rick Snyder was never exactly beloved by all, voters liked him a lot more before last week. That’s when Snyder signed legislation radically undercutting the state’s labor unions – a so-called “right-to-work” law – that he had previously insisted was “too divisive” to enact. Today, a new poll shows Snyder’s popularity has plummeted 28 points making him one of the least popular sitting governors in the nation. No one seems to doubt that the anti-union law is the cause of his abrupt fall from grace.
But if Governor Snyder isn’t benefitting from his surprise legislative power play, who is? Snyder and the bill’s other backers like to claim that weakening unions will help attract jobs and  grow the economy, but this doesn’t pass the laugh test. A look at states’ unemployment rates,  per capita income, and rates of job growth reveals no correlation with so-called “right to work” (RTW) laws. Furthermore, finds University of Oregon professor Gordon Lafer, there is no evidence that RTW laws affect companies’ siting decisions.  Even the law’s name is a cynical absurdity, as economist Dean Baker points out in a recent op-ed.
In fact, RTW laws reliably offer states a very negative set of outcomes. As I wrote when Indiana passed a similar law in January, “right to work” is a formula for shrinking paychecks. By making it harder for unions to collect the dues that enable them to function, RTW undermines the ability of both union and non-union workers to get a fair deal in the workplace. The average full-time, full-year worker in a RTW state earns about $1,500 less each year than a similar worker in a non-right to work state, according to a study by economists Elise Gould and Heidi Shierholz. The laws also leave workers less likely to get health insurance or pensions through their jobs.
But if Governor Snyder has alienated voters and undercut his state’s workforce, he hasn’t disappointed everyone. As many commentators have noted, undermining unions looks like a savvy piece of political gamesmanship for the Republican Party, since weakening organized labor damages a major source of Democratic Party funding and organizational support.
At the same time, the folks at the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC)– the same outfit that worked to spread Florida-style “stand your ground” gun laws to other states – are surely delighted that their model anti-union legislation was copied so faithfully by Michigan legislators.
The corporate interests behind ALEC are celebrating too: for the big business lobby, RTW is an effort to not only lower wages and get a cheaper workforce but also weaken a political foe that has been the most effective force opposing them on a range of issues, from the privatization of education to Wall Street reform, as well as more traditional workplace issues like raising the minimum wage. Corporate-backed efforts to push anti-union laws in Michigan, Indiana, Ohio and Wisconsin are no accident. What’s more, the attack comes at a time when, as Paul Krugman recently wrote, “profits have surged as a share of national income, while wages and other labor compensation are down. The pie isn’t growing the way it should — but capital is doing fine by grabbing an ever-larger slice, at labor’s expense.” Anti-union laws are one way to reinforce that trend.
The symbolism of a high-profile blow to unions in a state so central to the labor movement’s birth cannot be overstated. But there are also reasons to hope for a labor resurgence: as I’ve been documenting this year, the nation has also seen an upsurge in workplace organizing by low-wage employees. In Chicago, the teacher’s union won its high-profile strike this year with bottom-up leadership and deep public support. And when voters across the country were asked to weigh in directly on measures to raise workplace standards and preserve rights on the job, working people mostly came out the winners. In Michigan itself, Governor Snyder can only hope that the voters who disdain him today will forget his betrayal by the next election.",blog
"We’ve been talking a lot this year on PolicyShop about the work of groups like Fast Food Forward, OUR Walmart, the Retail Action Project, the Restaurant Opportunities Centers, Hotel Workers Rising, and the National Domestic Workers Alliance. These groups and their allies are organizing low-wage workers to speak out for basic respect on the job, better pay, and improved working conditions (including taken-for-granted essentials like paid sick days and schedules they can count on).  The workers they represent are risking their paychecks – and in many cases, their jobs – to stand up for themselves and their co-workers. In the process, they’re also taking a stand for the future of our economy.
In Demos' recent paper on the retail industry,  we describe how boosting retail wages would not just lift workers and their families out of poverty   but also improve the U.S. economy and create jobs.  We think retailers would be smart to act on our study. Yet it’s hard to see how a broad-based retail wage increase will really happen except as a result of worker or government pressure.
That’s a point Eduardo Porter expands on in today’s New York Times, as he considers what kind of economy we’re in for if we don’t see an upsurge in job quality at the bottom of the labor market:
. . . the McJob is hardly a niche of the labor market reserved for the uneducated few. Rather, it might be the biggest job of our future.
The American labor market has been hollowing out for decades — losing many of the middle-skilled, relatively well-paid jobs in manufacturing that can be performed more cheaply by machines or workers overseas. It has split between a high end of well-educated workers, and a low end of less-educated workers performing jobs, mostly in the service sector, that cannot be outsourced or mechanized.
This process is not expected to reverse any time soon. According to government statistics, personal care aides will make up the fastest-growing occupation this decade. The Economic Policy Institute study found that some 57 percent of them live in poverty…
Porter points out that in the past, labor unions have succeeded in improving jobs that used to be ill-paid and dangerous – turning them into the kind of middle-class positions that could sustain a family. He points to a recent study by the International Labor Organization that shows that jobs paying low wages are scarce in countries where unionization rates are high. Yet he also reminds us that unions today represent just 7 percent of the private sector workforce, and are “fighting long odds —hemmed in by legal decisions limiting how they can organize and protest, while trying to organize workers in industries of low skill and high turnover like fast food.”
One solution, Porter suggests, might look like SEIU’s successful Justice for Janitors campaign in the 1990s, which garnered broad community support and “framed the effort as a broad movement for the economic rights of low-wage workers” not only janitorial staff. It’s clear that the new efforts to organize low-wage workers – many of them outside the bounds of a legally-sanctioned union – are also adopting the broader “social movement” ethos. It is, as Porter argues, what they’ll need to win.  ",blog
"“I was the victim of wage theft, exploitation, and of a stolen paycheck. I was never paid for time I regularly worked before clocking in. Every time I spoke up about the problem I was retaliated against by having my hours cut and my shifts changed.” 
Those were the powerful words of long-time Carl’s Jr. employee Roberto Ramirez as he spoke in Spanish before a Senate forum this week. The treatment Ramirez tearfully described was illegal, exactly the type of abuse working people depend on the U.S. Department of Labor to investigate and remedy. But the man ultimately responsible for working conditions at Carl’s Jr. – the chief executive who built his personal fortune on the mistreatment of workers like Mr. Ramirez – is now Donald Trump’s choice to lead the Department of Labor, charged with enforcing these very laws.
Andrew Puzder has been CEO of fast food chain CKE Restaurants, Inc. (which includes Hardees and Carl’s Jr.) since 2000. During that time, his company was a serial violator of key worker protection laws, even as Puzder himself spoke out against minimum wage, overtime, and sick leave rules, even expressing the wish that his employees were more like robots who would never take a vacation or sue him for racially discriminating against them.
On Thursday, Carl’s Jr. and Hardees employees across the country took to the streets with the Fight for $15 to tell the nation exactly how unacceptable a Labor Secretary Puzder would be. “If Puzder is confirmed as labor secretary, it will mean the Trump years will be about low pay, wage theft, sexual harassment and racial discrimination instead of making lives better for working Americans like me,” protested Terrance Dixon, a worker at Hardees from St. Louis.
A new investigation by the Century Foundation tracks 166 investigations by the Department of Labor into Puzder’s restaurants across the country. They find that 87 investigations revealed at least one violation of the law. Violations of wage and hour laws resulted in $145,310 in back wages paid to 877 employees from 2004–2016. Civil penalties totaled $156,377, and 1,563 workers were exposed to wage and hour or workplace safety violations.
The extensive record of  legal violations should immediately disqualify Puzder from leading the agency responsible for protecting workers. Yet a survey of workers at Carl’s Jr. and Hardees suggests that the violations on record are just the tip of the iceberg. The Restaurant Opportunities Centers surveyed more than 500 employees of Puzder’s company finding that:
* Sixty-six percent of women at CKE Restaurants reported experiencing unwanted sexual behaviors at work, compared to 40% of women in the fast food industry overall, according to a national survey. Women working at CKE reported over 1.5 times the rate of sexual harassment reported for the industry overall.
		* Due to severe understaffing in the company, almost a third (28%) of respondents worked off-the-clock. Approximately one-third reported a wide range of wage theft violations, including not receiving required breaks, and overtime pay.
		* Seventy-nine percent of CKE Restaurants workers reported that they have prepared or served food while sick, this is higher than the rate in any of the cities we have previously surveyed.
If worker claims from the survey are substantiated, violations at Puzder’s fast food restaurants are far more prevalent than what has been identified and penalized so far. This suggests that much tougher enforcement of minimum wage, workplace safety, harassment, and discrimination laws is needed and the Department of Labor should devote many more resources for investigation of these crimes. While President Obama’s Labor Secretary, Tom Perez has made vigorous efforts toward better enforcement of workplace protections, further strengthening prosecution would be a fitting role for a president who campaigned as a champion of the working class. Yet Puzder’s business triumphs have come directly at the expense the same working people Trump pledged to help. Everything about his record suggests that Andrew Puzder would take the Department of Labor in exactly the wrong direction.",blog
"Thank you Chairman Wolf, Chairman Scibak, and Honorable Members of the Committee for this opportunity to present testimony. My name is Amy Traub and I am a senior policy analyst with Dēmos. Dēmos is a public policy organization working for an America where we all have an equal say in our democracy and an equal chance in our economy. I’m pleased to be here today to testify on Senate Bill 123, “An Act regulating the use of credit reports by employers.”
This legislation would prohibit employers, prospective employers, and employment agencies from using consumer credit reports for any employment purpose, except as otherwise required by state or federal law.
The bill is critical because today in Massachusetts, qualified job seekers are being turned away from employment solely because of their personal credit history. People whose credit is damaged as a result of medical debt, student loans, a layoff, divorce, predatory lending, identity theft, or simple error are shut out of jobs—despite a lack of social science evidence connecting someone’s credit history with their job performance.  Looking at job listings recently posted around the state of Massachusetts, credit checks are required for entry-level retail workers, caterers, delivery drivers, engineers, maintenance workers, financial employees, security guards, and auto mechanics, just to name a few positions.
The Society for Human Resources Management finds that about half of employers nationwide check credit as part of their hiring process for some or all positions. My own research at Demos finds that employment credit checks have a real impact – people are shut out of job opportunities because of their credit. At Demos we surveyed low- and middle-income households that were carrying credit card debt. Among those who had poor credit, one in seven report that they have been advised that they would not be hired for some position because of their credit.
I believe that this understates the true extent to the problem because many job applicants do not even realize that their credit is the reason they are rejected from job after job.
Credit checks are a serious barrier to employment and can create a vicious cycle: people with flawed credit because of medical debt or any other reason cannot get jobs because of their damaged credit, and cannot repay their debts and improve their credit because they can’t get a job.  This legislation would end the vicious cycle.
Ten other states, including Connecticut and Vermont, have recognized the danger and have passed laws restricting the use of employment credit checks. Unfortunately, as a result of industry lobbying, the ten state laws currently in effect were weakened to include numerous exemptions that undermine the efficacy of the legislation. These exemptions – which often carve out broad general categories or specific job positions for which employment credit checks can still be conducted – are not substantiated by research showing that credit checks are valid for the exempted positions. Massachusetts has an opportunity not only to follow in the footsteps of these other states but to pass a stronger and more protective law without unwarranted exemptions. New York and Maine are currently considering strong laws similar to Senate Bill 123.
I will conclude by noting that Senator Elizabeth Warren has sponsored national legislation known as the Equal Employment for All Act that mirrors Senate Bill 123, banning employment credit checks without unjustified exceptions. Yet her legislation faces an uphill battle in the United States Congress. I urge you to enact this important bill in the state of Massachusetts.
Thank you! I’d be very pleased to answer any questions and to share copies of my research.",testimony-and-public-comment
"Demos strongly urges the members of the U.S. Senate Banking Committee to vote in favor of confirming Richard Cordray to direct the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for a full term. Director Cordray is highly qualified and has done an admirable job leading the Bureau so far.
Demos is a non-partisan public policy organization working for an America where we all have an equal say in our democracy and an equal chance in our economy.
The finances of American families are too fragile for lenders and other financial companies to continue siphoning away hundreds of billions of dollars in unfair and deceptive fees and penalties every year. Americans are still struggling to cope with the near-collapse of our economy in 2008, which was brought on by the excesses of the financial sector.  Under Cordray’s leadership, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has begun to take powerful steps to help families hold on to their hard-earned money, taking complaints from financial customers, helping students and their families to navigate the costs of college and their borrowing options, and advanced new protections for homebuyers. By releasing public investigations of the credit reporting industry, the CFPB is also shedding light on a largely hidden, yet influential corner of the financial services sector that impacts the vast majority of Americans.
Our recent research on the credit card and credit reporting industries highlights the crucial role the CFPB must play in safeguarding American consumers. In a recent report, “Discredited: How Employment Credit Checks Keep Qualified Workers Out of a Job,” Demos found evidence of racial disparities in credit quality and documented the impact that factors like medical debt and credit reporting errors can have on Americans’ ability not only to qualify for a home or car loan or achieve a fair interest rate on a credit card, but even to secure a job and earn a living. The CFPB needs strong leadership to continue supervision and regulation of the credit reporting industry that touches so many areas of our lives.
American families need the CFPB to protect them from the abuses of the credit card industry. The results of Demos’ 2012 National Survey on Credit Card Debt of Low-and Middle-Income Households, highlight the importance of the agency in enforcing the Credit CARD Act, which we find successful in helping households pay down their balances faster and avoid excessive fees and interest rate hikes. Our research indicates that 90 percent of low- and middle-income households carrying credit card debt have noticed the new credit card billing information detailing how long it will take to pay off the current balance if consumers pay only the minimum payment amount each month and 33 percent report they are responding to the new information by paying their balances down faster.  The number of households in our sample who report paying late fees on their credit cards has also declined dramatically: in our 2008 survey, half of households reported accruing late fees—in 2012, it was just 28 percent. Strong CFPB enforcement is critical to maintaining and expanding on these gains.
Under current law, the Bureau is fully accountable to the American people, to Congress, the judiciary, and the President. It has sufficient freedom of action to operate successfully, but it is also already more constrained – by oversight from other regulators and by special review by small business representatives – than any other financial agency. The Bureau’s existing structure and means of funding are key aspects of its effectiveness. In order to avoid budget pressures or rider provisions, the CFPB's budget must not be funded by appropriations. It is also important that the Bureau have a single head independently appointed by the president for a specified term and not subject to supervision by another regulator, person or board because the Bureau must have a clear, uncompromised and independent focus on protecting consumers.
If the Senate obstructs Cordray’s confirmation indefinitely, uncertainty about the validity of the CFPB’s actions and rules will grow, harming both consumers and industry alike. Without clear authority and a level playing field, consumers will continue to be harmed by unregulated financial practices, and financial companies that play by the rules will be faced with a disadvantage from unregulated, unscrupulous competitors. A lack of enforcement against predatory financial practices could put the entire economy at risk.
It is time for the Senate to put politics behind and put consumers, members of the armed forces, and seniors first. We urge you to vote to confirm Richard Cordray to direct the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",testimony-and-public-comment
"Manufacturing jobs were supposed to be the good jobs.
They are, as the subtitle of a devastating new report from the National Employment Law Project points out, the jobs that “built America’s middle class”—enabling generations of workers without a college degree to raise their families with dignity and a middle-class standard of living. In recent decades, as the U.S. economy has lost manufacturing work to technological advance and off-shoring to other countries, the service sector has made up a growing share of American jobs.
Yet many service sector jobs—particularly many positions in the booming retail, hospitality, and health care industries—don’t offer family-supporting wages, regular hours, or the comprehensive health care, retirement, and other benefits that made manufacturing jobs into high quality positions. One could draw an easy conclusion: to rebuild the middle class, we just need to bring to back American manufacturing.
The problem is, manufacturing jobs aren’t what they used to be.
NELP’s report marshals data to show that although manufacturing jobs once paid a wage significantly higher than the U.S. average, the average factory worker actually made 7.7 percent below the median wage for all occupations in 2013. Today, more than 600,000 manufacturing workers make just $9.60 per hour or less. More than 1.5 million manufacturing workers—one out of every four—make $11.91 or less.  And while there has been a particular resurgence in U.S. auto manufacturing jobs since 2009, auto wages have declined even faster than manufacturing pay as a whole. The rise of temp jobs in manufacturing is a key reason for the decline in job quality, with these jobs offering fewer benefits and generally worse working conditions in addition to the lower wages.
In the New York Times, study co-author Catherine Ruckelshaus points to the substantial subsidies that the federal, state, and local governments have offered companies in an effort to lure factories and manufacturing jobs. “If you are getting a tax break or a subsidy, we should make sure those jobs are good jobs,” Ruckelshaus asserts. It’s a critical point, given the way subsidies can deplete already-strained public budgets in pursuit of “good jobs” that never quite materialize. The conclusion, stated more explicitly in some of NELP's other work, is that public subsidies and tax breaks should be tied to concrete measures of job quality, with an opportunity for the subsidy to be rescinded if the promised well-paying positions aren’t generated. Living wage laws are one proven way to do this.
Yet the declining quality of manufacturing jobs also has deeper implications.
The mystique of manufacturing jobs as “good jobs” that can sustain the nation’s middle class obscures the reality that industrial work was not especially well-compensated until the labor militancy in the first half of the twentieth century unionized factories and raised job standards. A powerful labor movement, rooted in manufacturing, built the middle class. With workers in a far weaker state today—especially in the states that have seen the greatest resurgence in manufacturing employment—it is not a surprise that the quality of industrial jobs has declined. When workers don’t have the power (whether embodied by laws, collective bargaining, or a mechanism like worker-ownership) to insist that manufacturing jobs be “good jobs,” they won’t be.
On the flip side, if manufacturing doesn’t have inherent “good job” properties and it is instead workers’ collective power that determines whether job quality in an industry is high or low, this suggests that traditionally low-paid service sector jobs can also be transformed into positions that sustain a middle-class standard of living.
We can see this in the case of unionized hotel workers in New York City. It’s the animating force behind the “Fight for 15” in all its growing incarnations in the service sector, as home health care workers, retail employees, and fast food workers organize and strike to improve the quality of their own jobs.
The downgrading of American jobs into positions with low pay, erratic and insufficient schedules, and few benefits has been described as the creation of a “Wamart Economy” because of the role the nation’s largest employer has played in promoting the low-road employment model, (despite its high profits) squeezing suppliers and vying with competitors until many adopt the same practices. With American manufacturing heading down the same road, and many jobs for college graduates caught in a disturbingly similar spiral, it becomes more difficult to look to manufacturing or education to save the middle class.
Instead, it may be the employees of Walmart itself who have the right idea: walking out on strike on strike on November 28—the biggest shopping day of the year—to call for better wages and working conditions. To support them, go to http://blackfridayprotests.org/",blog
"In an economic address last year, President Obama declared that his highest priority would be addressing economic inequality and reversing the long erosion of middle-class security. “Whatever executive authority I have to help the middle class, I'll use it,” the president announced. He wasn’t kidding.
In January, the president signed an executive order raising wages for low-paid federal contract workers, even as he urged Congress, businesses, and states to adopt broader minimum wage increases. Now the president has announced he will seek to modernize Department of Labor regulations that keep millions of workers from receiving overtime pay. It’s another step toward helping working Americans bring home more of the gains they contribute to the economy.
The problem is that millions of working Americans are putting in extra hours on the job but not being compensated for it. That’s because the Department of Labor, which is empowered by Congress to set salary thresholds and establish the job duties used to determine which workers are exempted from overtime pay rules, has not updated its regulations in a decade. Now the president is directing the Department of Labor to act, updating the rules and ensuring that millions more workers—from the night manager at Burger King pulling extra shifts to the supervisor of a supermarket meat department who ends up working 60 hours—will get more of the money they’re working for.
“Americans are working longer hours and are more productive—yet wages are largely flat.” That’s the story that the Economic Policy Institute, backed up by reams of carefully analyzed data, has been telling with increasing urgency for many years. So it’s little surprise that EPI’s Ross Eisenbrey has done the definitive analysis on the need to modernize overtime rules.
In an op-ed in The New York Times, Eisenbrey wrote:
As with the minimum wage, which is not automatically adjusted for inflation and tends to lose real value unless it is raised, the overtime exemption threshold generally languishes. That means that many people who once would have been paid 1.5 times their wage when working overtime are not, violating the spirit of the law.
 
For decades, the Department of Labor periodically updated the overtime salary threshold. But today’s threshold, at $455 a week, is far below historical levels in real terms. And at just $2 a week more than a poverty-level income for a family of four, it is indefensibly low. I propose that President Obama raise the threshold to $970, equal in today’s dollars to the 1975 level of $250.
 
In keeping with the original purpose of the overtime rules, this increase would make overtime pay more expensive, creating an incentive for employers to spread work among other workers (an important goal in today’s low-job-creation environment). It would also more fairly compensate those who do work more than 40 hours.
Eisenbrey has noted that approximately 10 million workers would “benefit from a rule that makes clear that anyone earning less than $50,000 a year is not exempt from overtime requirements and must be paid time-and-a-half for any work the do past 40 hours a week.”
By putting money into the hands of working people who will spend it, expanded overtime pay will also increase consumer demand, and that demand gives employers a reason to add more jobs. While many businesses may prefer to continue profiting from employees’ extra work, the economy as a whole will benefit when these workers are fairly compensated for their work.  ",blog
"If you’re feeling underpaid and overworked, you probably are: wages for typical U.S. workers still haven’t recovered from the Great Recession, even as working Americans continue to put in long hours. But a long-awaited update to the federal rules on overtime pay may finally bring relief.
The Department of Labor puts it very simply: Working extra hours = extra pay. Under the new rule, workers paid an annual salary will be eligible for overtime pay if they earn less than $913 a week ($47,476 per year) and work more than 40 hours in a given week. From construction workers to receptionists to the mother managing a Dollar Store more of the people working long hours will now get paid for it.
The Economic Policy Institute finds that the rule will benefit 12.5 million working people by extending overtime eligibility and making it easier for workers to prove they qualify for overtime. Women, African Americans, Latinos, workers under age 35, and workers with lower levels of education stand to benefit the most. Their families will also benefit as affected workers either take home larger paychecks or have more time to spend with loved ones. The Department of Labor estimates that 2.5 million children will see at least one parent gain overtime protections or get a raise to the new threshold.
One advantage of the new rule is that employers have a number of strategies to adapt, many of which also end up benefitting working people. For example, if employers don’t want to pay time-and-a-half to current employees, they’ll hire new employees to do the work: Goldman Sachs estimated the rule would create 120,000 new jobs at the same time that existing employees are no longer so overworked. Employers could also respond by raising the salaries of employees earning near the new threshold so that they’re no longer eligible for overtime. In this case, workers miss out on overtime but get a raise. Of course, employers could also cut employees’ base salary, leaving workers without extra time or money, yet in practice employers seldom reduce the pay of current workers.
In fact, as Demos President Heather McGhee noted in a video about the importance of the overtime rule, updating overtime is ultimately a “win” for employers as well because it will help to strengthen a national economy undermined by stagnant pay.
Trade agreements aside, President Obama has promoted a number of policies that lift up working people. I’m a strong supporter of the President’s executive orders for federal contractors, as well as the policies from the minimum wage to paid sick time that he’s tried fruitlessly to push through a Congress in thrall to the business lobby. My colleague Robert Hiltonsmith can tell you just how beneficial the Department of Labor’s new fiduciary rule will be for employees trying to save for retirement. Recent rules from the National Labor Relations Board are reducing some of the obstacles working people face when they try to band together to form a union. But the new overtime rule may be President Obama’s most significant policy benefitting working people. The rules may have real staying power as well—the New York Times points out they could be hard for even a Republican administration to roll back in this era of populism. Overtime rules go into effect on December 1—a parting holiday gift for Americans working long hours without getting paid for them.",blog
"All of us—people of all races and in communities of every description across America—work hard to sustain our families, pay the bills, and gain some financial security. When employers cut hours and hold down pay, working Americans struggle to find stability. And when the same employer pushes high-fee loans right outside the human resources office, draining bank accounts nearly as fast as a paycheck can fill them, working people never have a chance. That is what employees describe at Marriott International, a $42 billion corporation and the world’s largest hotel company.
The dynamics of unstable pay at Marriott and high-cost lending by its affiliated credit union take the income disparities between Marriott’s predominantly black and Latino workforce and its overwhelmingly white corporate leadership1 and enable them to metastasize into growing disparities in wealth. A study of these dynamics illustrates how everyday corporate practices feed growing racial inequality in America.
This brief unpacks these dynamics. First, we describe the scope of the nation’s racial wealth inequality and its origins in public policy and corporate practices. We look at how Marriott’s current scheduling practices, with fluctuating hours that lead to unpredictable paychecks that too often fall short, destabilize the lives of the people who work there. Next, we examine how high-fee “Mini Loans” at the financial institution set up for Marriott employees exploit this instability, stripping the wealth of the primarily African-American and Latino workers who clean rooms and common areas, cook and serve food, staff front desks, help guests with luggage, and do the other work that has enabled Marriott to become the multi-billion-dollar corporation it is today. We then consider a different loan product offered by the same employee credit union—an advantageous home mortgage loan that disproportionately serves higher-income, white employees, including company executives, living near Marriott’s corporate headquarters in Bethesda, Maryland.2 Together, this amounts to a transfer of wealth from working people of color, fueling the racial wealth gap. Corporate leaders could make decisions that would make a large and profitable corporation like Marriott—which claims to value diversity and inclusion3—a powerful force for racial equity as easily as they have chosen to reinforce growing inequality.
Wealth plays a critical role in enabling families to both handle current financial challenges and make investments in their future. Families that have accrued some wealth have a financial buffer to deal with unexpected costs, like an emergency hospital bill or disruptions in household income such as a layoff, without falling into debt or poverty. Over the longer term, wealth can expand the prospects of the next generation, helping to pay for college, provide a down payment for a first home, or capitalize a new business. Yet public policies and corporate practices contribute to a tremendously inequitable distribution of wealth in America: According to data from the Survey of Consumer Finances, the median white household possessed $13 in net wealth for every $1 held by the median black household in 2013.4 That same year, median white households possessed $10 for each $1 held by the median Latino/a household.
Research probing the causes of the racial wealth gap has traced its origins to current and past public policies and business practices that systematically lock black, Latino, and other families of color out of wealth-building opportunities that benefit white families.5 A prominent example is the government redlining between 1934 and 1968. Redlining limited both public and private investment in black neighborhoods, and undermined wealth-building prospects for generations of African-American families. The high-fee Mini Loans promoted by the Marriott Employees Federal Credit Union resemble another historical case of employers and lenders profiting from workers’ economic insecurity: the post-Civil War sharecropping system that kept formerly enslaved black families and some poor white farmers in the South trapped in a cycle of debt. The country store was at the center of this exploitative system. Since most sharecroppers did not have a steady cash flow, they used their future crop as collateral to finance loans from store merchants. At the end of the growing season and after they had paid the landowner, sharecroppers used the remainder of their crop to repay their debts to the store merchant. Country stores had little competition and often set interest rates as high as 50 or 60 percent. Focused on paying back the loans, sharecroppers grew volatile cash crops like cotton rather than subsistence crops that could feed their own families. Thus, sharecroppers were forced to borrow more money to purchase food at inflated prices from the country store.6 White store merchants and landlords built their own wealth on a system that left predominantly African-American sharecroppers in perpetual debt.
As wealth is handed down across generations, the outcomes of past injustice like the sharecropping system carry forward. Ostensibly “color-blind” policies in effect today—such as divestment from public goods like education that have the potential to give all Americans an equitable start in life, and tax policies that further subsidize already wealthy, predominantly white households—reinforce existing wealth disparities. Lending is one area where historic injustices profoundly shape current outcomes: Generations of past discrimination in employment, lending, education and housing have produced racial disparities in credit history. As a result, past discrimination is “baked in” to determinations of creditworthiness: Credit scores and other lending algorithms disproportionately represent African-American loan applicants as riskier borrowers, even when a lender never explicitly considers their race.7 Other ongoing corporate practices, from unfair pay and scheduling to discriminatory hiring and promotion, also reinforce racial disparities in income and wealth.
Unstable schedules are common in the hospitality industry, as they are in retail and other industries structured around low-paying, hourly employment.8 Marriott, like other hotel and restaurant operators, profits from its power to quickly adjust the work hours of the people employed in its hotels and resorts based on immediate customer demand. As employment expert Susan Lambert explains, “Employers tend to keep head counts high for low-level hourly jobs so that they have a large pool of workers who can be scheduled for short shifts at times of peak demand. Technologies like computerized scheduling systems and forecasting tools make it possible to predict and monitor sales and calibrate work schedules not just by the day but by the hour. Employees are called in or sent home as needed.” 9
Some Marriott hotels are cutting work hours even when demand is strong. At the Philadelphia Marriott Downtown, for example, the total number of hours worked by employees have declined over the past 5 years even as the hotel’s occupancy rate and revenue have increased.10
Yet Marriott workers depend on their jobs to earn a living. When managers cut work hours and workers’ paychecks fall short, household budgets come apart. Rent is still due and groceries cost the same, but there is suddenly less income to pay for them. Unstable schedules with short hours can even increase household costs when working parents scramble to find childcare to cover a last-minute change in work hours and workers must pay for transportation to and from a shift that may last only a couple of hours. Research suggests that workers of color bear the brunt of unstable scheduling across the economy: African-American and Latino workers are more likely than their white counterparts to be relegated to part-time jobs despite wanting stable full-time employment, and early-career workers of color are more likely to receive schedules with little notice.11 At the same time, racial wealth disparities mean that workers of color have fewer other resources to draw on when hours are suddenly cut and paychecks are smaller than expected.
As Marriott creates economic instability in the lives of its workers with irregular scheduling, its affiliated financial institution generates an unusual volume of revenue through high-fee financial products. The Marriott Employee’s Federal Credit Union (MEFCU), a 33,000-member institution, is open to employees and retirees (and their family members) of Marriott International, Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company, Sodexo, and other Marriott affiliates, contractors, and franchisees. MEFCU’s entire Board of Directors—with the exception of the credit union CEO—is composed of Marriott International senior management and executives.12 While the credit union is officially a non-profit designated as serving primarily low-income members,13 the uncommonly high fees it charges raise questions about whose interests are truly served. In 2017, MEFCU charged members $3,125,001 in fees—more in fees for every dollar loaned than any other credit union of its membership type.14 As the chart below illustrates, MEFCU charges $11 in fees for every $100 loaned, substantially more than peer institutions.

One particularly troubling loan product is the high-fee $500 “Mini Loan,” which workers at some Marriott hotels can apply for directly from their workplace human resources office, according to employees.15 The Mini Loan’s interest rate is fixed at 18 percent, and the credit union charges a $35 application fee for each Mini Loan.16 According to the National Consumer Law Center’s Annual Percentage Rate (APR) calculator, the effective rate for MEFCU’s Mini Loan is 46.616 percent when including the $35 application fee (treating the amount financed as $465 rather than $500).17
Workers interviewed at the Philadelphia Marriott Downtown report using Mini Loans to afford rent, food and other monthly expenses when Marriott’s fluctuating hours result in a short paycheck too small for them to make ends meet.18 The Mini Loan is repaid in 6 monthly payments automatically deducted from the worker’s credit union account, just as their paychecks may be automatically deposited. Some workers report taking out one Mini Loan after another when they are not assigned enough work hours to keep up with expenses (including their payments on the Mini Loan).
Marriott’s predominantly African-American and Latino frontline workforce may be particularly vulnerable to this type of high-cost lending because of the long history of families of color being excluded from the wealth-building opportunities that have benefitted white families. As a result, people of color remain less likely to have savings to fall back on to weather an emergency, buy a car, attend college, pay a medical bill, start a business, or make a down payment on a home. The lack of wealth and greater need for credit to meet these expenses disproportionately expose communities of color, as well as low-wealth white communities, to predatory lending. In a vicious cycle, predatory lending strips additional resources from families and communities, increasing their reliance on borrowing in the future.
Although the Mini Loan terms are not as exploitative as those offered by commercial payday lenders, Marriott workers should be able to expect better from a non-profit institution promoting loans out of their own employer’s human resources office. While Marriott could be offering stable hours that enable working people to stick to a budget and build wealth, its credit union instead suggests employees go into debt to make up for lost income by offering a high-fee loan that drains employee savings.
The Marriott Employees Federal Credit Union does offer some employees a lucrative opportunity to build wealth: Like most credit unions, MEFCU offers its members low- interest real estate loans. Traditionally, purchasing a home has been a vital way for American families to accumulate wealth as they pay down mortgages over time. In 2017, MEFCU originated 113 real estate loans amounting to a total of $24,557,255.19 Yet MEFCU’s home loans have disproportionately gone to Marriott’s higher-paid employees. Between 2011 and 2017, 99.7 percent of the dollars loaned went to applicants with incomes higher than that of the median Marriott worker, including administrative and executive employees.20 Some of these loans have gone to top executives of Marriott International. Loans disproportionately financed properties in suburban Maryland, near Marriott’s corporate headquarters.
At the same time, Marriott’s real estate lending practices also reveal troubling racial disparities: According to data released in accordance with the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, 59 percent of black applicants were denied a home loan from MEFCU between 2011 and 2017—nearly double the denial rate of white applicants.21 African-American applicants only received a total of 12 home loans from MEFCU during the 6-year period, which amounted to just 6 percent of the total home mortgage dollars loaned by the credit union.22 Moreover, even among wealthier applicants—those making more than $100,000 annually—black applicants were denied twice as often as their white counterparts.
Across America wages are nearly frozen, work is becoming ever more insecure, and the divide between the top 1 percent of very wealthy households and the vast majority of working people is growing. Researchers find that, at current rates of wealth accumulation, it would take 242 years for black families to catch up to the amount of wealth that the median white household owns today.23 Marriott International and MEFCU did not create these conditions, but they fuel them through corporate practices including unstable schedules, high-fee financial products aimed at its struggling and predominantly African- American and Latino workforce, and mortgage loans that serve its better-off employees. A large and profitable corporation like Marriott—which claims to value diversity and inclusion—could be a powerful force for racial equity. Instead, corporate leaders have chosen policies that reinforce growing inequality.",research
"Donald Trump campaigned as the defender of working Americans. In his inaugural address, Trump vowed that every decision he made would be to benefit America’s workers. Yet his proposed federal budget, Cabinet appointments, and other actions since taking office suggest little concern for workers’ wages, safety, and overall well-being. For a plan that actually puts greater economic power in the hands of working Americans, voters should look instead to the Progressive Caucus’s newly released People's Budget, which offers a powerful alternative vision for the nation.
Time and again, Trump has wrapped the rhetoric of jobs and working people around an agenda that fundamentally serves big corporations operating with little consideration for their workforce. Nowhere are his real priorities more evident than in the repeal of Obama’s Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces executive order. The order took aim at corporations that cheat their employees out of pay and maintain dangerous work sites—yet still retain lucrative contracts with the federal government and even have their contracts renewed. Drawing on data from the Department of Labor, Demos research found that violations of core worker protection laws, from wage regulations to safety rules, are rampant among federal contractors. Yet Trump chose to go back to the old system of rewarding companies that shortchange their employees with continued government contracts.
Now consider Trump’s nominees to head the Department of Labor, an agency dedicated to protecting the rights of American workers. His first choice to lead the Department was a CEO who built his personal wealth in the fast food industry—cheating his own employees out of wages and championing a business model that treats working people as cheap and disposable. When that nominee dropped out in the face of intense criticism, Trump nominated an attorney with little history of defending the rights of working people and a documented history of biased hiring practices.
Trump’s newest “Buy American, Hire American” executive order may also prove to be more flash than substance, with analysts noting that it is likely to fall prey to the same carve-outs and caveats that have undermined similar orders for decades, leaving it unclear whether the order will actually result in any more jobs.
Even Trump’s proposed budget undermines the Department of Labor, outlining severe cuts that would slash $2.6 billion in funding for workplace safety initiatives and critical job training programs that serve dislocated workers, young people, and low-income seniors. These deep cuts—amounting to more than 20 percent of the Department of Labor’s total budget—would also hamstring the agency’s capacity to protect Americans who are cheated or have their safety put in jeopardy by their employers. While the budget also includes vague proposals encouraging states to expand apprenticeship programs, any promise is far outweighed by the severity of these cuts.
In contrast to Trump’s record of stripping away worker protections, the Progressive Caucus People's Budget would strengthen the ability of working Americans to get their fair share of the economic prosperity they help create. The budget proposal includes provisions raising the minimum wage, updating overtime pay regulations, guaranteeing basic benefits like paid sick time and paid family leave, and strengthening workers’ rights to join together in unions and bargain collectively. Where Trump shrinks the Department of Labor, the People’s Budget proposes an increase in funding for worker protection, enabling faster and more effective investigations of dangerous worksites and companies that cheat their employees. Where Trump pretends that rolling back the rules that check corporate greed is the same thing as defending jobs, the People’s Budget raises wages through concrete policies that empower workers.
On these issues that confront all of us at work, the real populist plan is obvious: the People’s Budget will give the power back to the people.  ",blog
"Seven years ago today, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act became the first piece of legislation that newly-inaugurated President Obama signed into law. The law restored protections against pay discrimination that had been restricted by a recent Supreme Court decision, making it easier for working people to hold their employers accountable for discriminatory compensation. Advocates today can point to a host of legal cases where the law made a difference, and its impact is broader still: because employers know they can still be held liable for discrimination, they have a greater incentive to pay workers fairly.
Even as the law was signed, supporters acknowledged that it would not be enough to prevent discrimination on the job.
Indeed, the latest statistics indicate that the median woman in America working full-time throughout the year is still paid just 79 cents for every dollar earned by a man. Much greater gaps occur when gender and race discrimination compound each other: at the median, Latinas are paid just 54.6 percent of white male compensation and black women earn just 59.8 percent of white male pay.
How can these persistent gaps be addressed?
One logical step is to dispel the ignorance that allows discriminatory pay to persist simply because workers of different races and genders do not realize they are being paid differently for the same work. The Paycheck Fairness Act, a companion bill to the Lilly Ledbetter Act, would have allowed employees to share wage and salary information with each other without fear of employer retaliation and required employers to demonstrate that pay gaps between men and women were based on factors other than gender. That bill has been repeatedly blocked by Congress.
Frustrated by the inaction, President Obama signed an executive order in April 2014 mandating that federal contractors allow employees to discuss compensation without fear of retaliation. Another executive action required contractors to provide the government with better data on their pay practices. This week, the Administration is acting to require that all employers with more than 100 employees on payroll report pay information as well, a step that officials explained would “bolster the government’s ability to penalize companies that engage in discriminatory pay practices and to encourage businesses to police themselves better and correct such disparities.”
Being paid less for doing the same job is just one aspect of the pay gap. Since women are more likely than their male counterparts to leave the workforce or reduce their work hours to care for children, elderly parents, or other loved ones in need, they miss out on pay, job experience, and opportunities to advance in their careers, further fueling the gender gap in pay. As I’ve noted before, providing paid family leave boosts incomes and enables women to remain attached to the workforce. Over time, paid leave could cut the pay gap in a less direct—but potentially more powerful—way than policies that aim at fighting straightforward discrimination, as vital as they are.
As I’ve argued before,  paid leave actually benefits women to a greater extent the more men use it. Combined with policies to raise the minimum wage, guarantee paid sick time, and make it easier to organize unions, paid family leave offers great potential for achieving women’s equality.
On paid leave too, Obama has worked to provide leadership without relying on Congress: the Department of Labor has provided grants to states, cities, and counties to study the effects and feasibility of paid leave programs. And the U.S. military has announced this week that it is expanding its maternity and paternity leave policies for service members.
Next week, I’ll release a brief taking a close look at public and private efforts to establish paid family leave in New York State.  Cutting the pay gap would be just one benefit of a comprehensive family leave insurance policy.",blog
"The Missouri legislature keeps stomping on working people.
In May, the city of St. Louis raised its minimum wage to $10 an hour for anyone working in city limits. More than 30,000 working people, predominantly workers of color, saw their paychecks rise. In August, Kansas City followed suit, as voters overwhelmingly approved a measure to gradually increase the minimum wage to $15 by 2022. But the Missouri state legislature acted to undercut the will of local voters: this week, a new state law went into effect yanking back the wage increases. In St. Louis, the paychecks of minimum wage workers plunged 23 percent, to just $7.70 an hour.
“I was in the process of losing my home and just beginning to catch up on my rent,” McDonald’s worker and mother of 4 Wanda Rogers told the Los Angeles Times. “It’s going to be a struggle for me again… I wish somebody at the top could come and see how hard we work and whether they can support their families off $7.70 an hour.”
Ignoring a long record of successful wage hikes across the nation, Governor Eric Greitens insisted that increasing the minimum wage “doesn’t work in practice” and would particularly harm small businesses. More than 100 small business owners in St. Louis disagreed, vowing to retain the wage increase for their employees. Nevertheless, multibillion dollar corporations like McDonald’s (which already pays higher wages in dozens of states and cities across the country and abroad) swiftly moved to cut the paychecks of their frontline workers.
But worker activists in Missouri aren’t giving up. Raise Up Missouri, a coalition of faith, labor and community groups, is gathering signatures for a November 2018 ballot initiative that would gradually raise the statewide minimum wage to $12 an hour. Their prospects are encouraging: Missouri’s workplace advocates are fresh off a recent victory pushing back against another anti-worker law promoted by the state government.
In August, activists submitted 310,567 signatures—more than triple what was required—to halt a law that would have crushed workers’ freedom to form or maintain strong unions. By restricting unions’ ability to secure support from all of the workers they represent, the so-called “right to work” law would likely have pushed down wages in Missouri just as similar laws have in Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin.
Instead of going into effect, the anti-worker “right to work” law will also appear on the November 2018 ballot for voters to decide. Corporate lobbyists are expected to spend big to turn citizens against both the minimum wage measure and the effort to support unions. As Demos research has shown, secretive “dark money” and big donors have consistently distorted American democracy, contributing to policy outcomes that don’t reflect the views of the electorate. But the 310,567 signatures vividly show that working people in Missouri are organized and ready for a fight. Returning from a trip to St. Louis in support of deep canvassing work organized by local group Organization for Black Struggle, my Demos colleague Carol Lautier reports that members are clear: economic justice will only happen if they continue to mobilize their community.",blog
"Support for Growth, Job Creation, and Career Development
The below is one policy proposal from Demos' Millions to the Middle series. Other proposed policies include:
From its establishment in 1913, the Federal Reserve has had a clear dual mandate to minimize inflation and maximize employment.1 Over the last several decades, however, the Fed has overwhelmingly prioritized its commitment to combating inflation while allowing the pursuit of full employment to take a back seat. As a result, while creditors benefitted from low inflation, Americans who could have been working instead remained unemployed. We believe these anti-inflationary priorities are fundamentally incompatible with the advancement of an economy that promotes widely-shared prosperity and broad access to the middle class.
In recent decades, the Federal Reserve has operated on the theory that “full employment” is an impossible condition to achieve through management of the monetary supply.2 According to this theory, there is a “natural” rate of unemployment that invariably arises in the labor market, and once this level has been achieved, monetary policy should be devoted solely to reducing inflation. But the Federal Reserve’s experience with expansionary monetary policy in the late 1990s suggests otherwise – illustrating that a genuine full employment agenda can be pursued without devastating consequences of high inflation. 
Consider the facts. Although the recession of the early 1990s peaked in March of 1991, unemployment continued to increase until the middle of the following year, when it began to decline and reach its pre-recession level of 5.5 percent in January of 1996. Many who believe in the existence of a “natural” rate of unemployment expected the unemployment rate to level off at 5.5 percent, but contrary to their expectations, unemployment continued to decline steadily, reaching a three-decade low of 3.9 percent in September 2000.3 In other words, the economy of the late 1990s demonstrates that unemployment can diminish without setting off an ever-increasing inflationary spiral. As Jared Bernstein and Dean Baker observe, the country as a whole “benefited enormously from the fact that the Federal Reserve Board was willing to allow the unemployment rate to remain below the estimates of the [natural rate of unemployment] and to wait and see what happened.”4
The benefits of declining unemployment were enjoyed most by those experiencing the greatest exclusion from economic prosperity: From 1995-2000, real hourly earnings for low-wage male workers grew 1.5 percent annually after a twenty year period of falling by 1 percent each year; earnings for low-wage female workers – which were flat for the previous 20 years – grew by 1.8 percent annually from 1995-2000. Unemployment levels dropped at much faster rates for African Americans and particularly African American teenagers than the rest of the economy as a whole.5
Needless to say, these trends did not continue, and economic inequality has only increased over the last 10 years. While the Great Recession clearly contributed to the reversal of these gains, monetary policy also played a role. The process had already started once the Fed resumed its contractionary monetary policy at the beginning of the last decade.6 In order to boost employment over the long term and strengthen the middle class, the Federal Reserve must prioritize its mandate to pursue full employment and maintain low interest rates accordingly.
It is important to note that, as of late, the Federal Reserve has adopted a considerably more expansionary monetary policy, reducing interest rates to the lowest levels in decades and implementing “quantitative easing” policies to expand credit availability.7 These policies are a welcome shift from the blind spots that marked the Fed’s pre-recession focus on inflation, when, despite their mandate to promote economic stability, staff and leaders failed to notice the rise of an $8 trillion housing bubble or to consider the spillover effects of its collapse. With the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that the Federal Reserve must take a broader view regarding the fundamentals of economic health. Current policies aim to mitigate that earlier failure, but they are intended largely as short-term stimulus measures to address the recession rather than long-term commitments to promoting full employment.
Our call for the Federal Reserve to embrace its mandate for full employment must be understood as a long-term priority rather than a singular proposal for spurring job growth in the wake of the current economic downturn. Inflationary targets are not enough for a responsible central bank. While aggressive expansionary policy must be maintained by the Fed in order to stimulate job growth in the short-term, it is important to emphasize that our call for full employment is a new framework for strengthening the labor market and expanding the middle class through Federal Reserve policy.
Full employment will always be relative to the particular dynamics of the current labor market. The Federal Reserve should explicitly adopt metrics relating to a high employment-to-population ratio, low numbers of discouraged workers, low numbers of involuntary part-time workers, and a high ratio of job openings to applicants as the basis for monetary policy in the U.S., supplementing its historic focus on inflation rates as the primary object of its attention.

OU SE PLIS PASE ESKÒ KREDI OU.  I can’t read the words either. But for the more than 100,000 New York City residents who speak Haitian Creole, it represents the City’s commitment to inform New Yorkers – all New Yorkers – of their rights. In this case, their right to apply for and work at a job without an employer demanding a look at their personal credit history. The alert is available not just in Haitian Creole but in all ten of New York’s most spoken languages.  And it’s joined by ads on buses, in the subway, and on the covers of the commuter papers, as well as flyers, trainings, and an extensive website.
Demos is proud to have worked with allies at the New Economy Project, NYPIRG, DC 37, RWDSU, legal services groups throughout the city, and many other organizations to enact the nation’s strongest law banning employment credit checks, a practice which we have found to be a serious barrier to economic security for job applicants, with a potentially discriminatory impact on people of color, who have been disproportionately targeted by predatory lending that can destroy credit.
Now, as New Yorkers, we’re also proud of the city’s commitment to raise public awareness of not just the Stop Credit Discrimination in Employment Act but other critical rights as well. Last month, the Fair Chance Act went into effect, making it illegal for most employers in New York City to ask about the criminal record of job applicants before making a job offer. As the City’s Commission on Human Rights explains “this means ads, applications, and interview questions cannot include inquiries into an applicant's criminal record.  This allows the applicant to be judged on his or her qualifications.”
The Commission on Human Rights is tasked with enforcing both laws, as well as the rest of New York’s far-reaching human rights law that prohibits discrimination based on race, religion, color, age, national origin, citizenship status, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, pregnancy, marital status and more. Under the direction of Commissioner Carmelyn Malalis, who has been in office a year, the Commission is broadening investigations to address systemic discrimination, is offering more training to small businesses and housing providers, and has engaged in high-profile public awareness campaigns around the Fair Chance Act and the Stop Credit Discrimination in Employment Act.
Public awareness is critical because if job seekers and employees don’t realize they have the right to seek work without being interrogated about their personal credit history, criminal record, pregnancy status, or other factors not relevant to the job, they may be impacted by discrimination without ever realizing it. As Sean McElwee and I find in a forthcoming paper, many states that enacted laws restricting employment credit checks failed to take the aggressive steps New York has committed to informing job applicants and workers of their rights. Perhaps, as a result, few people have come forward with complaints under the laws. Without awareness of rights, laws on the books might as well be a dead letter. Educating employers about their rights and responsibilities is essential for the same reason. One need only look at the uproar caused by a proposed rule to inform workers of their 70+ year-old right to join a union to see just how powerful a little awareness can be.  
“Criminal Record? You can work with that” announces the accessible ad campaign the firm Bureau Blank designed to promote awareness of the Fair Chance Act. But without the commitment to public outreach, New Yorkers would never know it. To make all our rights a reality, people across the country deserve the same commitment to public awareness.",blog
"The students assembled outside Borough of Manhattan Community College yesterday morning were indignant. “Students are juggling college expenses and family obligations,” declared student government representative Shadae Blair, “one reason we seek an education is to get ahead in life.” But students feared their efforts to get ahead would be stymied if future employers scrutinized their credit reports and didn’t like the amount of student loan debt or the size of the credit card liability they saw there.
Their concern was reasonable: Six in ten employers nationwide look at credit reports when hiring, and there are no rules or legal guidelines for what aspects of a job applicant’s credit history they can consider or what weight they should give to it. With $1 trillion of student loan debt outstanding, no one wanted to be the next Latoya Horton -- fired from a new job (or never hired at all) because of the very loans they needed to qualify for it.
 “Employment credit checks are a roadblock on the path to opportunity,” Councilman Brad Lander explained. It was why he introduced The Stop Credit Discrimination in Employment Act (Intro 857) to the City Council. The legislation, which would ban the use of credit checks in employment in New York City, is co-sponsored by a veto-proof majority of 35 City Councilmembers, including Dan Garodnick, Robert Jackson, Ydanis Rodriguez, and Margaret Chin, who attended the rally this morning. Dozens of advocacy groups -- from local folks at NYPIRG, NEDAP, the South  Brooklyn Legal  Services and District Council 37 AFSCME to national groups like  Demos  and the National Employment Law Project -- have signed on in support.
I’ve written in this space before about the compelling arguments against the use of credit checks in employment. How credit reports -- originally developed to predict loan repayment -- have never been proven reliable for employment; how they have a discriminatory impact, disproportionately harming people of color; and how they violate privacy and are too often filled with misleading errors. But it’s something else to hear those arguments ring out in a crowd of policymakers, advocates, and young people worried about their futures, insisting, as they did with a raucous chant this morning:
“Character can’t be measured by debt! Down with employer credit checks!” 
That’s the spirit that will make New York City the next jurisdiction to outlaw employment credit checks, removing a barrier to employment for anyone who’s had to borrow to make ends meet or get ahead.  ",blog
"For many Americans, the words “bad credit” are like the sound of a closing door. That’s because there’s a deeply harmful, but seldom-spoken, truth about credit reporting: It ruins lives, and crushes hopes.
When private companies gather data on our borrowing history and sell it to others to determine future lending decisions, they can reinforce economic disadvantages — and deepen America’s racial wealth divide.
To flourish in today’s economy, families need fair and affordable access to credit. Without good credit, it can be nearly impossible to purchase a car, start a business, buy a home or even rent an apartment.
Private credit reporting is failing for all of us who must rely on credit reports produced by for-profit companies to navigate financial transactions. For communities of color, credit scores evoke the decades of bank redlining and unequal access to credit whose impact persists to this day.
Our personal credit history influences whether we find work, and how much we’re charged for auto insurance.  A terrible new proposal from the Trump administration even suggests using credit reports to determine whether immigrants should be eligible for permanent residency.
But for the three giants of the consumer-credit industry - Equifax, Experian and Transunion - the private credit reporting system works quite well. These three companies rake in $10 billion annually by collecting and selling the personal data of 220 million Americans. They compile everything from our social security numbers and past addresses to the amount of credit card debt we carry and the difficulties we’ve had paying off student loans.
Companies’ minimal investment in data security has caused massive data breaches, exposing millions of consumers to identity theft. Their lax procedures lead to frequent errors, and their underfunded dispute resolution system frequently fails to help consumers resolve the problems they’ve caused.
We can’t even look at our own credit scores without paying a fee.
It’s time to move the credit reporting system away from these unaccountable companies entirely, and toward a publicly-run credit registry that would operate in the interest of consumers. Many countries in Asia and Europe already have public credit registries. At the public policy organization Demos, I helped create a new proposal explaining how a public credit registry could work in the U.S.
A public credit registry, housed in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, would offer a number of advantages. Without the need to turn a profit, the public credit registry would prioritize transparency, accuracy, security, and accountability. For example, credit reports and scores would be free to consumers at any time, and the formulas used to determine credit scores would be publicly available, with straightforward explanations of what consumers can do to improve their creditworthiness.
And while no electronic data can ever be entirely secure, the public credit registry’s mission of public accountability would provide a greater incentive to enhance data security than the current breach-prone private companies.
Building on the Internal Revenue Service’s success in maintaining secure financial information about Americans, the public credit registry would further enhance security by freezing all credit information by default, so that lenders would need authorization from consumers to access credit information.
Of course, today’s credit reporting companies did not create our nation’s racial wealth disparities: historians have documented how generations of discriminatory public policies and bank practices systematically excluded Black, Latinx, and other families of color from economic opportunities that enabled many white families to build wealth.
Since wealth is passed down through families, historic discrimination combines with current bias to shape the resources available to households today, including whether and how much families must borrow to get by day-to-day or to make major purchases like a car, home or college education.
This is where credit reporting comes in: by tracking payment and borrowing behavior shaped by these racial disparities, past discrimination is reflected in credit scores even if companies never explicitly take race into account.
As a result, today’s credit scores disproportionately represent Black and Latinx loan applicants as “riskier” customers who should accordingly be charged higher interest rates for any credit they receive. Paying higher interest on loans then becomes an additional barrier to prosperity for families of color, setting them back further.
A public credit registry could improve this situation by developing new formulas to predict creditworthiness that minimize the impact of past discrimination. And the registry could contract with licensed non-profits to offer free or low-cost credit counseling and credit rehabilitation services.
While changing credit reporting alone will never be enough to address racial economic inequality, the system could operate in a way that reduces—rather than amplifies—racial disparities. For example, credit reports could exclude late payments on predatory loans that lenders disproportionately target at communities of color, since payment on these loans reveals little about how the same borrower would handle credit that’s offered on fair terms. Past-due medical debt, which is more likely to burden Black Americans, could also be left off credit reports, as it does not predict a borrowers’ future creditworthiness.
A public credit registry could also offer consumers the choice to opt-in to having their bank account data, rental payments, or utility data included in their credit reports and scores. To empower consumers and enhance equity, consumers must affirmatively choose these data sources rather than having them included by default.
Plagued as it is by secrecy, inaccuracy, insecurity, a deep lack of public accountability, and a business model that replicates racial bias, the private credit reporting industry has failed all Americans. A public credit registry would allow consumers to take greater control over their own data and ensure that the system finally operates in the public interest.

"The more new data that comes out, the clearer the trend is: America’s middle class is in crisis. Median wages have been flat for decade or more, even as productivity and corporate profits have soared. The quality of available jobs is declining, with a shift toward part-time and contingent work. And while the Great Recession intensified these trends and added a staggering loss of housing wealth, the problems go further back and are far more systemic.
As the trend toward inequality and polarization becomes increasingly unmistakable, the critical question becomes how we understand the way this state of affairs came to be, and thus what we can do about it.
Today in Salon, writer Edward McClelland has a powerful piece on the political decisions that led to the decline of the American middle class.  The mood is elegiac:
“I know I’m dating myself by writing this,” McClelland begins, “but I remember the middle class. I grew up in an automaking town in the 1970s, when it was still possible for a high school graduate — or even a high school dropout — to get a job on an assembly line and earn more money than a high school teacher.”
Those days are over (and the fact that the “make more money than a high school teacher” angle had a great deal to do with relatively low pay in traditionally female-dominated occupations is one piece of evidence that reviving the middle class in its precise 1970s form would be undesirable as well as impossible). In any case, what’s most interesting about McClelland’s piece is not his nostalgia but the acknowledgement of political choices that led us to the current state of middle-class decline:
The shrinking of the middle class is not a failure of capitalism. It’s a failure of government. Capitalism has been doing exactly what it was designed to do: concentrating wealth in the ownership class... That’s the natural drift of the relationship between capital and labor, and it can only be arrested by an activist government that chooses to step in as a referee.
The emphasis on government choices is important. And yet McClelland’s examples of this trend don’t simply illustrate a kind of libertarian state in which government failed to step in and lift up working people. Instead most of the examples cited – from Carter’s deregulation of key industries, to Reagan’s firing of striking air traffic controllers, to Clinton’s decision to push through a massive trade deal that protected corporate interests while destabilizing the livelihoods of both U.S. and Mexican workers – show a great deal of government intervention and activism in decisive favor of large corporations and “the ownership class” in general. In some cases, these interventions may have been undertaken with the best of intentions, to lower prices or promote growth, but they ultimately tipped the balance away from the middle class and people trying to work their way into it.
It is indeed a failure of government to protect the interests of ordinary Americans to achieve and hold onto a middle-class standard of living, but the problem is not passivity and a lack of intervention. Instead, as Representative Dan Kildee of Flint, Michigan notes at the end of the article: “It is a myth that there is any market that is not supported or affected by the structure of government in one way or another… We’re picking winners and losers right now, and we’re picking the wrong ones.” (emphasis mine)
This is important to recognize because the solutions necessary to revive and rebuild the middle class are not just choices to intervene after decades of standing by – they are also choices to stop intervening in ways that actively promote corporate interests over those of working people: to stop bailing out too big to fail banks, to stop promoting secretive trade agreements that undermine workers, to stop restricting workers’ freedom to contract in ways that undercut the ability to build power in the workplace.
Don’t get me wrong, there’s a lot of positive intervention needed too (if you’re looking for big policy ideas to build a strong and diverse middle class, Demos has got them here). But the fundamental choice isn’t one between government action or inaction: it’s the type of action we want our government to take, and who benefits.
P.S: The point that the present crisis of the middle class is largely a result of government’s consistent intervention to ensure that income flows upwards is made more effectively and at greater length by Dean Baker in his book The End of Loser Liberalism, available for free download.
P.P.S. I can’t resist mentioning my gripe with the title of McClelland’s piece “RIP, the middle class: 1946-2013.” The fatalism of declaring the middle class dead does no favors for those trying to rebuild it along improved 21st century lines.",blog
"Personal debt can stand as an insurmountable obstacle to Americans wishing to build assets and secure a place in the middle class. In addition to the critical last resort of bankruptcy relief, Americans need fair rules to ensure that lenders – from credit card companies to mortgage lenders to vendors of payday loans – don’t impose excessive interest rates, fees, and penalties that make it easier for American to get into serious debt and harder for them to get out.
Although usury laws are on the books in some states across the country, they are rendered useless by deregulation of the credit industry. Deregulation of the industry began in 1978 with Marquette National Bank of Minneapolis vs. First Omaha Service Corp. and continued with Smiley vs. Citibank in 1996. Taken together, the two Supreme Court rulings allowed national banks to charge credit card customers the highest interest rate permitted in the bank’s home state, with fees defined as interest for the purposes of regulation. As a result, national banks physically moved their credit card operations to states, such as South Dakota and Delaware, that have no usury limits.
The consequences of deregulation have been pervasive usury among credit card companies, with devastating effects on the ability of Americans to accumulate and protect financial assets. And usurious interest rates are not unique to the credit card industry. The entire credit industry is engaging in usurious practices. The payday loan industry charges some of the highest interest rates of any type of creditor, and rates as high as 400 percent annual percentage rate are not uncommon. Through refund anticipation loans (RAL), the tax preparation industry is also engaging in usurious lending behavior.
Recent legislation has helped to rein in some of the worst abuses of the lending industry. The Credit CARD Act of 2009 successfully increased the transparency of rates and fees without pushing rates up.1 The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), an agency with tremendous potential for ensuring a fair marketplace for financial products.

"Staging imaginary competitions between cities and their elected leaders certainly makes for catchy headlines: “Step Aside, New York City. Los Angeles's Populism Is for Real” asserts the title of Nancy L. Cohen’s recent piece in the New Republic. “Later this month,” Cohen explains, “two [Los Angeles] City Council members will introduce a motion to raise the minimum wage to a nation-leading $15.37 an hour for hotel workers—nearly double the California minimum wage of $8.” Very welcome – but that’s just hotel workers. In Seattle, meanwhile, Mayor Ed Murray is vowing to start paying all municipal employees at least $15 an hour, and told Salon’s Josh Eidelson that “I think that we are gonna get to $15” for all of Seattle’s private sector workers as well.
The headline of that Salon article? “Move over, de Blasio: Meet the big-city mayor vowing to get his city a $15 minimum wage.” It appears that New York City, with its much-heralded progressive mayor (and the less-recognized but critically important new city council speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito, a deeply committed fighter for social and economic justice) has a lot to live up to. And it’s not just cities making wide-eyed promises and setting ambitious goals:  Seatac, WA raised its minimum wage to $15 an hour last year, while in Washington DC, the City Council voted unanimously to boost the minimum to $11.50 an hour and also expanded the city’s paid sick leave law to restaurant workers, who were previously excluded. Jersey City instituted paid sick days.
But New York will not be left in the dust. While Mayor de Blasio’s highest profile salvo against inequality is a plan to raise taxes on wealthy households in order to fund universal pre-school as well as free after-school programs for middle school students, that proposal faces barriers in the form of tax-averse Governor Andrew Cuomo and the Republican-dominated State Senate. Luckily, de Blasio’s agenda is loaded with plans he can implement without Albany’s approval. Mayor de Blasio has already signaled his eagerness to expand New York’s paid sick days law to 300,000 more working people and expand the city’s living wage law to cover employees that work at businesses renting space in city-subsidized developments.
In a city of many renters, de Blasio’s plans to enact mandatory inclusionary zoning to promote more affordable housing will provide a major boost to low-income New Yorkers as well. The mayor has also vowed to “stop credit discrimination in employment,” ensuring that New Yorkers who struggle to pay their bills are not shut out of the job market as a result. New York City’s bill preventing credit discrimination,  sponsored by Councilman Brad Lander, mirrors the latest legislative push by Senator Elizabeth Warren and is stronger than the laws in place in several states.  
But renewed big city progressivism is not just the flavor of the month. As Cohen notes in the New Republic, “L.A.’s populist moment has been long in the making…  the culmination of two decades of progressive labor and immigrant-led organizing” by groups like the Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy (LAANE).  What Cohen misses is that this is the case in New York as well, where organizations like Make the Road New York and the Working Families Party (whose decades-long rise was recently chronicled by Harold Meyerson in the American Prospect) built a deep progressive infrastructure that is increasingly producing results. In cities across the country, labor unions and organizations descended from ACORN have laid the groundwork for today’s big city focus on fighting inequality to succeed.
At the same time, the progressive turn was far from inevitable. Let’s not forget that just a few months ago, the headlines were dominated by a very different kind of competition between cities: Philadelphia closed 23 schools, displaced 10,000 students, and laid off 3,700 teachers and other school personnel, according to a tally in Labor Notes.  Not to be outdone, Chicago closed 47 schools, displaced 12,700 students who were forced to walk through dangerous neighborhoods, and laid off 2,000 education workers. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s emphasis on high-stakes testing and school closures is one of the major policies Mayor de Blasio vows to change.
Whatever happens in New York, Los Angeles and Seattle, it looks unlikely that Chicago’s mayor Rahm Emmanuel and Philadelphia’s Michael Nutter will regard themselves any time soon as part of a competition to lift low-wage workers and fight inequality. (Although if Chicago activists succeed in putting a $15 an hour minimum wage hike  before city voters, the mayor’s position may be moot).
Still, a headline in the Journal Sentinel caught my attention. Inspired by Bill de Blasio’s plans to fight inequality, Milwaukee school board member Larry Miller had a simple message: “Milwaukee needs a bolder vision.” Competition or no, that's exactly the way America's cities should be inspiring each other.",blog
"In the study Robert Hiltonsmith and I recently completed, we find that taxpayers underwrite nearly 2 million poorly-paid jobs through federal contracts and other funding streams that channel our public dollars to private companies that perform work on behalf of America, but treat their employees in a very un-American way, failing to pay enough to support a family.  
Two million sounds like a big number, especially when you consider that not only the two million workers directly employed but also the families and communities they are part of are profoundly impacted by the low wages, irregular work schedules, and lack of benefits these jobs provide.
The problem is: our number is too low.
We looked at U.S. workers employed by government contractors, paid by federal health care spending, supported by Small Business Administration loans, working on federal construction grants, and maintaining buildings leased by the federal government. But we didn’t analyze the many other ways that taxpayers subsidize the workforce costs of every private employer who fails to pay a livable wage by offering Medicaid coverage, subsidized housing assistance, the food-stamp program, child-care subsidies, energy assistance, and reduced-price school meals to workers who could not keep coming to work every day without them. The reality is, as local, state, and federal taxpayers we subsidize the bottom line (and buoy the stock price) or every private sector company that doesn’t pay its employees enough to live on.
The biggest beneficiary of taxpayer largesse is our nation’s largest employer, the low-wage behemoth Walmart. This week a new study by the Democratic staff of the U.S. House Committee on Education and the Workforce draws on data from Wisconsin’s Medicaid program to find that a single 300-employee Walmart Supercenter in Wisconsin may cost taxpayers anywhere from $904,542 to nearly $1.75 million per year, or about $5,815 per employee. Wisconsin has 100 Walmart stores, 75 that are Walmart Supercenters.  Nationwide, Walmart has more than 4,000 stores.
As I’ve written before, Walmart has been a pioneer in low-wage, low-benefit employment, driving down wages in the retail industry  and beyond and blazing a dubious path for other companies to follow.
Yet there are signs that the Walmart’s low-road, heavily subsidized model may be reaching its limits. With disappointing sales and a slipping stock price, the company that once paid its workers so little that they could only afford to shop at Walmart now discovers that in the economy it has remade in its image, many consumers can’t even afford to shop much at Walmart. According to Bloomberg News,  Walmart was counting on late tax refunds – largely the result of the Earned Income Tax Credit, another public subsidy that benefits low-wage employers – to boost sales, but even that subsidy is now insufficient.
In the midst of this mess, Walmart shows every sign of doubling down on a failed model. A recent report by Erin Johansson at American Rights at Work documents allegations of illegal tactics by Walmart to suppress employee efforts to organize and speak out about working conditions. Yet workers aren’t giving up. This week, Walmart employees from more than a dozen cities are embarking on a “Ride for Respect” that will culminate at the company’s annual shareholder meeting in Bentonville, AK. They are standing up for themselves first and foremost. But poorly paid jobs have ripple effects throughout our economy, from slowing economic recovery by depressing consumer spending to obliging taxpayers to bear the cost of supporting workers. In that sense, they are standing up for all of us.",blog
"Demos is a non-partisan public policy organization working for an America where we all have an equal say in our democracy and an equal chance in our economy. We were proud to be among the advocates who called for an executive order establishing paid sick leave for federal contractors. We write today in strong support of Executive Order 13706 and the U.S. Department of Labor’s proposed rule implementing it.
Demos research has quantified how the federal contracting system fuels inequality by funding low-wage jobs that lack critical benefits such as leave.[i] Enabling workers employed through federal contracts to accrue paid sick leave, combined with prior executive actions to raise wages for contract employees, is an important step toward reversing this process, rebuilding the country’s middle class and reaffirming the nation’s long-standing commitment to protecting workers working on behalf of America. At the same time, the Executive Order and proposed rule will contribute to improved quality, economy, and efficiency in government procurement at little cost to contractors.  
The proposed rule will directly benefit an estimated 828,000 employees of federal contractors, including an estimated 437,000 employees who currently receive no paid sick days. The proposed rule requires contractors to allow employees working on or in connection with a covered contract to accrue up to 56 hours of paid sick time annually to care for their own medical needs, a family member’s medical needs, or for purposes related to domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking. These employees will join the approximately 10 million or more workers across the country who have or will soon have access to paid sick days as a result of laws that have been enacted in five states, the District of Columbia and more than 20 localities across the country.[ii]
I. Paid sick days will improve the economy and efficiency of federal contracting.
Evidence from the private sector and the states and cities with paid sick days laws demonstrates that paid sick days improve employee retention, reduce workplace contagion and injury and increase productivity. The cost savings associated with paid sick days serve the purpose of the Order to promote economy and efficiency in federal contracting.
Paid sick days help reduce the high costs of employee turnover. Research shows that an employee is at least 25 percent less likely to voluntarily leave a job when the employee has access to paid sick days.[iii] Across all occupations, median turnover costs are estimated to be 21 percent of workers’ annual wages. For workers in high-wage jobs and senior or executive positions, turnover costs can amount to 213 percent of workers’ salaries,[iv] and even in middle- and lower-wage jobs, turnover costs are estimated to be 16 to 20 percent of workers’ annual wages.[v] Direct costs associated with turnover include separation costs, costs associated with temporary staffing, costs associated with searching for and interviewing new workers, and training costs for new workers.[vi] Indirect costs associated with turnover can arise from lost productivity leading up to and after employee separations, diminished output as new workers ramp up, reduced morale and lost institutional knowledge.[vii]
Paid sick days help reduce the risk of workplace contagion and injury. Many workers without paid sick days report to work sick rather than sacrificing critical income, resulting in co-workers’ and customers’ exposure to contagious infections. In a national survey, 87 percent of employers reported that employees had come to work with short-term, easily spread illnesses such as a cold or the flu.[viii] Paid sick days reduce the risk that employees will spread illness at work. Overall, people without paid sick time are 1.5 times more likely than people with paid sick time to go to work with a contagious illness like the flu.[ix] In a recent paper examining Google flu data from 2003 to 2015, researchers found that when workers gained access to paid sick days, the number of workers going to work with contagious illnesses decreased, causing infection rates to decrease by up to 20 percent.[x]
Paid sick days may also reduce the risk of workplace injuries. A study by researchers from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that workers with access to paid sick time were 28 percent less likely than workers without access to paid sick time to be injured on the job.[xi] Paid sick days will therefore improve the economy and efficiency of federal contracting by decreasing the amount of worker time lost to contagious illness and workplace injuries.
Paid sick days can lead to improvements in productivity. Paid sick days can reduce the risk of “presenteeism” – workers coming to work with illnesses and health conditions that reduce their productivity – a problem that costs the national economy $160 billion annually ($206.6 billion after adjusting for inflation).[xii] In one survey of human resources executives, 38 percent reported presenteeism being a problem in their organizations, and 69 percent reported having paid sick time or other paid time off policies in place as measures to prevent this problem.[xiii] Another survey showed that 26 percent of workers without paid time off to see a doctor reported having six or more days in which they were unable to concentrate at work, compared to 17 percent of workers who had such paid time off.[xiv] Paid sick days help workers recover and return to work more quickly: nationally, workers without paid sick days spent more days bedridden due to illness than workers with paid sick days.[xv]
Compliance with the EO will not unduly burden contractors. Experience shows that most employers do not face challenges when paid sick days requirements go into effect. In particular, under the proposed rule, contractors with an existing policy that provides paid time off and meets certain conditions will satisfy the requirements of the EO. This means that contractors that already provide this time will not have to provide additional time.
Even for contractors who do not already provide paid time off, evidence from the cities and states with paid sick days laws demonstrates that compliance burdens for contractors are minimal and are far outweighed by the benefits of the law. In San Francisco, home to the country’s first paid sick days standard, the Vice President of the local Chamber of Commerce – which led the fight against the law with dire predictions about its impact on employers and job growth – told the New York Times that the law’s impact was “minimal” and that “[b]y and large, [paid sick days] has not been an employer issue.”[xvi] In Connecticut, which passed a paid sick days law in 2011, a 2013 survey of employers found that the law had a minimal impact on costs. Employers identified several positive effects of paid sick days, including improved employee productivity and morale, and more than three-quarters expressed support for the law.[xvii] Nearly three years after Seattle’s 2011 adoption of its paid sick days law, nearly 70 percent of employers said they experienced no administrative difficulties with implementation and 70 percent of employers said they support the law.[xviii] Finally, in Jersey City, where paid sick days passed in 2013, businesses that changed their policies to comply with the law reported significant benefits, including a reduction in the number of sick employees coming to work, an increase in productivity, an improvement in the quality of job applicants and a reduction in employee turnover.[xix]
II.  The proposed rule will benefit workers, public health and the economy and aligns with existing state and local paid sick days laws.
The proposed rule contains important provisions on accrual and purposes of leave, covered family members, reinstatement of leave, and notice, retaliation and enforcement that will further the goal of improving economy and efficiency in federal contracting.
The proposed rule’s accrual rate and maximum accrual amount will enable workers and contractors to realize the benefits of paid sick days and are in line with state and local laws. The proposed rule requires contractors to allow workers to accrue one hour of paid sick time for every 30 hours worked on or in connection with a covered contract, and permits the contractor to limit an employee’s accrual to 56 hours (the equivalent of seven days for a full-time worker) annually. We are pleased that “hours worked” encompasses all time for which an employee is or should be paid, including when the employee is using paid sick days or other paid time off provided by the contractor.
Enabling workers to accrue an adequate amount of time is essential to realizing the health benefits of paid sick days. An uncomplicated case of influenza can take between three and seven days to resolve, and most healthy adults may be contagious for five to seven days after becoming sick.[xx] In addition, allowing accrual up to 56 hours is in line with typical private sector employers’ practices: the majority of private sector workers with paid sick days receive five to nine days per year.[xxi] Offering comparable benefits may help federal contractors compete for talented employees. The proposed accrual rate is also consistent with existing paid sick days laws; the vast majority – more than two thirds – allow workers to accrue sick time at this exact rate.
The purposes for which paid sick time can be taken under the proposed rule will lead to a more productive workforce and will improve the health and safety of workers. The proposed rule requires that workers must be allowed to use their paid sick time for absences from work due to the employee’s or a family member’s physical or mental illness or need for medical care, or for purposes related to the employee or employee’s family member being a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking. These purposes are consistent with paid sick days laws across the country.
Providing workers time off to attend to their own and their family members’ health care needs will ensure a healthier and more productive federal contracting workforce. Paid sick time reduces recovery time, promotes the use of regular medical providers rather than hospital emergency departments, and reduces the likelihood of people spreading illness.[xxii] Access to paid sick time can also help decrease the likelihood that a worker will put off needed care, and can increase the rates of preventive care among workers and their children.[xxiii] Allowing workers time off to care for their children makes recovery faster and can prevent future health problems.[xxiv]
The proposed rule’s inclusion of time off related to domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking is also critical to the safety and economic security of workers. Survivors of domestic and sexual violence are often forced to lose days of paid employment because of the violence they face. According to surveys from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 36 percent of rape and sexual assault victims lost more than 10 days of work following victimization, and more than half of stalking victims lost five or more days of work.[xxv] Each year, victims of domestic violence are forced to miss nearly eight million days of paid work, costing more than $700 million annually due to lost productivity.[xxvi]
We fully support DOL’s proposed definition of “[i]ndividual related by blood or affinity whose close association with the employee is the equivalent of a family relationship” to mean “any person with whom the employee has a significant personal bond that is or is like a family relationship, regardless of biological or legal relationship.” In response to DOL’s request for input, we do not believe specific limitations are necessary. In fact, any attempt to enumerate and limit the types of relationships covered by the “blood or affinity” standard could undermine its purpose and exclude important family relationships. DOL’s emphasis on a significant personal bond, regardless of a biological or legal relationship, captures the essence of this standard and reflects the reality of today’s families. In particular, DOL’s example of a worker who has provided, for five years, unpaid care to an elderly neighbor captures the important relationships covered by a flexible definition.
We strongly support reinstatement of accrued unused paid sick time for employees rehired by the same contractor or a successor contractor within 12 months after a job separation. Reinstatement of paid sick time means that an employee will not lose her accrued time if she leaves and returns to the same job on one contract or while she remains employed by an employer in between work on covered contracts. Additionally, we fully support DOL’s interpretation of the EO to mean that an employee does not forfeit her accrued paid sick time when she takes a job working on a successor contract. Reinstating unused paid sick time may encourage employees to continue working for the same contractor on new contracts and on successor contracts, which will improve efficiency for the contractor and for the government by improving continuity and reducing training costs.  
The proposed rule contains important provisions on notice, interference and discrimination, and enforcement. The proposed rule requires contractors to notify employees performing work on or in connection with a covered contract of the paid sick time requirements by posting a notice to be provided by DOL in a prominent and accessible location. Contractors are familiar with posting requirements under federal employment laws and executive orders.[xxvii] Additionally, the proposed rule requires contractors to inform employees in writing of the amount of paid sick time the employee has accrued but not used at various times. This important step will ensure that employees have the information they need to use their sick time appropriately.
The proposed rule prohibits a contractor’s interference with an employee’s accrual or use of paid sick time, as well as discrimination against an employee for using or attempting to use paid sick time, filing a complaint, cooperating in an investigation, or informing another of her rights. State and local paid sick days laws have similar protections. Such protections are fundamental, because without them, a worker’s right to earn paid sick time would be illusory. In the United States, nearly half of private sector workers (49 percent) who have paid sick time say their employers have progressive disciplinary policies that punish workers for using paid sick time; more than one-third report that they fear retaliation or abuse for using paid sick time.[xxviii]
Finally, the proposed rule contains reasonable enforcement provisions, allowing employees to file complaints with DOL’s Wage and Hour Division, and contains appropriate remedies including recovery of liquidated damages and the possibility of debarment for contractors who are found to have disregarded their obligations under the EO. Strong enforcement provisions are critical to protecting workers’ rights and discouraging contractors from violating the law.
III. Certain provisions of the proposed rule should be improved to further effectuate the purpose of the proposed rule and promote clarity.
The proposed rule unnecessarily limits the scope of service contracts it covers. Sections 6(d)(i)(A)-(B) of the EO indicate that the Order applies to, among other contracts, two types of service contracts. Section 6(d)(i)(A) refers to a “procurement contract for services or construction,” and Section (6)(d)(i)(B) refers to a “contract or contract-like instrument for services covered by the Service Contract Act” (SCA). We believe that the proposed rule unnecessarily limits the Order’s applicability, defining all service contracts covered by the EO as those covered by the SCA and thereby carving out “procurement contract[s] for services” that are not covered by the SCA.[xxix] These include service contracts performed exclusively by Fair Labor Standards Act-exempt employees, certain public utilities contracts, certain contracts for carriage by common carriers, and certain contracts with the U.S. Postal Service.[xxx] This narrower interpretation is not necessary, and the proposed rule could – and should – apply to procurement contracts for services beyond the scope of the SCA. The plain language of the Order does not require service contract coverage to be coextensive with the SCA. Sections 6(d)(i)(A) and (B) are drafted as separate provisions, with no indication that section 6(d)(i)(B) was intended to limit the scope of 6(d)(i)(A) to only those procurement contracts for services subject to the SCA.
The Order’s stated purpose of “[improving] the health and performance of employees of Federal contractors” and thus serving the Government’s twin goals of efficiency and economy is better served by extending coverage to the broadest possible set of employees covered by the Order. Limiting coverage to employees on SCA-covered service contracts removes several groups of employees from the Order’s important protections.
Contractors should not be able to limit employees to using accrued paid sick time when they otherwise would have been working on a covered contract, as this reduces worker flexibility and adds administrative complexity. The discussion of the proposed rule indicates that federal contractors are only obligated to allow employees to use accrued sick time during times when they would have been working on a federal contract. In practice, this means that employees who work on covered contracts as well as non-covered contracts, or who perform other work for their employer, could only use their accrued paid sick days at specific times. Illness doesn’t tell time or appear on a schedule, yet this interpretation requires the contractor – and the employee – to know ahead of time when the employee will be doing work on a covered contract so that the employee knows whether she can use a sick day and so the contractor can know whether to permit use of the day. For employees who work on a covered contract and perform other work on the same days or on an undefined schedule, tracking or predicting this will be difficult and imposes an administrative burden on contractors while also leaving workers uncertain as to whether they can use their paid sick time. If employees are unable to use their time when they are sick, the benefits of the rule – reduced workplace contagion and injury and improved productivity overall for the contractor – will also be lessened.                                                                
The provisions limiting accrual, available hours, use and carryover should be simplified for clarity and consistency. Currently, the proposed rule provides that:
·       A contractor may limit an employee’s annual accrual to 56 hours (“annual limit”);[xxxi]
·       An employee can carry over any unused time from one year to the next, and the amount carried over does not count toward the employee’s 56-hour annual accrual limit;[xxxii]
·       A contractor may limit the number of hours an employee can have available for use at any point to 56 hours (“availability limit”);[xxxiii] and
·       A contractor may not limit the amount of sick time an employee may use per year or at once.[xxxiv]
Allowing contractors to limit the total amount an employee can have available to use at any point will be confusing for contractors and employees alike. For example, an employee who carries over 16 hours of unused time would still be allowed to accrue up to 56 additional hours the following year, because the carried over hours do not count towards the employee’s total annual accrual limit. In effect, however, the employee would only accrue 40 more hours before hitting the 56-hour availability limit, and would not accrue additional hours until they used some of their available time. We suggest that DOL remove the availability limit, and instead permit contractors to cap the amount an employee can carry over from one year to the next at 56 hours. This would provide workers with the same maximum number of annual hours, but would eliminate the confusion of having two separate limits – one for annual accrual and one for availability for use.
DOL should further identify the ways in which a contractor must satisfy the requirements of the EO while also complying with a state or local paid sick days law. Section 13.5(f)(4) of the proposed rule states that a contractor does not satisfy their EO obligations merely by complying with a state or local paid sick days law. DOL should specify that a contractor subject to both the EO and a state or local law must provide time that meets or exceeds the requirements of the Order as to accrual, conditions and purposes for use, and other essential aspects of the Order. Greater clarity on this issue would help both contractors and employees know their responsibilities and rights.
IV. Conclusion
We strongly support the proposed rule, which will guarantee more workers the job and economic security that paid sick days provide, reduce workplace contagion and increase productivity and retention, leading to greater economy and efficiency in federal contracting and cost savings to the government, taxpayers and employers. When implemented, this rule will also add to the growing body of evidence that demonstrates the clear benefits of paid sick days and the need for a national standard. We applaud the administration for leading the way on this issue and urge swift implementation of a final rule.

"Over the last ten years, a growing number of cities and states passed laws limiting the use of credit checks in hiring, promotion, and firing. Lawmakers are motivated by a number of well-founded concerns: although credit history is not relevant to employment, employment credit checks create barriers to opportunity and upward mobility, can exacerbate racial discrimination, and can lead to invasions of privacy. This report examines the effectiveness of the employment credit check laws enacted so far and finds that unjustified exemptions included in the laws, a failure to pursue enforcement, and a lack of public outreach have prevented these important employment protections from being as effective as they could be.

Over the last ten years, a growing number of cities and states passed laws limiting the use of personal credit history in employment, also known as employment credit checks. Lawmakers are motivated by a number of well-founded concerns: although credit history is not relevant to employment, employment credit checks create barriers to opportunity and upward mobility, can exacerbate racial discrimination, and can lead to invasions of privacy. States laws to limit employer credit checks were enacted in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington. Delaware has also restricted the use of credit checks in hiring for public employment. Cities, including New York City and Chicago, have restricted credit checks as well.1 In 2014 there were 39 state bills introduced or pending aimed at limiting the use of credit checks in employment decisions, as well as federal legislation proposed in the House and Senate.2 This report examines the impact of the credit check laws enacted so far, considers barriers to their effectiveness and discusses strategies to increase protections for workers. 
In researching this report, Demos conducted a search of legal databases Westlaw and Lexis Nexis for cases brought under each statute, queried enforcement officials in each state about complaints and enforcement actions taken under the law, and contacted legislators for their impressions on the effectiveness of the legislation. We begin by looking more closely at the practice of employment credit checks and exploring the motivation for restrictions.
 
Credit checks are widely used by employers making hiring decisions.3 The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) also permits employers to request credit reports on existing employees for decisions on promoting or firing workers.4 While employers generally cannot access three-digit credit scores, they can obtain credit reports that include information on mortgage debt; data on student loans; amounts of car payments; details on credit card accounts including balances, credit limits, and monthly payments; bankruptcy records; bills, including medical debts, that are in collection; and tax liens. Under the statute, employers must first obtain written permission from the individual whose credit report they seek to review. Employers are also required to notify individuals before they take “adverse action” (in this case, failing to hire, promote or retain an employee) based in whole or in part on any information in the credit report. The employer is required to offer a copy of the credit report and a written summary of the consumer’s rights along with this notification. After providing job applicants with a short period of time (typically three to five business days) to identify and begin disputing any errors in their credit report, employers may then take action based on the report and must once again notify the job applicant. 
Credit reports were developed to help lenders assess the risks associated with making a loan. Over the last few years, they have been aggressively marketed to employers as a means to gauge an applicant’s moral character, reliability or likelihood to commit theft or fraud. While the practice of checking credit may appear benign, a growing body of research suggests that credit checks do not accurately measure employment-related characteristics and may instead bar many qualified workers from employment. A 2013 Demos report found that 1 in 10 unemployed workers in a low or middle-income household with credit card debt were denied a job because of a credit check.5
Why Restrict Employment Credit Checks?
Credit checks bar qualified workers from jobs because poor credit is associated with unemployment, medical debt and lack of health coverage, which tell very little about personal job performance, but rather reveal systemic injustice, individual bad luck, and the impact of a weak economy.6 The financial crisis and the Great Recession caused millions of Americans to be laid off from their jobs, see their home values plummet to less than their mortgage debt, and find their savings and retirement accounts decimated – all of which can affect credit history. Even seven years after the initial stock market crash, wages for all but the top 95th income percentile have not recovered.7 Though job markets have recovered to some extent, the recovery has been slow and many Americans have been left behind.8 These are largely factors that are outside an individual’s control and have no reflection on someone’s “moral character” or their ability to adequately perform their job. Rather, credit checks are unfair and discriminate against the long-term unemployed and other disadvantaged groups, creating a barrier to upward mobility. 
Because of the legacy of predatory lending and racial discrimination, people of color tend to have lower credit ratings than whites, and so may be disproportionately likely to be denied a job because of a credit check.9 A persistent legacy of discriminatory lending, hiring, and housing policies has left people of color with worse credit, on average, than white households.10 In recent years, historic disparities have been compounded by predatory lending schemes that targeted low-income communities and communities of color, putting them at greater risk of foreclosure and default on loans, further damaging their credit.11 By evaluating prospective employees based on credit, employment credit checks can further extend this injustice.
Worryingly, credit reports are often riddled with errors. A Demos study of low- and middle-income households carrying credit card debt finds that 1 in 8 respondents who have poor credit cite “errors in my credit report” for their credit problems.12 A Federal Trade Commission (FTC) study finds that five percent of consumers, amounting to 45 million Americans, had errors on at least one of their three major credit reports.13 A follow-up study finds that majorities of these consumers still have outstanding errors on their credit report.14 A 2011 industry-funded study by the Policy and Economic Research Council (PERC), found that 1 in 5 people who reviewed their credit report found incorrect information and 12.1 percent of those errors could have a material impact on their score.15 As a result of employment credit checks, individuals can be disqualified from job because of a credit report that is not even factual.16 As the New York Times editorial board noted, “the interest around this issue shows that more law makers are starting to realize how this unfair practice damages the lives and job prospects of millions of people.”17
 
The invasion of privacy is another concern when personal credit information is used in employment. Not only do credit reports reveal a great deal about an individual’s personal financial history, they also provide a window into even more deeply private matters such as medical history, divorce, and cases of domestic abuse. For example, surveys find that when a credit check is conducted, employers often ask individuals with flawed credit to explain why they are behind on their bills.18 Given that past due medical bills make up the majority of accounts reported by collection agencies, many prospective employees will feel obliged to discuss their otherwise confidential medical histories as a pre-requisite for obtaining employment. Since divorce and domestic abuse are other leading causes of credit struggles, a discussion of these often painful and deeply private personal issues can also become compulsory if an job-seeker is asked to “explain” their poor credit to a prospective employer.
 
Concerns about employment credit checks led to numerous state laws to limit them: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington have all passed legislation. In 2014, Delaware passed a more limited law preventing public employers from using credit checks for employment decisions.19 Chicago has also passed a law prohibiting credit checks from being used in employment decisions.20 More recently, New York City banned credit checks, and made an effort to limit exemptions (see page 16).21 There is evidence that there is broader interest, however, since thirty-nine bills in 19 states were introduced in 2014.22 In addition, legislation has been presented at the federal level, including a bill by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (in the Senate) and Rep. Steven Cohen (in the House).23 This report explores the effectiveness of the credit check laws, and finds that lack of clear enforcement mechanism, exemptions and a robust public outreach effort have all undermined the effectiveness of credit check laws. 
 
New research by Robert Clifford at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and Daniel Shoag at Harvard University’s Kennedy School suggests that credit check laws are effective at increasing employment among job applicants with poor credit.24 Drawing on credit bureau and employment data, the authors find that state laws banning credit checks increase overall employment in low-credit census tracts by between 2.3 and 3.3 percent. Despite exemptions that enable employers to continue conducting credit checks for many job categories, the authors find that credit check laws also led to a significant 7 to 11 percent reduction in employer use of credit checks.25The largest impact on jobs was found in the public sector, followed by employment in transportation and warehousing, information, and in-home services. 
The authors find that as the use of credit information in hiring declined, employers elevated other employment criteria, increasingly requiring college degrees or additional work experience. Given that these factors contain more relevant information about job performance than credit checks, this is a step forward.26 However, inflating job requirements beyond what a given position genuinely demands may present its own problems, erecting new and unnecessary barriers to employment. Inflating employment criteria may help to explain a troubling finding of the study: African-American workers experience slightly worse employment outcomes relative to white workers in states that have restricted employment credit checks. The authors of the study have acknowledged a number of uncontrolled variables (such as the over-representation of African Americans in public employment in states that have enacted employment credit check restrictions) may have skewed this result.27 Nevertheless, it raises an important warning: credit check laws by themselves cannot eliminate employment discrimination, and policymakers must remain alert for the resurgence of discriminatory practices. 
 
While state laws were ostensibly enacted to prevent employment credit checks from becoming an employment barriers for qualified workers, we find that these laws have been undermined by the numerous broad exemptions they contain. Currently, all state credit check laws include exemptions – job categories where credit checks continue to be permitted even as the law bans credit checks for other positions. Because these exemptions are often vague and cover large categories of workers, they have reduced the effectiveness of state laws. The most common exemptions are provisions that allow for a credit check if it is “substantially job related” or the employer is a financial institution. Other laws contain exemptions permitting credit checks for management positions, law enforcement jobs, or employees with access to cash or goods. 
In an analysis of exemptions in state credit check laws, James Phillips and David Schein argue that states restricting employment credit checks “have virtually gutted those restrictions by exception.”28 Legislators themselves have expressed concern about the significant exemptions that were ultimately included in the laws. In Vermont, Helen Head, Chair of the Committee on General, Housing & Military Affairs tells Demos that, “We are concerned that the large number of exceptions may make it more difficult to limit the practice of employer credit checks.  In hindsight, I wish we had worked even harder than we did to limit the broad exclusions that were passed in the Vermont bill.” Vermont Representative Kesha Ram echoed the sentiment, noting that, “we included a number of exemptions in terms of types of employment and that these may limit the effectiveness of the law.” These exemptions both make it more difficult for employees to know whether they can seek damages, and also more difficult for courts to rule in their favor. Further, exemptions can hamper enforcement, by making it more risky for the government agency tasked with enforcement to determine whether there has been a violation. 
 
While these exceptions appear to have deeply hampered the effectiveness of these laws, their merit is dubious. The section below examines these exemptions and shows why most are unjustified and unnecessary.
As Phillips and Schein note, “nearly every state has articulated specific job-related requirements that make clear when these exceptions are applicable and under what circumstances they will provide an employer with legally sufficient grounds to make a credit history check a requirement or condition of the employment.” They further note that, “exceptions to the ten state statutes have virtually swallowed those states’ legal prohibitions [indicating] that under state law, an employer is virtually free to utilize credit reports to make employment decisions.”35
 
States have a range of enforcement mechanisms for laws restricting employment credit checks. Some states give enforcement authority to the Department of Labor/Labor Commission (Connecticut, Colorado, Maryland, Nevada, Oregon) others to the Attorney General (Washington), one to the Department of Fair Employment and Housing (California), and one to the Civil Rights Commissioner (Hawaii) and Vermont splits enforcement between two agencies. In addition, Hawaii, Illinois, Nevada, Oregon and Vermont allow employees or jobseekers harmed by violations of the law to bring a private lawsuit against the violator. One significant shortcoming of many state enforcement efforts is that states are making little investment in investigating employment and hiring practices to detect violations of the law. Instead, the burden is placed on employees and job-seekers who had their credit checked in violation of the law to file a complaint before any action can be taken. Because potential employees may not know a violation has occurred, or even know that they are protected from employment credit checks, placing the burden on employees makes it far more likely that these laws will go unenforced. 
Demos contacted state officials for insight on how these laws are being enforced.
Hawaii, Illinois, Nevada, Oregon and Vermont allow employees or jobseekers harmed by violations of the law to bring a private lawsuit against the violator. A search of Westlaw and Lexis Nexis returned no cases of individuals pursuing suits in these states.
 
Since states depend on public complaints to initiate an investigation and enforcement of their employment credit check laws, public awareness of the laws among employees and job seekers is critical to preventing the legislation from becoming a dead letter. It is equally essential that employers are aware of the law and understand their responsibilities so that they can comply. Demos asked state agencies responsible for enforcing the laws about any public awareness or outreach efforts surrounding the laws. No state pursued an advertising campaign (although see page 16 for details about the New York City law, which included a model outreach campaign). Yet some states pursued more outreach than others. It is notable that Colorado, which reported the greatest number of complaints under the employment credit checks law, was also among the states that reported a more vigorous public outreach effort to help workers and employers understand rights and responsibilities under the law.
No other states could point to specific media outreach. 
A look at other types of employment legislation underscores the importance of broad public awareness. For example, a study of New York City workers finds that employers frequently shirk common labor protections like the minimum wage.37 One study of workers in Chicago, New York City and Los Angeles stunningly finds that 76 percent of workers “were not paid the legally required overtime rate.”38 A study of Philadelphia’s Restaurant Industry finds that 61.5 percent of workers surveyed “did not know the correct legal minimum wage.”39 Regarding illegal pay secrecy policies, Craig Becker, general counsel for the AFL-CIO tells The Atlantic that, “The problem isn’t so much that the remedies are inadequate, but that so few workers know their rights.”40 
 
New York City’s Stop Credit Discrimination in Employment Act was signed into law by Mayor Bill de Blasio on May 6, 2015 and went into effect on September 3, 2015. The legislation, sponsored by City Council-member Brad Lander, amends the City’s Human Rights Law to make it an unlawful discriminatory practice for an employer to use an individual’s consumer credit history in making employment decisions. While New York’s law is too new to be evaluated for its effectiveness, the narrowness of the bill’s exemptions, the robust public awareness campaign, and strong enforcement mechanisms make it the strongest restriction on employment credit checks enacted anywhere in the U.S. at the time of this report’s publication. However, exemptions that were added to the law as the result of political negotiations should not be considered a model for other jurisdictions. 
Employment credit checks are a discriminatory barrier to employment. Our research suggests that states motivated to curtail this practice can enact more effective legislation by:
The use of employment credit checks creates barriers to opportunity and upward mobility, exacerbates racial discrimination, and can lead to invasions of privacy. Yet because of unjustified exemptions in the laws, lack of public awareness, and a dearth of proactive enforcement, laws against credit checks have not been as effective as they should be. Nevertheless, despite inconsistent coverage and enforcement, laws may have deterred credit checks. The number of employers reporting that they used credit checks when hiring for some or all positions fell from 60 percent in 2010 to 47 percent in 2012, according to the Society for Human Resources Management.41 Both the laws, and the lack of evidence that credit checks are effective have been cited as reasons for the decline.42 Research suggests the laws reduced the use of credit checks by between 7 and 11%.43 However, it is worrying that nearly a decade since the first law was passed, Demos has failed to find evidence that a single employer fined for using an illegal credit check on a prospective employee.",research
"“I make $1,000 for the store in 30 minutes. But I don’t make $1,000 in a month working there.”
The quote is a paraphrase of a Victoria’s Secret worker. She, like 500 other retail and fast food employees in and around the Chicago Loop, isn’t at work today. They’re all on strike. (Follow #strikefor15 for the latest and photos)
Building on the powerful example of Walmart workers who walked off the job  last fall and New York City fast food workers  who took action earlier this month, employees of major retailers like Macy’s, Sears, and Victoria’s Secret, as well as fast food outlets from Dunkin Donuts to Subway have taken to the streets. Organized by the Workers Organizing Committee of Chicago with support from  a wide range of community and worker organizations, workers are demanding respect at work, the right to form a union without employer interference, and what they describe as a livable wage for the Chicago area:  $15 an hour.
Impressively, the strike brings together workers not only across employers but across industries, looping in two of the nation’s fastest growing occupations: jobs in retail sales and in food service. Both are low-wage industries with erratic scheduling that makes it difficult to make ends meet or organize one’s life.
In her recent analysis of the retail industry,  Demos analyst Catherine Ruetschlin found that raising wages in the retail industry nationwide would lift families out of poverty,  stimulate economic growth,   and even boost sales to retailers themselves. While she did not analyze Chicago workers’ $15 an hour demand specifically, Ruetschlin found that large retailers could easily afford a substantial raise over current wages and that price increases to consumers would be negligible. 
Workers are facing a steep uphill fight, but today's action is promising, as Josh Eidelson writes today in Salon:
The strike wave’s spread to Chicago offers a hopeful sign for the New York City fast food campaign. While individual fast food stores are managed by franchisees, national CEOs are the real decision-makers in both fast food and retail. Given the financial cost and, more important, the risk of setting a precedent and emboldening a wider workforce, it’s hard to imagine executives for McDonald’s or Macy’s making any significant concessions to workers in any city unless faced with a bona fide national uprising. For that to happen, the strikes would have to go viral, big-time.",blog
"This report reveals the extent of credit information “mission creep,” examines troubling shortcomings in the for-profit credit reporting industry, and recommends common sense steps to reform the credit reporting system.
Credit reports and scores have a direct and growing impact on Americans’ economic security and opportunity. Having poor credit can mean a consumer will end up paying a higher interest rate for a loan or a higher premium for car or homeowner’s insurance; have their application for a loan or insurance denied; be turned down for a job, or even be terminated from their current one. Credit history can affect the way Americans are treated by landlords, utility companies, and hospitals.

"Why employment credit checks constitute an illegitimate barrier to employment.
Today, it is common for employers to look at job applicants’ personal credit history before making a hiring decision. A wide range of positions, from high-level financial posts to jobs doing maintenance work, offering telephone tech support, working as a delivery driver or selling frozen yogurt, may require a credit check. Yet despite their prevalence, little is known about what credit checks actually reveal to employers, what the consequences are for job applicants, or employment credit checks’ overall impact on our society. This report uses new data from Demos’ 2012 National Survey on Credit Card Debt in Low- and Middle- Income Households to address these questions. Overall, we find substantial evidence that employment credit checks constitute an illegitimate barrier to employment.
Among low- and middle-income households carrying credit card debt:
We conclude that employment credit checks illegitimately obstruct access to employment, often for the very job applicants who need work the most.
 
Today, it is common for employers to look at job applicants’ personal credit history before making hiring decisions. According to a survey of human resources professionals, nearly half of employers check an employee’s credit history when hiring for some or all positions.1
The practice is hardly limited to high-level management positions: even a brief look at a popular job listing website reveals that employers require credit checks for jobs as diverse as doing maintenance work, offering telephone tech support, assisting in an office, working as a delivery driver, selling insurance, laboring as a home care aide, supervising a stockroom and serving frozen yogurt.2 Some employers also conduct credit checks on existing employees, often when they are considering a promotion.
Yet despite their prevalence, little is known about what credit checks actually reveal to employers, what the consequences are for job applicants, or employment credit checks’ overall impact on our society. This paper, drawing on new data from Demos’ 2012 National Survey on Credit Card Debt in Low- and Middle- Income Households, a nationally-representative survey of 997 low and middle-income American households who carry credit card debt,3 addresses these questions and finds substantial evidence that employment credit checks constitute an illegitimate barrier to employment.
Credit reports were not designed as an employment screening tool. Instead, they were developed as a means for lenders to evaluate whether a would-be borrower would be a good credit risk: by looking at someone’s history of paying their debts, lenders decide whether to make a loan and on what terms. Accordingly, credit reports include not only an individual’s name, address, previous addresses, and social security number, but also information on mortgage debt; data on student loans; amounts of car payments; details on credit card accounts including balances, credit limits, and monthly payments; bankruptcy records; bills, including medical debts, that are in collection; and tax liens. Credit reports may be purchased by employers through any number of companies that offer employment background checks (which also may include checks of criminal records or other public data) but the credit portion of the report is typically supplied by one of three large global corporations: Equifax, Experian, and Transunion, which are also known as consumer reporting agencies (CRAs). Credit scores —another product used by lenders which consists of a single number calculated on the basis of information in a credit report—are not typically provided to employers.
Employment credit checks are legal under federal law. The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) permits employers to request credit reports on job applicants and existing employees.4 Under the statute, employers must first obtain written permission from the individual whose credit report they seek to review. Employers are also required to notify individuals before they take “adverse action” (in this case, failing to hire, promote or retain an employee) based in whole or in part on any information in the credit report. The employer is required to offer a copy of the credit report and a written summary of the consumer’s rights along with this notification. After providing job applicants with a short period of time (typically three to five business days) to identify and begin disputing any errors in their credit report, employers may then take action based on the report and must once again notify the job applicant.
These consumer protections are important, yet they are far from sufficient to prevent credit checks from becoming a barrier to employment. Employers can reject any job applicant who refuses a credit check. And while a growing number of state laws restrict the circumstances under which an employer can discriminate against job applicants on the basis of credit history (see endnotes for a list of state statutes), federal law permits employers to use credit history as a basis for denying employment.5
 
No official source collects and disseminates information on the number of job applicants subjected to credit checks as a condition of employment. The most commonly cited statistic on the frequency of employment credit checks comes from the Society for Human Resources Management (SHRM), which finds 47 percent of employers conduct credit checks on some or all job applicants.6 But this statistic, based on a survey of fewer than 400 employers, fails to explain how many employees are actually subjected to credit checks, or the likelihood that a job seeker will be required to consent to one in order to be considered for a job. Our survey of low- and middle-income households carrying credit card debt finds that approximately 1 in 7 of these households recall being asked by an employer or prospective employer to authorize a credit check. About the same proportion say they don’t know whether they’ve ever been asked for an employment credit check.
Among those survey respondents who are unemployed, the memories are fresher: 1 in 4 recall that a potential employer has requested to check their credit report as part of a job application.
Yet there is reason to believe that the actual prevalence of employment credit checks may be higher still: in the flurry of paperwork that often surrounds the job application process, applicants may quickly forget the specifics of the many documents they signed. In addition, the prevalence of credit checks is likely to be greater among the higher-income households excluded from our survey, since SHRM finds that employers are more likely to conduct credit checks for senior executive positions and jobs with significant financial responsibility, positions likely to be so well paid as to push household income outside the bounds of our survey in many cases.
To represent a truly widespread barrier to employment, credit checks must not only be widely conducted, but actually become a basis for losing job opportunities. We find that 1 in 10 participants in our survey who are unemployed have been informed that they would not be hired for a job because of the information in their credit report. Among job applicants with blemished credit histories, 1 in 7 has been advised that they were not being hired because of their credit.7
However, the true number may be higher still: while the FCRA requires employers to provide official notification when a credit report played a role in the decision not to hire someone, compliance with this provision is difficult to oversee. In the unlikely event that they are investigated, employers who don’t want to bother with FCRA-mandated disclosures can falsely claim that the credit report was not a factor in their decision not hire an employee. Again, the fact that our survey included only low- and middle-income households may also understate the proportion of total job applicants rejected by employers because of their poor credit.
 
Among the low- and middle-income households with credit card debt in our sample, we find that poor or declining credit is associated with households experiencing job loss, lacking health coverage, or having medical debt. We also find that households containing children are more likely to report poor or declining credit.
It’s easy to understand how having an income-earner in one’s household out of work for an extended period of time might make it more difficult to keep up with bills and thus to maintain good credit. We find that households coping with prolonged unemployment were more likely than others in our sample to have other household members work extra hours or get an additional job, borrow money from family and friends, dip into retirement savings, or sell valuable items such as a car or jewelry to deal with unexpected expenses. But these measures were not always enough: 31 percent of households who have had a member out of work for two months or longer in the past three years say their credit score has declined over the same period of time, compared to just 22 percent of those who haven’t experienced extended unemployment in their household. Similarly people from households with someone out of work in the past three years are more likely to describe their credit as “poor” and less likely to describe it as “good” or “excellent” than those that haven’t experienced extended unemployment in their household.
Moreover, people with low credit scores are significantly more likely to have incurred expenses related to job loss over the past three years. Nearly half (45 percent) of those with credit scores below 620 say they have incurred expenses relating to the loss of a job in the last three years. This compares with just 19 percent of those with scores over 700. Unsurprisingly, it appears much easier to maintain good credit if you are not coping with extended unemployment.
It makes little sense to say that someone is not a good candidate for a job because they are still coping with the expense of a costly family medical emergency several years ago. Yet this may be exactly the type of situation that a blemished credit history indicates: having unpaid medical bills or medical debt is cited as one of the leading causes of bad credit among survey respondents who say their credit is poor, with more than half citing medical bills as a factor. Households that report low credit scores are more likely to have medical debt on their credit cards than those with good credit. In addition, more than half of those with self-reported credit scores under 620 also have medical debt that’s not on their credit cards. A lack of health coverage is also a factor in poor credit: in our sample, households that include someone without health coverage are more than twice as likely to report that their credit score has declined a lot in the past three years.

Our findings about the prevalence of medical debt parallel those of previous studies. The Commonwealth Fund found that in 2007, 41 percent of working-age adults had accrued medical debt or reported a problem paying their medical bills.8 Similarly, a Federal Reserve study found that the credit reports of about 15.7 percent of middle-income people and nearly 23 percent of low-income people included collection accounts for medical debt.9 The vast majority of these individuals had lower credit scores as a result. The most startling statistic is that Federal Reserve Board researchers found that 52 percent of all accounts reported by collection agencies consisted of medical debt.10 Poor credit tells a story of medical misfortune far more convincingly than one of poor work habits.
Finally, raising children appears to have a negative association with credit scores, as households with one or more children at home are more likely to report poor credit. Twenty-three percent of indebted households raising children describe their credit scores as poor, compared to 12 percent among indebted households without kids. These numbers correlate to reported scores: 25 percent of households who have children at home and know their credit scores within a range classify their credit score below 620, compared 13 percent of households without children at home. Instead, households without children are more likely to have scores at the top of the ranking, with 17 percent of these households reporting a credit score of 800 or higher, compared to 5 percent in this category among indebted households with children living at home.
 
Our survey found that households of color are at a serious disadvantage when it comes to credit history. While the majority of low- and middle-income white households with credit card debt report good or excellent credit, the opposite is true for African Americans. Sixty-five percent of white households in our sample describe their credit scores as good or excellent, much higher than the 44 percent of African American households who identify in the good or excellent categories. In contrast, over half of African American households fall into the range of fair and poor credit. Among households with credit card debt who know their credit score within a range, just 15 percent of white households in our sample have credit scores below 620, compared to more than a third of African American households. Most white households (59 percent) report scores of 700 or above, displaying strong credit, while less than one quarter of African Americans (24 percent) are able to attain the same high credit rating status. Our findings are consistent with previous research on the racial gap in credit scores, including studies by Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Trade Commission and the Brookings Institution.11
The credit histories of Latinos and African Americans have suffered as a result of discrimination in lending, housing and employment itself. This legacy of discrimination has also resulted in a large and growing racial wealth gap: in 2009, the median wealth of white households was 20 times that of black households and 18 times that of Hispanic households.12 With substantially less wealth to draw on, households of color are forced to borrow to deal with emergencies at times when white households can fall back on their savings. At the same time, predatory lending schemes in the last decade targeted communities of color, compounding historic disparities in wealth and assets, and leaving African-Americans, Latinos, and other people of color at greater risk of foreclosure and default on loans. Employment credit checks can perpetuate and amplify this injustice, translating a legacy of unfair lending into another subtle means of employment discrimination.
The racially discriminatory potential of employment credit checks is the key reason that civil rights organizations such as the NAACP, the National Council of La Raza, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, and the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights under Law have publicly opposed the use of employment credit checks.13 In general, civil rights law mandates that employers justify the appropriateness of an employment practice if it creates a disparate impact on a group historically subject to workplace discrimination. Although specific cases of discrimination can be difficult to prove, some high-profile suits have been won. For example, the Department of Labor won a case in 2010 against Bank of America in which the bank was found to have discriminated against African-Americans by using credit checks to hire entry-level employees. A significantly higher proportion of African-American candidates (11.5 percent) were excluded because of the credit check than white candidates (6.6 percent).14
The frequency of errors in credit reports is another reason why credit reports are not reliable for employment. In our sample,12 percent of respondents who say that they have poor credit assert that errors in their credit report were a contributing factor. This rate of errors should be considered in the light of other major research on the subject. In February 2013, the Federal Trade Commission released the results of a comprehensive study of credit reporting errors, finding that 21 percent of American consumers had an error on a credit report from at least one of the three major credit reporting companies.15 Thirteen percent of consumers had errors serious enough to change their credit score. Ultimately about five percent of consumers (an estimated 10 million Americans) had errors that could lead to them paying more for credit products, such as auto loans, mortgages or credit cards.
However, the impact of credit reporting errors on employment is far more difficult to assess. Unlike lenders, employers do not look at a hard number like a credit score but rather subjectively assess the credit report’s list of accounts, subjectively deciding how much weight they give to elements such as foreclosures, late bills, or accounts in collection. What looks significant to one employer might not seem important to another. Thus a credit reporting mistake that is too small to make a difference in applying for credit might nevertheless stand out to an employer and cost someone a job.
Unfortunately, the safeguards included in the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) to protect job-seekers from credit reporting errors have not always proven to be sufficient. Although employers are required to notify job applicants before implementing a decision not to hire them based in any part on information from a credit report, employer compliance with this rule is difficult to monitor or enforce. As a result, job applicants may never realize that they were not hired because of their credit report and further may not realize that their credit report contains errors. In addition, the process of resolving credit reporting errors is deeply flawed, with the credit reporting agencies using an automated dispute resolution process that consumers describe as “Kafkaesque.”
A recent New York Times report illustrates how, in practice, credit reporting errors can stymie job searches in spite of the FCRA’s putative protections. The article tells the story of Maria Ortiz, who, after years of steady employment, spent nearly two years looking for work and was still unable to land a job despite assistance from a workforce development agency:
Ms. Ortiz was baffled by the repeated rejections until her caseworker checked her credit report. Everything made sense then: it showed that damaging, faulty information had been added to her report.
“It said I owe over $75,000 and that I have two cars,” Ms. Ortiz squealed. “I don’t drive! It said I have a mortgage. I don’t have a house!”
Quickly realizing that she needed to correct the false information, Ms. Ortiz and her caseworker sent letters to more than 20 companies and the credit bureaus to set straight which debts were veritably hers.
“I did have a lot of credit cards, but I always paid them on time,” she said. “I only had $500 of credit card debt, maybe less, and they weren’t outstanding.” Her credit reputation has since been restored, and she has achieved a nearly perfect TransUnion score, 798, but the blemish on her record took several months to reverse and was not without consequences.
In the summer of 2010, Ms. Ortiz went to a second interview for a position as a bank teller on Long Island.
“I thought I was going to get the job, but they ran my report and told me no,” she said. Despite the letters Ms. Ortiz had sent out, her report still reflected incorrect information.16
Ms. Ortiz’s story is instructive. It is impossible to know how many of the jobs she applied for over the years rejected her as a result of incorrect credit information while the employers simply did not provide the notification required under the FCRA. At minimum, it appears that the bank teller position did not provide the required opportunity to address the already-disputed errors in her credit report before rejecting her for the job. Finally, it is revealing that even with the help of a dedicated case worker, it took Ms. Ortiz months to fix errors in her credit report. As a practical matter, disputing an error can be a time-consuming, nearly impossible three-party negotiation between the credit bureau, the creditor and the individual—a negotiation for which the outcome is ultimately controlled by the sometimes arbitrary decision of the agency.17
 
Employment credit checks are an illegitimate barrier to employment, often for the very job applicants who need work the most. Many government entities, from local city councils to federal agencies, can take action to reduce the prevalence of employment credit checks and otherwise mitigate their negative impact.
We recommend the following:
As of February 2013, eight states (California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Oregon, Vermont and Washington) have passed legislation to restrict the use of credit checks in employment and dozens of additional cities and states have introduced bills to do so. As the New York Times editorial board noted, “the interest around this issue shows that more law makers are starting to realize how this unfair practice damages the lives and job prospects of millions of people.”18 At the same time, however, these laws include numerous exemptions that allow certain employers to continue conducting credit checks even when there is no evidence that credit history is relevant to job performance. Accordingly, states that have already restricted employment credit checks should tighten their laws and eliminate exemptions. Other states and cities should take action to ban credit checks.
Before the state of Connecticut enacted its restrictions on employment credit checks, the city of Hartford led the way by eliminating credit checks for all municipal hiring. This is an excellent policy choice for cities and counties that are prohibited by state law from regulating private employers: by changing their own hiring practices, these jurisdictions can directly remove a barrier to public employment for citizens with impaired credit and send a message to private firms about the shortcomings of employment credit checks.
Representative Steve Cohen introduced the Equal Employment for All Act (H.R. 645). This legislation would amend the Fair Credit Reporting Act to prohibit the use of employment credit checks. This legislation was endorsed by The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the NAACP, the National Council of La Raza, the National Partnership for Women and Families, the AFL-CIO and dozens of other civil rights, employment, and consumer advocacy organizations. The bill should be passed and signed into law.
Currently many federal agencies require credit checks as part of their determination of suitability for federal employment. Credit checks are supposed to be used as a means to ascertain deliberate financial irresponsibility, but in practice job applicants with poor credit due to any circumstance may be disqualified from employment. Federal agencies should stop using credit checks in their own hiring, with possible exceptions for positions requiring national security clearance.
The CFPB should use its new supervisory authority to ensure that credit reporting agencies reduce the incidence of errors on credit reports and improve their dispute resolution procedures. While these measures will not directly prevent the use of credit checks for employment purposes, they will reduce the chances that job applicants subject to credit checks are denied a job due to errors on their reports.
While there is little or no evidence that any data on personal credit history is relevant to employment, some categories of information on credit reports are particularly pernicious because they represent disputed information, invasions of medical privacy, and/or a repeat discrimination against those who have already been victimized by predatory lending.
Medical debt, disputed accounts, and defaults on unsafe financial products not only fail to predict employment behavior but also may also fail to predict a consumers’ behavior as a borrower.
Accordingly the CFPB should act to ensure that:
The FCRA mandates that employers obtain a job applicant’s authorization before requesting a credit report and notify job applicants if the employer plans to take adverse action (such as rejecting a job application or denying a promotion) due in any part to information on a credit report. As noted before, compliance with these provisions is difficult to oversee, since without notification an employee would have no way of knowing that they were rejected due to their credit history. Nevertheless, the Federal Trade Commission should aggressively pursue tips and seek out ways to enforce the law.
In 2012 the FTC settled charges with online data broker Spokeo for marketing consumer information to human resources people and recruiting agencies in ways that violated the FCRA. The FTC should continue to enforce the law vigorously.
Our research is just the latest study to demonstrate that people of color are disproportionately likely to report poor credit, strongly suggesting that employment credit checks have a disparate impact on African Americans and other groups protected by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Indeed, the Department of Labor won a case against Bank of America in which the bank was found to have discriminated against African Americans by using credit checks to hire entry-level employees.19 Since little or no evidence exists that credit history is meaningfully predictive of job performance for any position, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) should issue formal guidance that bars the use of credit history for employment purposes.
Our research supports the contention that employment credit checks can create an untenable catch-22 for jobseekers: they are unable to secure a job because of damaged credit and unable to escape debt and improve their credit because they cannot find work. But the fundamental unfairness of the situation goes a step further: we find that poor credit history is associated with factors such as race, unemployment status, parenting responsibilities, and medical debt that have not been justified as reasons to make hiring decisions and – in the case of racial discrimination in hiring – are illegal in the United States. Accordingly, we conclude that credit history illegitimately obstructs access to employment. Many Americans seem to agree: when we asked our sample of low- and middle-income workers with credit card debt whether employers should be able to look at a job applicant’s credit report, 75 percent said no.",research
"People of color suffer direct and damaging impacts from laws, policies, and practices that exclude them from full and equal participation in the labor market and the workplace. So far in this blog series, I’ve looked at two damaging effects of workplace social exclusion: the persistently higher unemployment rates faced by African American and Latino workers and the unequal pay and benefits offered to black women. It’s clear that people of color suffer the greatest harm from racist social exclusion, yet white workers also experience negative effects.
As Connie Razza points out in her  framing paper on social exclusion: “the racist appeals at the root of social exclusion redirect blame not only for the era’s racial disparities, but also for economic inequality overall. In the end, many of the policies that are sold through racist appeals to white people hurt working and poor people of all races, and benefit the already powerful and wealthy few.”
Working Americans as a whole lose when powerful people – such as large, low-wage employers and the politicians and apologists  protecting their interests – deploy the idea that workers of color are less deserving of good jobs in order to undermine policy that would benefit working people of all races. One example is raising wages for people working at the lowest ranks of the labor market.
The reality is that while a larger proportion of black and Latino workers are paid the minimum wage, the majority of workers making the minimum are white. Similarly, if Congress raised the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, the majority (53.5 percent) of workers who would be benefit would be white. Employers would be compelled to raise wages for an estimated 22 million white workers. Yet businesses focused on maximizing their own profits at the expense of their workforce have consistently benefitted from racist rationales to undermine efforts to raise the minimum wage.
In fact, some of the earliest opposition to the federal minimum wage stemmed from white supremacist fearmongering about its threat racial hierarchy. Testifying in 1937 against the federal Fair Labor Standards Act that implemented the first federal minimum wage, Representative J. Mark Wilcox of Florida insisted, “There has always been a difference in the wage scale of white and colored labor… You cannot put the Negro and the white man on the same basis and get away with it.” Wilcox linked the establishment of a federal minimum wage to efforts to combat lynching, regarding both as violations of “states’ rights” that would upset the existing racial order. Guaranteeing equal minimum pay to black workers was dangerous because it would imply that their labors had equal value and dignity. Yet had these racist fears prevailed and thwarted the Fair Labor Standards Act, neither white workers nor workers of color would have enjoyed the benefits of a higher wage floor.   
Even as a federal minimum wage was enacted, lawmakers excluded occupations that predominantly employed African-American workers, including agricultural workers, domestic workers, and home care workers who care for the ill, the elderly, and people with disabilities. In the 80 years since the passage of the Fair Labor Standards Act, people working in these industries –still primarily people of color – have only gradually won the right to be included in minimum wage and other core workplace protections.
Today racial anxiety continues to undermine white support for a minimum wage increase that would benefit millions of white workers. As my Sean McElwee found in his analysis of a 2016 survey, white people who were more “racially conservative” (for example, agreeing that “racial problems in the U.S. are rare, isolated situations”) were less supportive of policies to raise the minimum wage, even after controlling for political party and a host of other factors such as family income, gender, ideology, decreasing household income and recent job loss. McElwee made that case that the minimum wage was one of many examples of how racial animosity can reduce support for progressive economic policies. The exclusionary idea that people of color do not deserve good jobs can effectively block policies that would benefit all working people. 
In my final post on social exclusion, I will illustrate the way that workers’ freedom to join together in unions can be a powerful force for social inclusion in the workplace, advancing both racial and economic equity by enabling working people of all races to get a fair share of the wealth they create.  This is exactly why greedy corporate interests have consistently manipulated racism to turn working people against each other, pushing down wages, undermining solidarity, and weakening the freedom to stand together in unions. One recent example is the push by corporate lobbyists to enact federal and state-level policies deceptively named “Right to Work” laws. These laws, like the one voters in Missouri rejected on August 7th, undermine workers’ ability to form strong unions by draining collective resources. In a recent brief about “Right to Work” I explored the policy’s racist origins:
The Depression years of the 1930s saw a dramatic upsurge in union organizing, formalized by the passage of the National Labor Relations Act in 1935. Threatened by workers’ mobilizations, an oil industry lobbyist named Vance Muse promoted the term “right to work” in 1936 to describe restrictions on union activity. An associate of the Ku Klux Klan, Muse saw unionization not only as a threat to employers’ high rate of profitability but also to the white supremacist order of the Jim Crow South. As labor organizers sought to bring working people together across racial lines, Muse warned that without “right to work” legislation to impede union organizing, “white women and white men will be forced into organizations with black African apes whom they will have to call ‘brother’ or lose their jobs.” Preying on the ugliest racial enmity, Muse’s organization advanced “right to work” aggressively in the segregated South, with Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia among the first states to adopt the anti-worker laws.
With their ability to form strong unions hobbled, it’s not surprising that working people in states with “Right to Work” laws are paid lower wages and fewer benefits, on average, than comparable workers in other states. Research from Valerie Wilson and Julia Wolfe at the Economic Policy Institute finds that  white workers make 15.1 percent less per hour in states with “right to work” laws compared to white workers in states with fewer restrictions on the freedom to form strong unions. In other words, succumbing to the racism peddled by Muse and his ilk directly suppressed the pay of white workers (in some cases, for generations). While the authors note that anti-union laws are not solely responsible for these wage differences, they are a clear factor pulling down workers’ pay.
The examples of minimum wage fights and the struggle over “Right to Work” yield the same conclusion: social exclusion of people of color in the workplace ultimately benefits wealthy and powerful corporate employers, to the detriment of black, brown, and white workers alike.",blog
"“American workers should have paid sick leave,” announced the New York Times in a staff editorial on Sunday, “and New York City could set a standard for the rest of the nation.” With that, the nation’s newspaper of record waded into the long fight for what most Americans already say is a basic workplace right: the chance to recuperate from sickness without losing a day’s pay -- or worse yet, getting fired from your job.
July 18, 2012 New York women rally for paid sick days on the steps of City Hall
Those of us who have paid sick leave tend to take it for granted. Yet 40 million Americans, including two out of three low-wage workers in the U.S. -- the employees who can least afford to miss a paycheck -- do not have a single paid sick day to recover from illness or take care of sick child or relative. These workers must choose between losing a day’s pay or coming to work sick, endangering their own health and the public. Many low-wage workers even risk losing their jobs and health coverage if they call in sick. According to a University of Chicago survey, one in six Americans says that they or a family member have been fired, suspended, punished, or threatened by an employer for missing work due to illness.  The result is a more fearful and precarious low-wage labor force, just one illness away from slipping into poverty.
The solution is simple: at least 145 countries around the world provide employees with some guarantee of paid sick days for short or long-term illnesses. But while states and cities from Connecticut to Seattle and San Francisco to the District of Columbia have acted in recent years to secure a few days off for sick workers, the United States as a whole offers no such guarantee. The New York Times is right to observe that “the best way to address this workplace and public health problem is with a national law requiring businesses to provide paid sick leave.” But they are also correct that the Washington status quo makes progress unlikely in the near future. That’s where New York City comes in.
As a highly successful 2006 law in San Francisco has demonstrated, paid sick time can work at the municipal level.  That’s why ever since, a broad coalition of New Yorkers have been working for a paid sick time standard in New York City. Research has found that paid sick time in New York would not harm the economy or job growth, and would in fact save on health care costs, and benefit small businesses with less turnover and a more motivated workforce.  
The need and evidence of positive impact is so great that a veto-proof majority of 36 New York City council members support a proposed city law that already includes a number of compromises to accommodate business interests. Now the law faces just one roadblock: City Council Speaker Christine Quinn has refused to bring the legislation to a vote.
The pressure is on. Thousands of New Yorkers have signed a petition appealing to Quinn to stop blocking the Paid Sick Time Act. And the Speaker is now engaged in what Demos fellow Sharon Lerner  has called “a feminist showdown,” a public face-off between Quinn, who hopes to become New York’s first female mayor, and feminist icon Gloria Steinem, who, along with some 200 other powerful women in politics, has called on Quinn to bring the bill to a vote. Steinem has announced that her support for Quinn –whom she personally introduced at a major fund-raiser last fall – is contingent upon Quinn’s support for paid sick days legislation.
New York has the chance to be a progressive leader, providing a critical benefit to 1.5 million working people who can’t afford to get sick, and helping to propel the entire nation in the right direction. Let’s get it right.",blog
"One of the major companies responsible for the nation’s credit meltdown will now control your personal credit history. Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, the private equity wing of the financial firm, has partnered with another private equity company to buy the credit reporting firm TransUnion. Collecting and reselling personal information about your borrowing and bill-paying behavior is apparently worth more than $3 billion.
For those at the top, it’s a sweet deal: one former TransUnion owner will see a 50 percent increase in return on its investment in the company after owning it for less than two years. Private equity funds selling to other private equity funds is a lucrative business.
But for consumers, the deal promises few benefits. Consider the problem of credit reporting errors:  private equity companies buy firms for their potential to generate profit, and credit reporting companies like TransUnion earn the lion’s share of their profits from creditors rather than consumers— thus they have little financial incentive to conduct meaningful investigations when consumers find an error in their credit report. Instead, they rely on cheap automated dispute-resolution processes to resolve them. Nothing changes there, unless private equity pressures to keep costs down squeeze the dispute resolution process at TransUnion still more.
And the sale makes TransUnion no more likely to respond to a petition urging it to cease selling credit reports to employers on the grounds that they are unreliable and discriminatory in an employment context. Since when has Goldman Sachs listened to the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights or the National Council of La Raza?
This is a great time to have the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on the job. In August, Demos submitted comments urging the CFPB to supervise the nation’s powerful credit reporting agencies,  including TransUnion, Equifax, Experian and smaller entities that gather personal credit information about consumers and profit by selling it to lenders, insurance companies, and employers. This month the CFPB responded to the concerns raised by Demos and others, recognizing that “the consumer reporting market plays a critical role in the consumer financial services marketplace and in consumers’ financial lives” and issuing a proposed rule saying that the largest credit reporting agencies would fall under its highest level of scrutiny. That’s a power that even Goldman Sachs may have to listen to.",blog
"Without your consent, approval, or even awareness, large for-profit credit reporting companies know an awful lot about you. TransUnion, Experian, Equifax and their smaller competitors know the credit limit on your AmEx card, how much you still owe in student loans, and all about that time you made the car payment late. Now, for a change, we may get to learn a bit more about them. 
This week, the year-old Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) announced that it will become the first federal entity to exercise supervisory power over credit reporting companies, meaning that it can compel the credit reporting companies to open their books and their internal policies and procedures to examination. The CFPB will be able to assess the companies’ compliance with consumer protection laws and evaluate any additional risks to consumers, potentially drafting new regulations if risks are detected.
The decision has the potential to benefit millions of Americans, given that the three largest credit reporting companies alone each maintain files on more than 200 million people in the U.S., a reason why Demos submitted comments strongly supporting the CFPB’s supervision of Credit Reporting Agencies.   And not only is the impact broad, but it's deep as well. As we noted in, “Discrediting America,” our recent paper on credit reporting:
Credit reports and scores have a direct and growing impact on Americans’ economic security and opportunity. Having poor credit can mean a consumer will end up paying a higher interest rate for a loan or a higher premium for car or homeowner’s insurance; have their application for a loan or insurance denied; be turned down for a job, or even be terminated from their current one. Credit history can affect the way Americans are treated by landlords, utility companies, and hospitals.
In the report, we detailed several ways in which the credit reporting system falls short on basic goals of fairness and accuracy. Chief among them was the prevalence of errors in credit reports and the fiendish difficulty getting disputes resolved and errors removed. Luckily, this is the area where consumer advocates see the most potential for the CFPB’s supervision to make a difference, improving accuracy and enhancing dispute resolution processes.
For their part, the credit reporting companies have tried to play it cool. Gerry Tschopp, a spokesman for Experian, told the Associated Press that “the government already oversees the industry, because the Federal Trade Commission has been responsible for enforcing the Fair Credit Reporting Act since it became law in 1970.” But the FTC had more limited and reactive authority over credit bureaus, being empowered only to enforce breaches of the law after they occurred. When it goes into effect on September 30, the CFPB’s authority will be broader and more proactive, capable of probing the hidden recesses of the companies that already know so much about our own private financial details. Or, as Ed Mierzwinski at USPIRG writes, “the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act establishing the CFPB gave it guns that the FTC has never had.”
Although I’m typically not a fan of violent metaphors, when it comes to secretive companies with a tremendous impact on our economic lives, consumers need the biggest guns we can get. Thanks to the CFPB and the Dodd Frank Act for arming us.",blog
"“My client only wants to look at employed candidates,”  said one recruiter. “The company. . . will not interview any professional not presently working,” said another. “Candidate MUST be currently employed . . .  ""employed or only recently unemployed. . ."" ""require current (or very recent) tenure,” read 150 help wanted ads enumerated by the National Employment Law Project (NELP) as part of a four-week survey. All of this adds up to very bad news for the millions of Americans looking for work who lack one qualification suddenly deemed crucial: a current job.   
If it takes a job to get a job, what are the unemployed -- and especially those inhabiting the still swollen ranks of long-term unemployed -- supposed to do? In New York City, this is one barrier to employment that may soon be toppled. Yesterday the City Council passed legislation prohibiting discrimination based on an individual’s unemployment status. 
Under the bill, job postings with language excluding the unemployed will be banned, and unemployed workers can no longer be arbitrarily excluded from consideration for a job. Significantly, the legislation also directs the city’s Commission on Human Rights to educate employers, employment agencies and job seekers about the new law so that its provisions will not go overlooked or unnoticed. While Mayor Bloomberg has said he will veto the legislation, the Council has sufficient votes to override it.
If enacted, the law will be a boon for more than 300,000 out-of-work New Yorkers. According to the Fiscal Policy Institute, the average length of unemployment in New York City is 41.9 weeks --approximately 10.5 months. But the burden of joblessness does not hit all of the city’s communities equally: African Americans and Latinos experience much higher rates of unemployment in New York City and the nation as a whole, and  the average length of time out of work is longer for African Americans. In effect, hiring discrimination against the unemployed compounds racial discrimination in hiring -- meaning that the bill is also an important civil rights measure.
When America’s largest city takes action, the nation takes notice. The legislation sends a powerful message to employers and staffing firms across the country that discrimination against the unemployed is intolerable. At the same time, it lays the groundwork for New York City itself to move forward on legislation removing another illegitimate barrier to employment: the use of credit checks in hiring. Intro 857,  prohibiting discrimination based on one's consumer credit history, was introduced in May 2012 and is still awaiting a hearing. It too has a veto-proof majority of co-sponsors. Having taken one important step toward ending employment discrimination, New York City is well-positioned to take the next.",blog
"The news broke last night: a deal to bring paid sick days to a vote in the New York City Council has been reached. 
As I noted in my recent testimony on the bill, paid sick time is far from a pie-in-the-sky idea. It is the law in 145 countries around the world as well as the state of Connecticut, and the cities of San Francisco, Washington D.C., Seattle, and Portland, Oregon. Based on how this policy has operated in practice, the evidence strongly suggests that this is a successful policy and that it does not harm employment or the growth of small businesses as opponents have argued. The majority of New Yorkers—and indeed the majority of Americans—believe that one shouldn't lose a day's pay (or their job itself) just because they get sick. Every working person should be guaranteed at least a few paid days off a year for illness.
My case was based on careful studies from McGill University, the Urban Institute, the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, the Community Service Society of New York, the Center for Economic and Policy Research, and the Drum Major Institute for Public Policy. But in the end, the facts weren’t what mattered.
What mattered was, as the New York Times wrote “a raw display of political muscle by a coalition of labor unions and liberal activists who overcame fierce objections from New York’s business-minded mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, and his allies in the corporate world.”
In other words, this is a municipal election year, the City Council Speaker who had previously blocked a vote is now running for mayor and saw the issue forced onto the political agenda as the result of years of tireless organizing and advocacy, and she is now reportedly letting a much-weakened bill to the floor for a democratic vote by the City Council. As the result of repeated compromises, Public Advocate Bill DeBlasio (himself a mayoral candidate with an interest in minimizing his opponent’s achievement) points out that thousands of New York workers will still lack sick leave even after the law is in place.
Let’s consider what it took to get to this point. Many media accounts observe that the bill has been before the Council for three years—yet I started working on the issue five years ago, when I helped to bring Sarah Flocks of Young Workers United,  a key grassroots group that helped to win paid sick days in San Francisco, to New York to speak about her success. At that point bill sponsor Gail Brewer and local organizations like A Better Balance and the New York Paid Leave Coalition  had already been working to bring paid sick days to New York City for years. It took the prospect of a major, potentially realigning city election to bring a policy supported from the start by a majority of New Yorkers (and a strong majority of City Council members) to the floor for a vote.
The battle over paid sick days in New York illustrates both the accomplishments and the limits of our troubled democracy: despite fierce opposition from wealthy and powerful business interests, policies that primarily benefit the less empowered segments of our society—disproportionately female, low-wage workers of color who lack even a single paid day off work to care of themselves or a sick loved one—can nevertheless become law. So democracy works and elections do promote accountability! And yet, it should not have taken so long or required so many compromises on the basic principal—everybody gets sick, so every working person should have the opportunity to earn at least a few paid sick days a year—to make this popular, proven policy a reality.
To extend the metaphor of Demos’ recent paper on the dominance of politics by business: the game is not entirely rigged. We can—and did—win a round in the paid sick days fight. But the fact that the deck is stacked against us makes even our victories harder to win and more partial than they should be.",blog
"Today the U.S. House of Representatives voted to gut financial reform. Members of Congress wrapped up their vote in high-flying language about “choice,” “freedom,” and “jobs,” but there was no hiding the underlying substance: razing the financial reforms enacted to prevent a recurrence of the 2008 financial crisis and uprooting the successful Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).
What’s at stake in the fight over the CHOICE Act? This video tells part of the story:

As the video makes clear, the CFPB offers critical consumer protection to all Americans. Yet some communities are particularly vulnerable to financial abuses—and more in need of strong consumer protection from the CFPB.
From deceptively-marketed, high-interest mortgages to payday loans that trap borrowers in a cycle of debt to harassment from bill collectors,  communities of color are consistent targets of discrimination and predatory behavior. The vast and growing racial wealth gap that leaves the median black household with only 6 percent of the wealth owned by the median white household (while the median Latinx household holds only 8 percent of the wealth held by white households) means that black and Latinx families have less wealth to draw on in the event of financial shocks like job loss, an emergency car repair, or an unexpected medical bill. The lack of a financial cushion increases families’ vulnerability to predatory lending, making strong consumer protections especially important.
The upshot? When Congress acts to undermine the CFPB’s power and effectiveness, it is communities of color that are hit hardest.  
As Demos noted in our statement on the bill, the Financial CHOICE Act amounts to little more than a lavish giveaway to campaign donors on Wall Street at the expense of American consumers and the overall stability of the nation’s financial system. It’s a leading example of how our nation’s public policies are skewed towards the interests of top donors—including the financial interests that poured $1.2 billion into elections during the last campaign cycle—and away from working families and people of color as a whole. Members of Congress who voted for the bill have revealed where they stand.
The Financial CHOICE Act is expected to die in the Senate, as it should. But there is still danger that harmful provisions weakening the CFPB and undermining financial reform could be inserted into other legislation and enacted into law. Consumers—and anyone standing up for their interests—must be vigilant. ",blog
"You can explain the current plight of the American middle class in three sentences. Timothy Egan did in the New York Times this week:
This is how the middle class dies, not with a bang, but a forced squeeze. After a global corporation posts record profits, it asks the state that has long nurtured its growth for the nation’s biggest single tax break, and then tells the people who make its products that their pension plan will be frozen, their benefits slashed, their pay raises meager. Take it or we leave.
Egan goes on to describe how the State of Washington leapt to approve a record $8.7 billion in tax breaks to keep Boeing in the Seattle area. But when it came to job concessions that would dramatically downgrade the jobs of Boeing’s highly skilled manufacturing workforce, the Machinists Union overwhelmingly voted no. Egan compares the workers’ resistance to “the Alamo, Custer’s Last Stand, Braveheart” – a valiant but almost certainly doomed attempt to stand up for their own middle-class American jobs.
The highly profitable company could easily afford to offer its workforce a much better deal, but it also had the power not to. Companies like Boeing, which could step up and assert that they will keep faith with the region that nurtured them and the unionized workforce that has brought them tremendous profitability, are instead aggressively pursuing the race to the bottom. Political leaders are similarly turning their backs on the middle class.
Egan sees the Boeing story as illustrative of “the utter bankruptcy of economic policy prescriptions offered by both political parties.” Republicans offered mammoth tax breaks and deregulation, while Democrats served up an educated and skilled workforce, with public investment in training to suit Boeing’s personnel needs. None of it was enough. The company had the leverage to demand that middle-class jobs be devalued, so it did.
But surely policy doesn’t always need to crumple in the face of corporate power. The public, too, can make a demand. For a major federal contractor like Boeing, action could be taken at the executive level.  As my colleague Robert Hiltonsmith and I noted in a recent Demos study: “through the use of his executive power, President Obama has the authority to call for improvements in workplace standards among companies that do business with the federal government or get special benefits from federal agencies.” While our research focused on the potential to raise standards for the lowest paid federal contract workers, it is also worth exploring how job quality could be preserved for contract workers with high quality jobs they are in danger of losing.
At the same time, Congress could act to make it more difficult for companies to downgrade jobs, or strengthen the ability of working people to push back through their unions. If it was easier for unions to organize throughout the United States, for example, the lure of moving production to a factory in Texas or South Carolina would be dramatically reduced. And today yet we see a political push in precisely the opposite direction, with politicians fighting workers’ efforts to organize manufacturing in the American South even when the employer does not object. The effort is just one manifestation of a broader state-level “series of initiatives aimed at lowering labor standards, weakening unions, and eroding workplace protections for both union and non-union workers” documented by Gordon Lafer in a recent Economic Policy Institute report.
Leaving aside domestic policy, there are also policy options that would reduce a corporation’s power to blithely move jobs internationally in a global race to the bottom: if our trade deal were written to provide more power to workers’ organizations around the world, they could become a more effective tool for building the middle class globally. Instead, proposed trade deals, like the highly-secretive Trans Pacific Partnership, will move us aggressively in the direction of lower wages and fewer rights for working people (and more power for companies like Boeing).
A different set of policy decisions is possible. Yet, today’s political reality is even  worse than Timothy Egan envisions: not only are the political “solutions” being implemented inadequate to save middle-class jobs, but many political leaders are actively working to undermine the ability of working people to earn a decent wage.",blog
"As Black Friday approaches, retailers nationwide are waiting anxiously to see whether the nation’s busiest shopping day will deliver a boost in profits. But perhaps no company has more at stake than Walmart, the shopping behemoth that was the world’s largest retailer until Amazon supplanted it in that role this summer.
Months after announcing a $1 billion investment in raising wages  for its lowest-paid U.S. workers, Walmart slashed its annual sales forecast and saw its stock values plunge. Now Walmart faces more pressure than ever to perform for investors who want short-term results. But Walmart should keep its eye on long-term gains.",media
"We probably don’t need to be reminded that the economy is a critical problem. Yet the nation’s political conversation still founders on the question of what it is about the nation’s economic performance that is holding back the middle class and people trying to work their way into it. Into the fray steps the Economic Policy Institute, with straight-forward, clarifying data in a new study that should help to focus the political debate.
In reality it’s not budget deficits or economic uncertainty or a lack of innovation and productivity advances that are slowing our economic recovery and undermining the middle class. It’s the stagnant wages. EPI economists Lawrence Mishel and Heidi Shierholz offer this summary:
If the numbers are making your eyes glaze over, think about this way: “the vast majority of wage earners have already experienced a lost decade, one where real wages were either flat or in decline.” And that lost decade itself was hardly following on a golden age of broad prosperity. Instead:
This lost decade for wages comes on the heels of decades of inadequate wage growth. For virtually the entire period since 1979 (with the one exception being the strong wage growth of the late 1990s), wage growth for most workers has been weak. The median worker saw an increase of just 5.0 percent between 1979 and 2012, despite productivity growth of 74.5 percent—while the 20th percentile worker saw wage erosion of 0.4 percent and the 80th percentile worker saw wage growth of just 17.5 percent.
Focusing on stagnant wages as a primary obstacle to growing the nation’s middle class enables us to think clearly about the policy choices that contributed to a lost decade for wages as well as the policy decisions that could reverse the trend. Rather than austerity, we need “large-scale ongoing public investments and the reestablishment of state and local public services that were cut in the Great Recession and its aftermath” in order to lower unemployment so that wages can rise.
We also need to raise the minimum wage and take other steps to give low- and middle-wage workers more power in the workplace – including labor law reform, immigration reform that empowers working people, and “taking executive action to ensure that federal dollars are not spent employing people in jobs with poverty-level wages.”  [Policy suggestions in the preceding paragraphs were included in the EPI study, links are my own]
In addition to EPI’s analysis, I would add that we need to be thinking about the recent strikes of Walmart employees, fast food workers, and other Americans earning low wages for hard work in the context of stagnant wages. As my colleague Catherine Ruetschlin pointed out, the $15 an hour fast food strikers are calling for sounds like a far less radical demand when you remember that the minimum wage would be $21.72 an hour if it had kept pace with productivity increases since 1968.
Wage stagnation for low- and middle-income workers is holding the entire economy back. The time to focus and take action is past due.",blog
"This week, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) turns 6 years old. In an op-ed on Univision.com, my colleague Vijay Das and I consider the vital ways the agency stands up for the interests of American consumers, even as its independence and authority are continually under fire from financial services lobbyists and their congressional allies. As we note, the CFPB’s work has been especially critical to communities of color, which are disproportionately targeted for predatory financial services, from the deceptive, high-interest mortgages  that caused the last financial crisis to payday loans, fee-laden prepaid cards, and much more.
Predatory lenders both exploit the existing racial wealth gap and fuel its growth by stripping more wealth from communities of color.
In research I conducted with scholars at the Institute on Assets and Social Policy at Brandeis University, we find that the median white household possessed $13 in net wealth for every dollar held by the median black household in 2013. That same year, the median white household possessed $10 for each dollar held by the median Latino/a household. As we note, these wealth disparities are rooted in historic injustices, but are carried forward today by practices and policies that fail to reverse inequitable trends and may even deepen them. The policy decision to weaken financial protections and give financial services companies free rein to cheat consumers is a sure-fire way to deepen the wealth gap.
One reason the wealth gap makes communities of color more vulnerable to predatory financial services is because households with less wealth have little or no financial cushion to fall back on in the event of a financial shock. If a breadwinner suddenly loses her job, the car needs an expensive repair, or a medical emergency produces surprise bills, a family living paycheck-to-paycheck will have few good options. They may turn to a predatory financial product, like a payday loan or car title scam. Or the family may fall behind on bills and develop increasingly flawed credit as they struggle to keep up. With a poor credit history, high-interest financial products may be the only ones a household qualifies for. Poor credit can also lock job seekers out of the very employment opportunities they need to get back on their feet financially. And with unpaid bills, the household must also contend with the abusive practices of debt collectors. 
To be clear, low-income, low-wealth families of all races and ethnicities find themselves in this position, but the racial wealth gap, and the persistence of employment discrimination and occupational segregation, mean that households of color are disproportionately likely to be trapped in a cycle of growing debt and worsening credit. Evidence suggests that there remains plenty of overt racial and ethnic discrimination in lending, but as long as shady lenders and debt collectors are free to prey on disadvantaged households, under-regulated lending will deepen the racial wealth gap even without intentional bias.    
Enter the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. By regulating financial practices and cracking down on violators, the agency is creating a more fair financial marketplace for all of us—good news for anyone who wants to cash a check, have a bank account, get a credit card, buy a car, go to college, save for retirement, send money to relatives abroad or simply stop a debt collector from harassing you about a bill you never owed. By preventing practices that disproportionately extract wealth from communities of color, the CFPB also slows the growth of the racial wealth gap. Efforts to weaken and undermine the power and independence of the CFPB are precisely the type of ostensibly race-neutral policy decisions that have deepened racial disparities in the past. We cannot allow it to happen again. ",blog
"States used to have the authority to enforce usury laws, capping the excessive interest rates of any lender interested in transacting business with their citizens. Although usury laws are still on the books in some states across the country, when it comes to credit cards they are rendered useless by deregulation of the industry.
Credit card deregulation began in 1978 with Marquette National Bank of Minneapolis v. First Omaha Service Corp. and continued with Smiley v. Citibank in 1996. Taken together, the two Supreme Court rulings allowed national banks to charge credit card customers the highest interest rate permitted in the bank’s home state, with fees defined as interest for the purposes of regulation. As a result, national banks physically moved their credit card operations to states, such as South Dakota and Delaware that have no usury limits. As a result, many consumers now face interest rates as high as 30 percent or more.
Demos research finds that four in ten low-and middle-income households carrying credit card debt use their credit cards to pay for basic living expenses such as rent or mortgage bills, groceries, utilities, or insurance, in the past year because they did not have enough money in their checking or savings accounts. For these households, who are financing an average credit card debt load of $7,145, high interest rates are a costly burden.
We’re on record calling for a national usury limit to contain the interest rates on credit cards and other loans. But Senators Sheldon Whitehouse and Elizabeth Warren recently proposed another idea worth considering: enabling states to once again protect their own citizens from excessive credit card interest rates.
According to the sponsors,  the Empowering States' Rights to Protect Consumers Act, “would amend the Truth in Lending Act of 1968 to clarify that all consumer lenders-regardless of their location or legal structure-must abide by the interest rate limits of the states in which their customers reside.”
The idea is simple and should, in theory, appeal to the most ardent supporter of states’ rights. The downside is that while Senator Whitehouse’s home state of Rhode Island and Senator Warren’s home state of Massachusetts might well act in the public interest to curb credit card interest rates, other states would likely continue to provide the banks issuing credit cards with free rein, as some states currently do with much higher interest payday lending.",blog
"Today is a key date in the struggle for economic equality and human rights. November 1st is Latina Equal Pay Day, marking the date when the typical Latina woman’s wages since January 1, 2017 finally catch up to what the typical white man was paid in calendar year 2017.  The date is calculated based on Census Bureau data on full-time, full-year workers who identified as female and Hispanic or Latino. Latinx workers are overrepresented in industries notorious for both low pay and sexual assault, including janitorial work on the night shift, agricultural work, and hotel services. This disparity in workplace safety, compared to white men, is an inherently unequal working condition, distinct from wage disparity alone.
Many factors contribute to the Latina pay gap, including pervasive workplace discrimination, lack of educational opportunities, and—in the case of Latina immigrants—barriers posed by immigrant status and language proficiency. Sexual harassment and violence are other factors that both cause and exacerbate the economic disparity between Latinx workers who identify as women and white men. The costs of workplace sexual harassment and outright violence exacerbate the ill effects of earning a wage that is half of what it should be—including costs for treatment of physical injuries, cost of treating associated emotional injuries, risk of workplace retaliation for reporting or objecting to harassment, and social stigma.
Latinx confront the combined effects of ethnic, racial, and gender bias that can produce demeaning stereotypes about their sexual receptiveness and compound the risk of being harassed. At the same time, Latinx are concentrated in service-sector jobs where workers are more exposed to both low pay and harassment. These jobs often involve extreme power imbalances with supervisors and a need to appear pleasant and accommodating to customers, further increasing workers’ vulnerability to harassment and fear of reprisals that can discourage victims from coming forward.
Sexual harassment can impact Latinx pay by pushing workers out of jobs or entire industries, often into lower-paying work. According to a study of young women from diverse backgrounds, those who experienced harassment at work were 6.5 times more likely to change jobs than those who did not face harassment, and they continued to report significantly greater financial stress two years later.
Yet a powerful Latinx movement is pushing back: Dignity for Latinx bodies is a fundamental part of equal pay for equal work. Worker-led coalitions are creating safer workplaces and curtailing wage theft in Latinx-heavy industries.
Latinx workers and their allies are responding to disparities in both pay and dignity with intersectional interventions. For example, in California’s janitorial services industry, the Ya Basta! Coalition is creating an infrastructure of prometoras, janitorial peer advocates who empower and support their colleagues against perpetrators of sexual violence who are exploiting low-wage workers’ isolated working conditions, limited English proficiency, ignorance of anti-sexual violence laws, fear of immigration enforcement, and/or fear of retaliation for reporting assaults. 
California’s Property Service Workers Protection Act was a critical policy victory for the Ya Basta! Coalition. It established state-wide safeguards against wage theft and strengthened sexual harassment training requirements in the janitorial industry. Jennifer Reisch, Legal Director of Equal Rights Advocates, a member of the Ya Basta! Coalition, described how Latinx workers are continuing to “take their power” with the promertora program, undeterred by Governor Brown’s veto of a further anti-sexual harassment bill earlier this month. The coalition of anti-violence advocates, union leaders, worker advocates, and women worker leaders is permanently disrupting insidious power structures with relentless organizing.
Measure Z in Oakland California is another example of regulation with the potential to reduce both the wage gap and the dignity gap for large numbers of Latinx workers. The measure would provide Oakland hotel workers with better pay and industry-specific safeguards against sexual assault via help buttons in hotel rooms. Cynthia Morfin, Oakland Organizer for EBASE, is a Latinx leader in the Measure Z campaign as well as a former hotel worker herself. “We see sexual assault and the overworking and underpaying of immigrant women hotel workers as two parts of the same story: hotel companies putting their profits over peoples' humanity. This is obviously an abuse of their power, and it’s up to us to demand dignity and respect in the workplace,” Morfin commented.",blog
"Like many New Yorkers, Hazel B. of Queens struggled to get by after she was laid off from her job as an accounts receivable administrator. A single mother of two, Hazel relied on credit cards to make ends meet while she looked for work.
Finally, she found a job opening that looked promising. She went on two interviews and took a test given by the potential employer. She believed she had performed well, but then word came back that Hazel would not be hired because of negative information in her credit report.
The debts she ran up while unemployed would now prevent her from getting a job.
Hazel’s plight is disturbingly common. Whether they’re looking for a job walking dogs or trading bonds on Wall Street, New Yorkers from all walks of life are finding their path to employment blocked by their credit history. With more than 360,000 city residents out of work, credit checks have become a barrier to employment that no one can afford.
Today, the City Council holds a hearing on the Stop Credit Discrimination in Employment Act, sponsored by Council member Brad Lander, which would help ensure that all job-seekers have a fair shot at gainful work.
Credit reports were never developed for hiring in the first place; these records of an individual’s borrowing history were intended for lenders to make decisions about how likely someone is to pay back a loan. But when companies selling credit information saw a new customer base for their product, they began marketing reports to employers — even though credit checks have never been proven reliable for hiring.
As a spokesman for credit reporting behemoth TransUnion acknowledged, “At this point, we don’t have any research to show any statistical correlation between what’s in somebody’s credit report and their job performance or their likelihood to commit fraud.”",media
"The New York Times editorial was unequivocal: “the [New York City] Council and Mayor Bill de Blasio should unite behind this worthwhile bill” to ban the discriminatory practice of employment credit checks. After all, as the Times pointed out, “The worst of the recession is behind us, but the damage lives on for millions of Americans who are hobbled by bad credit… Does membership in the club of beleaguered borrowers inevitably make someone a risky hire or an unreliable employee? Hardly. Does it justify the increasingly common practice of employers using credit checks to reject prospective hires? No.”
Therefore: support the bill, and don’t weaken it by adding exceptions and loopholes as other states have done.
But if it were that easy, New York would have passed the law long ago. Instead, opposition to the legislation has surfaced from the corporate lobby. In response to the Times editorial, Kathryn Wylde, leader of the city’s most powerful business group, penned a letter to the editor acknowledging “prejudice that can disadvantage certain job seekers” but insisting that the exemptions that have undermined so many state laws ought to be added in New York City as well. Yet Wylde’s case doesn’t stand up to scrutiny
First, Wylde asks readers to consider “the growing threats of identity theft and cyber-fraud that make background checks for certain highly sensitive positions more necessary than ever.” She is correct that identity theft is relevant to the debate over employment credit checks, but not for the reason mentioned: in fact, identity theft is one reason why the credit reports employers use to check credit history so often contain incorrect information, frequently without the job applicant even being aware of the problem. The growth of identity theft makes credit reports even more unreliable for employers than they would otherwise be. The notorious difficulty correcting the errors and misrepresentations caused by identity theft make the problem still more severe.
Yet the argument that fraud and other forms of employee misconduct make credit checks advisable is flawed for another reason. As I’ve pointed out before, it is rooted in the mistaken premise that reviewing a job applicant's personal credit report can predict whether someone is likely to steal. Yet despite the prevalence of employment credit checks, no research has ever shown that reviewing job applicants’ credit history successfully produces a more honest or reliable workforce that is less likely to engage in crimes like identity theft or cyber-fraud. Instead, conducting credit checks to screen new hires may produce a false sense of security of security for employers.
Wylde calls for city lawmakers to adopt “the common-sense exemptions for jobs that could expose consumers and employers to particular risks.” I explored each of these exemptions, none of which are grounded in empirical facts or research, in a recent open memo to policymakers. Read it here.
Wyde notes that “use of credit checks is… regulated at the federal level.” The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act does indeed regulate the use of credit checks—permitting them for employment purposes while also leaving room for state and local governments to enact their own stronger protections for employees and job seekers. That’s exactly what New York City commendably aims to do.
Finally, consider Wylde’s point that credit checks are “highly targeted” and that “standard employer practice is to conduct checks only for sensitive positions.” What might these “sensitive positions” be? A quick look at recent New York City job listings on Craigslist shows credit checks are a requirement for jobs such as washing dishes and mopping floors at a restaurant, working as a home health aide, or office assistant, and being employed as a personal driver or computer operator. Major national retailers such as Victoria’s Secret and Home Depot regularly run credit checks when hiring for entry level sales associates. All of these positions may appear “sensitive” to employers convinced that someone with good credit will be less likely to steal, but given that checking credit has not been shown to reduce employee misconduct, the breadth of positions simply illustrates why so many state laws have been completed gutted by loopholes and exemptions.
Credit reports can have a discriminatory impact on people of color, people with disabilities, and survivors of domestic abuse and set up new barriers to employment for New Yorkers who are out of work. None of the points marshalled by Kathryn Wylde, or the lobbist for the credit reporting industry group who commented on my Huffington Post article, offer convincing arguments or evidence to the contrary. 
The truth is, credit reports—a tool originally developed for lenders determining who to lend to and on what terms—have no relevance for hiring or employment.",blog
"“I’m trying to think of another industry where a 20 percent error rate would be acceptable.” says 60 Minutes correspondent Steve Kroft, in a new exposé of the credit reporting industry. “That’s a pretty high error rate.”
To say the least.
Kroft was discussing the findings of a comprehensive new study by the Federal Trade Commission, which finds that 21 percent of consumers had a material error on a credit report from one of three major credit reporting companies. While not all of these errors would affect consumer borrowing, the research suggests that as many as 10 million Americans (5 percent of consumers with credit reports) have errors in their credit reports so serious that they would likely pay more for auto loans or other credit -- or would be shut out of credit opportunities entirely. That’s a troubling statistic for borrowers, especially given the tremendous difficulty consumers face in getting errors in credit reports resolved.  But the problem with credit reporting errors may be much greater than the numbers suggest.
Regular readers of this blog are familiar with another common use of credit reports: employment screening. As I’ve noted before, about half of employers say they now examine the personal credit history of job applicants when hiring. But unlike lending scenarios where it’s relatively straightforward how much an error damages a consumer’s ability to access credit, the impact of errors on employment prospects are much harder to measure.
The reason? What employers look for in a credit report – and how much they weigh different factors like late bills, foreclosures, or accounts in collection – is completely arbitrary. Employers do not have access to credit scores, but rather written reports listing credit accounts and their status. For one employer on one day, a single late bill could be interpreted as a sign that a job applicant lacks responsibility and can’t be trusted at a cash register. Another employer could look at multiple bills in collection and be reminded of their own difficulty coping with uninsured hospital expenses when their child needed an emergency operation. A credit reporting mistake that is too small to make a difference in applying for credit might nevertheless stand out to an employer – and cost someone a job. As a result, it’s nearly impossible to say how errors on credit reports may impact someone’s employment prospects.
Since nothing on a consumer’s credit report has been proven to predict an employee’s job performance or propensity to steal from an employer or customer, any interpretation an employer makes is entirely subjective. That’s one reason why credit reports are not reliable for employment. And one reason why it’s critical that this week Representative Steve Cohen will reintroduce legislation restricting the use of credit checks for employment purposes nationwide. Cohen’s legislation, known as the Equal Employment for All Act, has garnered the support of dozens of civil rights, consumer, labor and community groups.
In an editorial today, the New York Times suggests additional remedies for addressing credit reporting errors:
[Congress] could require all credit or background check agencies to register with the federal government and to adhere to strict accuracy standards. It could give consumers the right to view all credit information that agencies collect about them.  Finally, it could strengthen an existing law that requires that consumers receive notice when they are denied jobs, credit or are in any way disadvantaged by unfavorable credit report information. Sometimes such notices are never sent; Congress should give the consumers the right to sue when this happens.
These are solid recommendations, and they echo suggestions issued by Demos and other consumer experts. But when it comes to employment, accurate and well-disclosed credit reports are not enough. Since personal credit history has no proven relevance to employment, employers and employees would be best served by a complete ban on employment credit checks.",blog
"The home mortgage crisis and Great Recession destroyed a generation of economic progress for African-American families. Now, reports the Washington Post, the discriminatory impact of credit scores and reports could cement the disadvantages into place for decades to come.
To be clear, there’s little evidence that race is an explicit factor used by for-profit companies like Experian, TransUnion and Equifax in calculating credit scores or reporting credit history. But by reporting payment data on loans resulting from predatory lending and other discriminatory factors and making it the basis for future economic decisions – from future lending for home buying or college to insurance rates and job opportunities – credit scores and reports perpetuate and amplify racial disparities, making it harder to ever get ahead.  
 And what disparities they are: from 2005 to 2009, the median wealth of America’s white households fell 16%, while black households saw an astounding 53% plunge, according to the Pew Research Center.  The result is an unprecedented racial wealth gap, with the median wealth of white households totaling 20 times that of black households. Add to that an African American unemployment rate nearly twice that of white workers, and the prospects for recovery look distant even without the added burden of poor credit.
And yet, poor credit is yet another very real obstacle to African American households striving to attain or regain middle-class stability. The Washington Post’s report that black households tend to have worse credit echoes the findings of Demos’ own recent survey of credit card debt among low- and middle-income households, which discovered that while 62 percent of overall indebted households reported that their credit was “excellent” or “good” only 44 percent of African Americans described their credit in such positive terms. As a result of poor credit, African Americans were more likely to report paying a high APR on their credit reports and to be plagued by calls from bill collectors, settlements with credit card companies, evictions, and foreclosures. “In addition,” the Post reports, “foreclosures can dry up the wealth of entire communities by depressing home values.”
But notably absent from the dismal Post article is any hint of a policy remedy: an especially glaring deficiency for the paper serving the nation’s capital. It was a public policy choice to deregulate lending in the first place, permitting lenders to make the predatory loans that stripped black communities of their wealth. So what about policy to reverse the drain?
Congress and state legislatures could begin by banning the use of credit history for employment purposes, so that predatory lending targeting the African American community will – at minimum – not weigh on future employment prospects. Lawmakers could go on to require that certain-to-fail loans made by irresponsible lenders be scrubbed from the credit histories of their victims. Additional bankruptcy and fair lending reforms, detailed in Demos’ recent report The Plastic Safety Net, would enable hard hit African American households to recover more quickly. In terms of the broader economic picture, aggressive job creation measures aimed at the communities most impacted by unemployment would provide a much-needed boost to African American families. Efforts to stem the tide of massive public sector job loss would particular benefit African American workers who are more likely to be public employees.
“I don’t really think there is such a thing as catching up,” the Post quotes Chicagoan Ida Mae Whitley, whose credit was battered by a predatory mortgage loan and foreclosure, observing at the end of the article. Without powerful policy solutions, she may be right.",blog
"Discrimination has no place in New York City.
The City’s Human Rights Law is one of the strongest bodies of civil rights law in the nation, and the City Council and Mayor have taken bold action to update it to address emerging forms of discrimination. So it’s entirely appropriate that New York City is now poised to pass the nation’s strongest law prohibiting employment discrimination against job applicants and current employees based on their personal credit history. And while employment credit checks may look like a relatively new form of discrimination, their effect of disproportionately locking people of color, people with disabilities, and domestic violence survivors out of job opportunities is all too familiar.
At first glance, the prospects for New York City’s bill to stop credit discrimination in employment appear bright. The legislation, sponsored by Councilman Brad Lander, has 39 co-sponsors on the City Council plus the backing of Public Advocate Letitia James. Mayor de Blasio has announced that he supports the concept of the bill.
But the real question is whether this legislation will be enacted in its current, strong form or will – like so many state laws on employment credit checks – be watered down to enable discrimination to continue in a host of different contexts, despite the lack of evidence that reviewing personal credit history can ensure a more trustworthy or reliable workforce for any employer or position. Indeed, the de Blasio Administration has publicly stated that exemptions to weaken the law are under consideration. While it makes sense for lawmakers to consider the experience of other jurisdictions in restricting the use of credit history in employment, the truth is that the exemptions in other state laws are not justified by evidence demonstrating that credit checks are actually valid or useful, or that there is a legitimate reason to open up the exempted positions to the type of discrimination that credit checks invite. Drawing on my recent memo to city policymakers, let’s consider each of the common exemptions found in many state laws on employment credit checks:
Credit checks are not justified for employees handling cash or goods. A number of state laws include exemptions permitting credit checks for employees that handle cash or have access to valuable property. These exemptions are based on the mistaken premise that reviewing a job applicant’s personal credit report can predict whether someone is likely to steal. However, as a spokesperson for TransUnion, one of the major credit reporting companies, admitted to the Oregon State Legislature: “we don’t have any research to show any statistical correlation between what’s in somebody’s credit report and their job performance or their likelihood to commit fraud.” The financial crisis and the Great Recession caused millions of Americans to be laid off from their jobs, see their home values plummet to less than their mortgage debt, and find their savings and retirement accounts decimate—all of which can affect credit history. These are largely factors that are outside an individual’s control and have no reflection on someone’s “moral character” or their propensity to steal.
Credit checks are not justified for employees with access to financial information. The rationale for checking credit when hiring for positions with access to financial or other confidential information is the same as for employees who handle cash – a belief that poor credit can predict whether an employee will misuse information to steal or commit fraud. The credit reporting industry frequently cites the amount of money businesses lose to fraud annually to illustrate the seriousness of the problem. However, as discussed above, there is no evidence that reviewing credit reports is an effective tool to screen out fraud-prone employees.
Credit checks are not justified for management positions. Permitting credit checks for management or supervisory positions puts a ceiling on the advancement of people struggling to pay their bills, regardless of their qualifications. This is particularly troubling given racial disparities in credit quality. A persistent legacy of discriminatory lending, hiring, and housing policies has left people of color with worse credit, on average, than white households. In recent years, historic disparities have been compounded by predatory lending schemes that targeted low-income communities and communities of color, putting them at greater risk of foreclosure and default on loans, further damaging credit. By evaluating prospective employees based on credit, employment credit checks can further extend this injustice. Given the discriminatory impact of employment credit checks, creating exemptions for management or supervisory positions could statutorily create two tiers of job opportunity depending on race and class. In effect, exemptions that permit credit checks for managerial or supervisory positions would keep people who are struggling to pay their bills stuck on the bottom rungs of the job ladder, no matter how skilled they may be.
Credit checks are not justified for law enforcement positions. Despite a lack of evidence that reviewing personal credit history can reveal how responsible, honest, or reliable an applicant will be on the job, many police departments continue to conduct credit checks and reportedly disqualify candidates with poor credit. This is particularly dangerous because using a faulty screening tool such as credit history may provide a false sense of security to law enforcement agencies if they erroneously believe a credit check will help to prevent them from hiring dishonest officers vulnerable to corruption. In addition, racial disparities in credit quality mean that the use of employment credit checks may make it more difficult for law enforcement agencies to hire and promote a diverse police force that reflects the jurisdiction it is policing. As law enforcement agencies across the country continue to face decades-old concerns about sufficient opportunities for people of color to be hired and promoted within their ranks, the use of employment credit checks exacerbates this core civil rights concern.
Credit checks are not justified for employees of financial institutions. Like other exemptions, a carve-out allowing banks and other financial institutions to continue doing credit checks is based on the misconception that someone who has faced financial challenges in their own life will not be a good employee at a financial institution. In fact, financial services is the only specific industry to have been the subject of a rigorous academic study: the research, published in the Psychologist-Manager Journal in 2012 analyzed employees holding jobs falling within a “financial services and collections” job category of a large financial services organization. The study found that information in the credit reports of these employees had no relationship with employee performance or employee terminations for misconduct (or any other negative reason). In other words, credit reports do no predict job performance in a financial services job.
Broad standards-based exceptions are entirely unjustified. The worst categories of exceptions are those that permit credit checks based on broad standards, such as “relevance”, “fiduciary duty” or “substantially job related.” These exceptions are even less justified than exceptions for specific job categories, because they are overly expansive and leave many workers unprotected from the unfairness of employment credit checks.
New York City has an opportunity to lead the nation in a progressive direction by enacting the nation’s strongest law prohibiting credit discrimination. Instead of mimicking weakened state laws, New York should look to Senator Elizabeth Warren’s inspiring Equal Employment for All Act for model legislation that bans credit discrimination without exemptions. In fact, the only major difference between New York City’s current strong bill and Senator Warren’s is that in the current legislative climate, New York’s bill stands a better chance of becoming law.",blog

I was first fired for my sexual orientation and gender expression at 19. 
I was working as a bank teller. It was the first job where I had ever made more than minimum wage. It wasn’t enough to live on, but it was close. 
My boss, John, called me into his office and told me he had good news and bad news. He shared the good news first—that he was getting a promotion. Then he shared the bad news—his replacement was a woman who had told him she didn’t like my lifestyle or my look. Three days later, she fired me.
My experience was far from unusual. Today, more than half of states still permit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in employment, housing, public accommodations, education, credit, and jury service.
A lack of protections from discrimination is one reason why lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) people, and especially LGBTQ people of color and transgender people, are much more likely to experience precarious employment and/or be living in poverty. Forty percent of young people experiencing homelessness identify as LGBTQ. Bisexual women are among the most likely to participate in SNAP, better known as food stamps. Transgender people are more than twice as likely to be living in poverty as the general population; 43 percent of Latinx and 38 percent of black transgender people live in poverty.
I wonder, sometimes, whether things would have been different if there had been non-discrimination protections in my state at the time. It’s possible that it would have; laws can press our social norms in the direction of progress, and it’s possible the woman would have felt differently, or would have been frightened of the legal repercussions of acting out her bias.
It’s also possible that everything would have happened in exactly the same way. Nondiscrimination protections are a critical part of the legal fabric that protects workers. But for me, like for many people who have marginalized identities, enforcement of those protections would have been out of reach when I needed it most.
The legal costs associated with bringing an employment discrimination lawsuit can run to the tens of thousands of dollars. A suit may also require an investment of time that’s not feasible for a person who is struggling to make ends meet.  
Reading Demos’ recent briefing book, Everyone’s Economy, I was struck by how critical the policies are to one another. The guarantee of fair employment works best when there are strong enforcement mechanisms in place and when people who need the protections the most can access enforcement. The freedom to join in union and negotiate at work is also a central part of how we ensure that people can access enforcement of their rights.
Labor unions are one of the critical tools that help people who are facing discrimination in the workplace access the mechanisms of enforcement. Workers who might otherwise be unable to afford the time or expense associated with a discrimination lawsuit can count on their union to help—but only if their rights to collective bargaining are secure.
Today, those rights are under attack. So-called right-to-work laws, which make it more difficult for workers to engage in collective bargaining and other union activities, are currently on the books in more than half the states. It’s no surprise that the map of states that have right-to-work laws and the map of states that lack LGBTQ non-discrimination laws are nearly identical. 
On the International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia (IDAHOT), it is critical for us to consider how our economy impacts people living at the intersections of multiple marginalized identities. Today, we commit to fighting for workplace equity for LGBTQ people.
For more information, check out Intersecting Injustice, a recent publication from the LGBTQ Poverty Collaborative, which explores more deeply how workplace issues impact LGBTQ people who are living in poverty.

"Walmart's raises to $9 an hour in 2015 and then to $10 an hour in 2016 is a positive step forward, but it still falls short of giving workers the wages they need.
The productivity of American workers is on the rise. However, real wages have actually declined for most U.S. employees since 2009, with low-paid workers seeing the greatest decrease in their paychecks.1 Facing growing demands from workers earning too little to adequately support their families, companies such as the Gap, Ikea, and McDonald’s have recently announced that they will raise the minimum pay for their employees.
Under pressure from its own workers and the public, Walmart stated that it would also increase wages for its 500,000 lowest-paid U.S. workers. In April 2015, the nation’s largest employer hiked its minimum wages to $9 an hour; another increase to $10 an hour will take effect in February 2016 for all workers who have completed a 6-month training period.2 This is a positive step forward, but it still falls short of giving Walmart’s frontline workers the wages they deserve—and need—to provide a decent standard of living for their families. 
In this research brief, we utilize the Living Wage Calculator of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to evaluate the adequacy of Walmart’s wage increase in supporting workers and their families.
As we noted in the Demos report A Higher Wage is Possible at Walmart, this company is particularly important because it sets the standard for the retail sector—one of the nation’s fastest growing economic sectors.3 With more than 1.4 million employees, Walmart is the nation’s largest private employer.
Walmart’s practices also impact the public sector and taxpayers when employees earn too little to meet their needs and require public assistance.3 Finally, Walmart’s current practices make it a leader in the type of employment model where workers earn too little to generate the consumer demand necessary for hiring and economic recovery.
For all these reasons, it is important to put a spotlight on the consequences of Walmart’s low wage approach. We use the MIT living wage calculator to test the adequacy of Walmart’s proposed $10 wage floor. The calculator is a measure of basic needs for various family types in each state in the country.
It includes the minimum cost of food, child care, health insurance, housing, transportation, and basic necessities such as clothing and personal care items in different states to provide geographically specific projections of the cost of living, as well as the baseline wage level necessary to afford a basic standard of living. We analyze wages for workers employed at Walmart’s full-time standard of 34 hours a week, a part-time schedule of 20 hours a week, and a more robust schedule of 40 hours a week.
It’s worth emphasizing that the $10 wage only affects workers who have completed a 6 month on-boarding and training period: with the high turnover rate that prevails in the retail industry, many workers will leave the company before they ever get to $10 an hour. As a result, a number of Walmart workers will remain below the $10 an hour threshold. Walmart’s forthcoming $10 an hour wage is equivalent to $17,680 annually for an employee working Walmart’s full-time standard of 34 hours a week.
Yet even in low-cost states such as Nebraska, Oklahoma, Ohio, South Dakota and Walmart’s home state of Arkansas, this wage provides only about 90 percent of what a single employee needs for a basic standard of living. In the median state nationwide, Walmart’s wage of $10 an hour for 34 hours a week provides just 81 percent of the income needed to support a single adult.
Even for workers able to pick up extra hours and average 40 hours a week for the year, a $10 an hour wage would only meet the needs of a single adult in 17 states. Yet many Walmart workers are not single adults and are not employed full-time. In a recent earnings call, Walmart disclosed that approximately half of its U.S. workforce is employed part time.5 On a sample part-time schedule of 20 hours a week, Walmart’s forthcoming $10 an hour wage is equivalent to only $10,400 a year – less than half of the income needed to afford a basic standard of living for a single adult in 33 states.
The dramatic inadequacy of part-time wages is particularly troubling given that, compared to other U.S. workers, retail employees are disproportionately likely to be involuntarily employed part time.6 In other words, many part-time retail workers want to be working full time but are relegated to part-time hours and grossly inadequate part-time pay.
For workers trying to support a family, a $10 wage falls even shorter of providing a basic standard of living. In the median U.S. state, a Walmart worker paid $10 an hour and working the company’s full-time schedule of 34 hours a week would earn just 39 percent of the income needed to support an adult with a single child. Even if a single parent managed to get scheduled for extra hours and averaged 40 hours a week of work, their pay would remain less than half of the level needed to support a child in most states.
Even two-earner households would struggle to meet basic needs at this wage. Consider a hypothetical family of two Walmart workers, both employed at the forthcoming minimum wage of $10 an hour at the company’s full-time schedule of 34 hours a week. With a pre-tax household income of $35,360 annually, the two-income family would still fall short of meeting basic needs for two children in every state. At best, their earnings would result in just three-quarters of the income needed to support a family of four in even the lowest cost state.
In the median state, their full-time Walmart earnings would meet just 58 percent of the cost of living for their family. Given the inadequacy of Walmart’s planned $10 an hour wage, it is not surprising that Americans for Tax Fairness calculates that Walmart employees would still need substantial tax payer subsidies to make ends meet.7
Programs such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (food stamps) would be needed to support the families of even full-time workers, filling in the gap left by Walmart’s low pay.
In Demos’ previous analysis of Walmart’s finances, we noted that Walmart spent $6.6 billion in 2013 to buy back shares of its own stock.8 Stock buybacks occur when a company repurchases public shares of its own stock, reducing the number of shares traded on the market. Consequently, the same level of earnings are distributed over fewer owners, making each remaining share worth more. These buybacks do nothing to boost Walmart’s productivity or bottom line.
We noted in 2013 that if these funds were redirected to Walmart’s low-wage workers, they would each see a raise of $5.13 an hour – far in excess of the $10 rate Walmart has proposed. In addition, curtailing share buybacks would not damage the company’s competitiveness or raise prices for consumers and could instead help to boost productivity and sales.9
While we cannot claim that our analysis was persuasive for the company, Walmart has in fact decreased its rate of share repurchases, redirecting funds to “current cash needs” which may include the wage increases currently planned for the lowest paid workers.10 Yet Walmart could do far more. As Walmart noted in its most recent annual report, as of January 31, 2015, authorization for $10.3 billion of share repurchases remained under the current share repurchase program.
Additionally, Walmart brought in more revenue than any other company in the world in 2014, yielding $16.182 billion in net profit in the fiscal year ending in January 2015.11 Clearly, substantial additional resources are available to invest in the company’s frontline workforce. 
The growing body of research on human capital management in retail finds that experienced employees with broad knowledge of the company are better equipped to serve customers, leading to higher sales numbers and better performance overall.12 Research from management experts at the Wharton School of Business shows that stores see an average of $10 in new revenue for every additional dollar spent on payroll.13
Better staffing practices lead to higher sales, since customers can rely on stocked shelves and knowledgeable employees. Further, by putting more money in the pockets of workers who will spend it immediately, consumer spending would increase at Walmart’s own stores and improve company performance.
This year Walmart unveiled a television advertisement publicizing its wage increase, acknowledging that “it’s hard to see a future if you can’t see past today. That’s why Walmart is investing in the most important part of our company: our people. Because a raise in pay raises us all.”14
The company’s reasoning is sound, but the planned increase to $10 an hour does not go far enough, especially for part-time employees who want additional or full-time hours. The nation’s largest private employer is the pacesetter for America’s economy: Walmart has a singular opportunity to lead on the improvement of wages and schedules, setting a higher floor for workers who deserve better.",research
"Our personal information is compiled, traded, analyzed and sold off as never before. Not only do business and government track us online, but retailers trace our cell phones through stores, and vast, little-known databases can keep us from getting jobs, qualifying for loans, and opening bank accounts. Three news reports this week highlight the growing impact of these databases on our daily lives – and the critical need for oversight to ensure that information is compiled accurately, that errors can be fixed, and that the resulting data is used fairly rather than becoming a new means of discrimination against already-disadvantaged citizens. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, whose director was finally confirmed by Congress after more than two years of delay, will have its work cut out for it.
Consider the report in today’s New York Times finding that more than a million low-income Americans have been denied the opportunity to open bank accounts because of little-known databases that penalize them for sometimes minor banking mistakes in their past, including bouncing checks, overdrawing bank accounts, and accumulating fees. Blacklisted from opening bank accounts, many consumers turn to high-cost check cashing operations, wire services, and prepaid cards, which drain their paychecks and make it difficult to save money. While banks have a legitimate interest in deterring fraud, a lack of proportionality and the challenge many consumers face in correcting errors can cripple access to a fair marketplace for basic financial services.
The Times recounts the story of Brooklyn resident Tiffany Murrell, who was locked out of the banking system because she overdrew her bank account by “roughly $40 in June 2010.” Although she repaid the amount, plus interest and fees, before applying for a new account, Murrell was repeatedly turned down for a new account.
And what if the alleged financial transgression wasn’t even yours? Julie Miller of Oregon worked for years to get credit reporting giant Equifax to correct a mistake in its vast database that resulted from the company mixing up her file with the records of a different Julie Miller. The consequences were serious: ""There was damage to her reputation, a breach of her privacy and the lost opportunity to seek credit. She has a brother who is disabled and who can't get credit on his own and she wasn't able to help him,"" explained Justin Baxter, the lawyer she ultimately retained to sue the company. This week Miller won $18.6 million in damages against Equifax, as the U.S. District Court ruled that the corporation had violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act’s requirement that credit reporting companies assure maximum possible accuracy of the information in consumer reports and other requirements.
As I have noted previously, errors in credit reports are all too common. A recent study by the Federal Trade Commission found that 21 percent of credit reports contain material errors and that as 10 million Americans have errors in their credit reports so serious that they would likely pay more for auto loans or other credit, or could be shut out entirely. The ruling in Miller v. Equifax suggests what advocates have been saying for a long time: the major credit reporting companies have been grossly violating their obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act for decades and the CFPB cannot act quickly enough to clean up the industry.
At least the FBI’s criminal records database should be the gold standard of accuracy. After all, as the Washington Post points out, employers rely on it to ensure that child sex offenders do not get hired to work at day-care centers, for example. Yet a new report from the National Employment Law Project finds that half of the FBI’s records are faulty.   The study, conducted by Madeline Neighly and Maurice Emsellem, concludes that “1.8 million workers a year are subject to FBI background checks that contain faulty or incomplete information, and 600,000 of those workers may be prejudiced in their job search because the positive outcome of their case is not reflected in the FBI record.” African Americans, who account for a disproportionate percentage of the nation’s arrests (many of which never lead to conviction) are particularly harmed by the flawed records. In this case, Congress must step in to ensure more accurate background checks.
The increased collection and parsing of personal information may be a fact of life, but inaccuracies, hard-to-correct files, and misuse of data is not inevitable. Americans have a right to expect that Congress and the CFPB take action to ensure they are treated fairly.",blog
"Airports are doing it. Big retailers are doing it. Cities are getting in on the action too. Earlier this month, I even got to see the President of the United States do it.
Raising wages for low-paid workers is shaping up to be the hot new trend – and the evidence suggests it will have powerful positive effects on working people, their families, and the health of our economy as a whole. Maintaining a floor on the labor market is a basic workplace standard we’ve allowed to erode at our peril, and raising wages at the bottom is also a critical step toward addressing the inequality corroding our society. At the same time, the growing momentum behind minimum wage hikes provides a chance to consider what it would really take to lift up low-paid jobs and to listen to the workers who are calling for more.
First, let’s consider the benefits of the increases we’ve seen so far. When retailer Gap Inc. announced this week that it would raise its minimum pay for U.S. employees to $10 an hour by 2015, it was making a smart move for its employees, the economy, and even its own bottom line.  As my colleague Catherine Ruetschlin explained in her 2012 study, “Retail’s Hidden Potential” if large retailers like the Gap (which owns six retail brands, including Banana Republic and Old Navy, that will also raise wages) increased pay for all of their US retail workers to at least $12 an hour, more than 700,000 Americans would be lifted out of poverty, GDP would rise more than $11 billion a year, and more than 100,000 new jobs would be created. At the same time, retailers themselves could expect to see sales climb by as much as $5 billion a year as employees use their newfound purchasing power. Increased employee morale and productivity and lower turnover would help to offset increased costs, meaning any effect on consumer prices would be minimal.
As Ruetschlin explained to MSNBC yesterday, Gap Inc. appears to “have a history as an employer that thinks of their employees as a cost rather than an investment… Gap is raising their wages in a decision designed to change their business model” to one that begins to recognize the benefits that investing in employees can have. These benefits to business are explored extensively by MIT management professor Zeynep Ton in her new book The Good Jobs Strategy.
The first question is whether more retailers and other low-wage employers will follow suit. As usual Walmart, the nation’s largest employer with 1.3 million U.S. workers and $17 billion in annual profits, is the elephant in the room. As Ruetschlin and I noted in a recent study, Walmart spent $7.6 billion in 2012 solely to buy back shares of its own stock. Yet the buybacks did nothing to boost Walmart’s productivity or its bottom line. If these funds were redirected to Walmart’s low-wage workers, they would each see a raise of $5.83 an hour, without any increase in costs to consumers at all. Yet Walmart has denied it would even support a minimum wage increase that applied to all workers, despite the clear benefits a wage hike would offer to Walmart's faltering sales. Clearly it will take more for the pioneer of low-wage retail to shift its business model – and Walmart workers themselves, calling for a modest minimum of $25,000 a year, are not letting up the pressure.
It’s a positive step when companies themselves realize the benefits of raising wages, but as the Walmart case vividly illustrates, we can’t count on it. The most straight-forward solution would be for Congress to take action raising the minimum wage for everyone employed in the United States, including a much-needed increase in the tipped minimum wage and a provision linking the minimum wage to inflation, so that its value doesn’t continually erode over time.  Barring that, states and private companies must act – while cities like New York must fight to raise their own minimum wage.  The danger of this piecemeal approach is that it leaves out workers in companies and jurisdictions that fail to raise the wage floor (although workers may vote with their feet to push up pay across borders). The benefit is that it engages citizens, workers, and political and business leaders in a potentially deeper conversation about our jobs, our economy and what it takes to make ends meet in America.
Make no mistake: the policy debates and business model shifts we are seeing today are a result of the powerful strike actions by fast food workers, Walmart workers, federal contract employees, and others who took to the streets in unprecedented numbers over the past two years demanding better pay. But their call was not simply for $10.10 an hour implemented over years: instead fast food workers demand the $15 they assert is needed to support a family with a decent standard of living, and to build a life beyond minimum wage employment, while Walmart workers want $25,000 minimum a year. And workers are calling for  predictable and reliable schedules that give them enough hours to make ends meet, paid sick time to care for families, and employers’ respect for their right to organize unions and engage in the type of collective bargaining that built the American middle class.
The minimum wage sets a critical floor that benefits everyone who goes to work for a living. We should make the most of the recent momentum around raising it to lift pay – and increase the power of low-wage workers to get a better deal on the job. ",blog
"Thank you, Chairperson Alexander and members of the Committee for providing the opportunity to present testimony this morning. I am a Senior Policy Analyst in the Economic Opportunity Program at Dēmos, a national, non-profit, non-partisan policy research and advocacy organization, established in 2000, with offices in Boston, New York, Washington, D.C., and Austin, Texas. The Dēmos Economic Opportunity Program works to achieve a more equitable economy with opportunity for all. I am pleased to be here today to testify in support of Bill 19-38, the Equal Access to Employment for All Act, which aims to prohibit the use of consumer credit checks against prospective and current employees for the purpose of making adverse employment decisions.
REPORT: Discrediting America:The Urgent Need to Reform the Nation's Credit Reporting Industry
Over the past nine years, Dēmos has conducted extensive research on credit card debt among low- and middle -income households. As part of this research, we have become increasingly concerned with how families are being financially penalized for being in debt, making it difficult, if not impossible, for them to ever get out of debt. The proliferation of the use of credit reports and scores in particular have resulted in families in debt being forced to pay more for basic services, such as water and gas, being denied a rental apartment, being charged more for auto or homeowners’ insurance, or, as I’ll discuss today in more detail, being denied a job— which is the very thing they need to get out of debt.
Credit checks increasingly used for employment – despite a lack of evidence for their validity
Six out of ten American employers now look at a job applicant’s credit report when hiring for some or all positions.[1] Employment credit checks have become commonplace because employers are looking for a way to predict if a potential employee will be honest, if they will handle money responsibly, if they are likely to steal or commit fraud. For-profit credit reporting agencies take advantage of these concerns to market credit reports to employers. However, reviewing the social science research on this issue, I have found no credible evidence that credit reports reveal this information.[2]  In fact, one of the major credit reporting agencies has admitted that it has no evidence to support the use of credit checks for employment purposes.[3]
It’s important to emphasize that credit reports evolved as a means for lenders to evaluate whether someone would be a good credit risk based on their past payment history. These reports detail whether someone has fallen behind on their bills, whether they have had to declare bankruptcy, and if they’ve faced foreclosure.  In fact, credit reports can be a good indicator of the tremendous economic stresses that are facing households in the District of Columbia during these difficult economic times.  Demos’ extensive research on credit card debt among middle- and low-income households has found that most indebted families go into debt to pay for basic expenses: groceries, utilities, child care, and health care. In fact, in a 2008 survey we commissioned of low-and-moderate income households, 37% of credit card indebted families had used their credit cards to pay for basic expenses and 52% had used them to pay for medical care in the past year.[4] Simply put, Americans are borrowing to make ends meet.
You can often see the effects of that economic hardship in a credit report. What a credit report will not reveal is how well applicants are likely to perform on the job. The use of credit reports for employment purposes has no validity – and it’s our position that there is no job category in which they have proven to be useful or reliable. For any employer that comes before this committee asserting that they need the opportunity to inquire about a prospective employees’ credit history, I respectfully suggest that you ask them for the evidence that this consumer credit history reveals something relevant about a job applicant’s qualifications.
Employment credit checks are discriminatory
In addition to their irrelevance, employment credit checks are also discriminatory, and I urge the committee to think of Bill 19-38 as a significant piece of civil rights legislation. The reality is that employment credit checks disproportionately impact communities of color. For this reason organizations including the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights, National Council of La Raza, and the NAACP have taken repeated stands against employment credit checks.[5] Various factors contribute to racial disparities in credit scores. People of color have a higher unemployment rate, a higher poverty rate, and have fewer assets, on average, that they can draw on in an emergency. All of that makes people more likely to use credit and to go into debt to deal with emergencies. There are also issues of credit being offered on discriminatory terms – in the last decade predatory lending schemes targeting communities of color compounded historic disparities in wealth and assets, leaving African-Americans, Latinos, and other people of color at greater risk of foreclosure and default on loans.[6]
Employment credit checks can perpetuate and amplify this injustice. In a 2007 report, the Federal Reserve Board found that African-Americans and Latinos had considerably lower credit scores than non-Hispanic whites.[7] A number of other studies, from the Brookings Institution to the Federal Trade Commission, came to similar conclusions.[8] I delve into that research in a report I authored on credit screening, which I am pleased to provide to members of the committee.[9] The Department of Labor won a case last year against Bank of America in which the bank was found to have discriminated against African Americans by using credit checks to hire entry level employees.[10] A similar case brought by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is now pending against Kaplan Higher Education Corporation.[11] The use of credit checks in hiring is, at its heart, a civil rights issue and an employment discrimination issue, and ironically, the same employers that seek protection by using the practice may find themselves with legal liability as a result of it.
Exemptions are unnecessary
I would like to take a moment to address the exemptions in this legislation. As it is currently written, Bill 19-38 permits the continued use of employment credit checks in the case of jobs that require national security or FDIC clearance; positions with a state or local government agency; supervisory, managerial, professional, or executive positions at a financial institution; or when otherwise required by law. It extends beyond my expertise to comment on matters of national security, but for these other categories of exemptions, I reassert that there is no evidence that credit checks are useful or reliable.
I would especially urge the committee to rethink the exemption for state or local employees – credit checks can shut qualified people out of public employment, which harms both job seekers and the public that could benefit from their services. In fact, the City of Hartford, CT unanimously passed an ordinance prohibiting its own public agencies from performing credit checks as part of the employment process for city jobs.[12] Since there is no evidence that credit checks are a valid means of predicting employee performance or fraud, Hartford decided to set an example and stop using them, including no exemptions in its bill. The District of Columbia might consider that as well.
Finally, this powerful piece of civil rights legislation needs an enforcement mechanism. Providing people who have been discriminated against through an employment credit check with a private right of action would be a suitable way to enforce the law.
Conclusion
These unwarranted exemptions aside, the Equal Access to Employment for All Act will remove an unnecessary barrier that prevents qualified DC residents from getting the work they need. By enacting this bill, the Council will join the growing number of jurisdictions – including seven states, from California to Connecticut – that have taken action to restrict the use of credit checks in employment. I urge you to pass this legislation. Thank you.

"Over the past decade, Demos has conducted extensive research on credit card debt among low- and middle-income households. As part of this research, we have become increasingly concerned with how families are being financially penalized for being in debt, making it difficult, if not impossible, for them to ever get out of debt. In 2012, we surveyed a nationally representative sample of about a thousand low- and middle-income households that were carrying credit card debt for three months or longer. I was the principal researcher on that study. In addition to the questions Demos asked in the past about credit card debt I began to ask about the experience of these households with employment credit checks.
My first finding is that in the survey population employment credit checks are common. Among the households in the survey population that experienced unemployment, about one in seven say that a prospective employer has asked to check their personal credit history. But it’s likely that this really understates the extent of employment credit checks: people are asked to sign a lot of things when they apply for jobs and they may not remember every piece of paper.
I also found that credit checks have a real impact – people are shut out of job opportunities because of their credit. Under the terms of the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act employers are required to provide official notification if a credit report played any role in a decision not to hire someone.
The problem is that this is hard to enforce, so many job applicants may never find out that their credit report was the reason they were denied work. Nevertheless, some people are informed, and among those in the survey population who report that they had poor credit, one in seven report that they have been advised that they would not be hired for some position because of their credit. This indicates that credit checks really are a barrier to employment.
What does a credit report really reveal about someone? I found that poor or declining credit is associated with households experiencing job loss, lacking health coverage, or having medical debt. 
New York City recently passed landmark legislation outlawing job discrimination against people who are currently unemployed. Unfortunately, employment credit checks are another means of discrimination against people who are out of work: it’s hard to maintain good credit when your household has been coping with extended unemployment. That’s exactly what I found in this research.
I found a number of different connections between medical debt and poor credit. I found that 55 percent – more than half – of those who report having poor credit say that “unpaid medical bills or medical debt” contributed to their poor credit. That’s a huge impact. That includes people who have health insurance of one kind or another. But among the uninsured in our sample, the impact on credit appears even more powerful. Households that include someone who is uninsured are more than twice as likely to describe their credit as poor and are also more than twice as likely to say that their credit score has declined significantly over the past three years, compared to households where everyone has insurance coverage. This is consistent with a study by the Federal Reserve Board which found that 52 percent of all accounts reported by collection agencies that appeared on credit reports consisted of medical debt.
A lot of what employers are looking at on credit reports is medical debt, but they don’t know that.
We also find that in our sample Latino and particularly African American households are more likely to report having poor credit and less likely to report having good or excellent credit than white households. For example, 65 percent of white households in our sample describe their credit as “good” or “excellent” compared to just 44 percent of African American households. Latino households tend to fall somewhere in the middle. Unfortunately our sample sizes were too small to have statistically significant data about other racial or ethnic groups. 
Our data on racial disparities is consistent with previous research, including findings by the Federal Reserve Board and the Brookings Institution.
Other researchers have pointed out that a number of factors contribute to the racial disparity in credit quality: unemployment is higher in communities of color and there’s a tremendous underlying disparity in wealth and assets compared to white households. There’s also a legacy of predatory lending that disproportionately impacts communities of color. All of this may contribute to worse credit. Employment credit checks can amplify and perpetuate this racial discrimination.
Finally, I’d like to address credit reporting errors. A comprehensive new study by the Federal Trade Commission finds that 21 percent of American consumers have some kind of error on their credit report.
They found a smaller percentage of consumers have errors that would actually affect their credit score in a way that would make it harder for them to get a loan, but I think this 21 percent number is the most relevant for the employment context, because employer assessments of a credit report are entirely subjective. Employers are not looking at a three-digit credit score; they’re looking at list of credit accounts, how much the job applicant owes and whether they are paying as agreed or are late. There is no universally accepted way to interpret this information. Credit reports were developed to guide lenders, not employers. There is a real lack of social science research proving that any credit information is relevant to job performance. An error that might be too small to affect the outcome in a lending scenario could stand out to an employer and make the difference and keep someone from getting hired.
In conclusion, we find that in our survey population employment credit checks are common and they are keeping people from getting jobs. Yet poor credit is associated with a host of factors that we don’t generally see as legitimate reasons to deny people employment: it’s associated with lack of health coverage, with medical debt, and with unemployment. We also find that people of color are disproportionately likely to report poor credit. And we see a high rate of errors in credit reports. . Employers may not realize this is what they are looking at on a credit report, but to a large extent, it is. The Dēmos study is another piece of evidence that employment credit checks are an illegitimate barrier to employment. And so I urge the Committee on Civil Rights to stop this discrimination by passing Intro 857. Thank you.",testimony-and-public-comment
"Your personal data was very likely stolen by hackers this summer—yet Congress wants less oversight of the company that failed to keep our private information safe.
On September 7, the credit reporting company Equifax revealed it had experienced a gigantic data breach affecting 143 million American consumers, equivalent to half of the U.S. population and nearly three-quarters of consumers with credit reports. Social Security numbers, birth dates, and drivers’ license numbers are among the pieces of sensitive data potentially compromised. To prevent identity theft, consumer advocates recommend that people who may have been affected by the breach consider placing a security freeze on their credit reports with all 3 of the major credit reporting companies. Experts at the U.S. Public Interest Research Group have additional tips for consumers dealing with the breach.
Why did the breach occur? Hackers are always on the lookout for vulnerabilities, and the New York Times reports that Equifax failed to improve its security practices after it experienced previous data breaches that devastated consumers. It’s worth considering Equifax’s business model and why it neglected to invest adequately in protecting consumer data.
Equifax, a multibillion-dollar private business, profits by gathering and reporting private financial data about individual consumers, often without their knowledge or permission. When Americans apply for any type of credit or loan, try to purchase insurance, apply for a job or rent an apartment, the lender, insurance company, employer or landlord can purchase a report of the consumer’s past borrowing activity (a credit report) from Equifax or one of the other two massive credit reporting companies. Individuals have no right to opt out of data collection or to cease doing business with Equifax. For more on the many problems with the for-profit credit reporting model, including the ways that the misuse of credit reporting can reproduce and deepen racial inequities, see Demos’ report Discrediting America.
The upshot is that while Equifax trades in our personal information, their profits derive primarily from the big lenders and insurance companies that use our data to determine who to lend to and how much to charge. Those corporations are the clients Equifax serves; American consumers are merely sources of marketable data.
The latest data breach is just another sign that credit reporting companies lack sufficient stake in the integrity of consumer information. If we’re going to continue to have a private, for-profit credit reporting system, companies must be subject to close oversight and regulation. As a last resort, consumers who are wronged by credit reporting negligence—which could cause them to become victims of identity theft, be shut out of job opportunities, be denied loans or pay much higher interest rates—must be able to hold companies fully accountable in court.
And yet on the very day that Equifax revealed the massive breach of consumer data, the House Financial Services Committee was holding hearings on legislation to reduce consumers’ ability to hold credit reporting companies accountable for their failures. Demos joined consumer advocacy organizations in a letter of opposition to H.R. 2359, the FCRA Liability Harmonization Act, arguing that the legislation would restrict Americans’ access to justice and reduce credit reporting companies’ incentive to abide by consumer protections.
At the same time, Congress is trying to undermine the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which regulates and oversees credit reporting companies along with other types of financial services companies. The Equifax hack vividly illustrates why we need that oversight and regulation strengthened rather than rolled back.  ",blog
"On Wednesday the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission took the historic step of updating its guidance on the use of criminal records in employment screening. Since a disproportionate number of Americans with criminal records come from low-income communities of color, this is a major civil rights victory. Based on the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the EEOC has long held that it is illegal for employers to exclude job applicants on account of their criminal record unless the crime is directly relevant to the job in question. But in the absence of up-to-date guidance from the EEOC, 90 percent of employers now conduct criminal background checks on some or all job candidates. It’s clear that new guidelines were needed to help courts, employers, and private screening firms act in a responsible and non-discriminatory fashion and to prevent a situation in which, “old arrests and minor convictions can turn into life sentences of joblessness” in the words of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.
The EEOC should be applauded for its critical move on criminal background checks. But more remains to be done. On Wednesday, the EEOC passed up an opportunity to issue guidance on employment credit checks, failing to make the case that disqualifying someone from a job due to their poor credit also erects a discriminatory barrier to employment. 
The evidence that the use of employment credit checks is having a disparate impact on communities of color is strong. Studies from the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Trade Commission and others have consistently that found that average credit scores of African Americans are lower than those of whites. In addition, credit continues to be offered on discriminatory terms: in the last decade predatory lending schemes targeting communities of color compounded historic disparities in wealth and assets, leaving African-Americans, Latinos, and other people of color at greater risk of foreclosure and default on loans.
Since the financial crash, households of color have lost more than half of their family wealth—leaving them with fewer assets to fall back on during emergencies to avoid debt. This compares to a 16 percent loss among white households. Today, families of color have less than a dime in wealth for every dollar held by white families. Employment credit checks can perpetuate and amplify this injustice, translating a legacy of unfair lending into another subtle means of employment discrimination.
The courts have recognized the discriminatory impact of employment credit screening. The Department of Labor won a verdict against Bank of America based partially on the bank’s use of credit checks to hire entry-level employees, which had a discriminatory impact on African-Americans.
Employment credit checks can also have a discriminatory impact on other protected groups: since more than half of all accounts reported to collection agencies are for medical debts, employers are effectively inquiring into job applicants’ private health history when they require an employment credit check.  This violates the spirit of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Finally, we know that in many cases women who are the victims of domestic abuse will have credit problems because their abuser has intentionally damaged their credit.  Requiring that these women undergo a credit check as a condition of employment is likely to bring the highly personal details into the hiring process. 
Unfortunately, the EEOC will not have another opportunity to take action on employment credit checks for several months. Commissioner Stuart Ishimaru has announced that he will resign at the end of April,  effectively blocking guidance on employment credit checks until a new commissioner is named.  President Obama should nominate a new commissioner quickly: to truly ensure equal employment for all, the EEOC must follow its important action on criminal background checks with strong guidance addressing the use of credit checks in employment decisions.  ",blog
"According to reports, Ivanka Trump is passionate about paid parental leave. Even as the Trump administration pushes a bill stripping health coverage from 22 million Americans and promotes a budget that slashes funding for basic food, shelter, heating, child care, elder care, education, job training and workplace safety programs (combined with yet more cuts to health coverage), the first daughter is making the rounds on Capitol Hill, contending that things will work out for American families if only new parents get the opportunity to take 6 weeks of paid leave for the birth or adoption of a child.
For staunch, long-time supporters of paid family leave, this is a cruel joke—and the crudest kind of distraction.
In our recent study, The Parent Trap, my Demos colleagues and I looked at how a lack of paid family leave combines with other stressors like a shortage of quality, affordable child care; irregular work schedules; jobs that don’t pay family-supporting wages; and household debt (including medical debt) to leave American parents trapped between the need to provide care for their children and the necessity of earning income. One thing was clear: loosening the shackles of one part of the “parent trap” could not make up for tightening every other constraint. This is especially true for single mothers, low-income parents, and parents of color, who face the greatest barriers to supporting and raising a family.
While it is impossible to isolate Trump’s paid leave plan from the larger budget context, the plan remains inadequate when considered on its own merits. By incorporating paid leave only to care for a newborn or newly adopted child, for example, the plan excludes the millions of Americans who need leave to deal with a long-term illness of their own, or to care for a sick child or other loved one during an extended illness. What’s more, the duration of leave is miserably short—just half of the 12-week standard set by the nation’s unpaid leave program more than two decades ago. And by proposing to run paid leave through state unemployment insurance systems, it would dangerously stress those programs even as it binds parents to the programs’ restrictive eligibility rules.
Demos is proud to be among the more than 340 organizations supporting the National Partnership for Women and Families’ letter condemning Trump’s unacceptable plan and laying out clear standards for any adequate plan for paid family and medical leave. A strong, responsible paid leave policy must:
Paid leave is not a pie-in-the-sky vision. California, New Jersey and Rhode Island have been successfully guaranteeing paid family leave to residents for years, and New York State will begin to roll out its paid leave program in January 2018. Washington State is also on the verge of implementing its own paid leave plan. And a national plan that meets the basic standards has been repeatedly introduced in Congress: the FAMILY Act, sponsored by Rep. Rosa DeLauro and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. While there is a strong case to be made that America should aspire to a still higher standard for paid leave in line with the standards of other developed countries, there is little question that the Trump plan falls dramatically short.
By peddling her own watered down plan, which is gaining little traction among Republican senators who have little interest in anything beyond tax credits, Ivanka Trump may be aiming to undermine support for this more robust vision. The long list of signers – from the National Organization for Women to the National Council of La Raza and the AFL-CIO—suggest that this strategy will fail. If Ivanka Trump truly cares about the well-being of families with young children, she should be fighting for a budget and health care law that support them, and a strong paid family leave law. ",blog
"Thank you, Chairperson Carroll and members of the Committee for this opportunity to present testimony. I am a Senior Policy Analyst in the Economic Opportunity Program at Dēmos. We are a national, non-partisan research and advocacy organization, established in 2000 and headquartered in New York City. The Dēmos Economic Opportunity Program works to achieve a more equitable economy with opportunity for all.
I am pleased to be here today to testify on Senate Bill 3, the Employment Opportunity Act, which prohibits the use of consumer credit information for employment purposes if the information is unrelated to the job.
Over the past nine years, Dēmos has conducted extensive research on credit card debt among low- and middle-income households. As part of this research, we have become increasingly concerned with how families are being financially penalized for being in debt, making it difficult, if not impossible, for them to ever get out of debt. The proliferation of the use of credit reports and scores in particular have resulted in families in debt being forced to pay more for basic services, such as water and gas, being denied a rental apartment, being charged more for auto or homeowners’ insurance, or, as I’ll discuss today in more detail, being denied a job — which is the very thing they need to get out of debt.
Credit checks are an unnecessary barrier to employment: by restricting their use, this legislation will help put people back to work and ensure that all job seekers have a fair shot at gainful employment.
Six out of ten American employers now look at a job applicant’s credit report when hiring for some or all positions.[1] A brief, informal survey of job listings throughout the state of Colorado reveals that employers today are requiring credit checks for positions as diverse as maintenance work, telephone tech support, plumbing, work as a home care aide, and scooping frozen yogurt.[2]
Employment credit checks have become commonplace because employers are looking for a way to predict if a potential employee will be honest, if they will handle money responsibly, if they are likely to steal or commit fraud.[3] For-profit credit reporting agencies take advantage of these concerns to market credit reports to employers. However, reviewing the social science research on this issue, I have found no credible evidence that credit reports reveal this information.[4]  In fact, a spokesperson for one of the major credit reporting agencies has admitted that he has seen no evidence to support the use of credit checks for employment purposes.[5]
It’s important to emphasize that credit reports evolved as a means for lenders to evaluate whether someone would be a good credit risk based on their past payment history. These reports detail whether someone has fallen behind on their bills, whether they have had to declare bankruptcy, and if they’ve faced foreclosure.  In fact, credit reports can be a good indicator of the tremendous economic stresses that are facing Colorado families during these difficult economic times.  Demos’ research on credit card debt among middle- and low-income households has found that most indebted families go into debt to pay for basic expenses: groceries, utilities, child care, and health care. In a 2008 survey we commissioned of low-and-moderate income households, 37% of credit card indebted families had used their credit cards to pay for basic expenses and 52% had used them to pay for medical care in the past year.[6] Simply put, Americans are borrowing to make ends meet.
You can often see the effects of that economic hardship in a credit report. What a credit report will not reveal is how well applicants are likely to perform on the job. The use of credit reports for employment purposes has no validity – and it’s our position that there is no job category in which they have proven to be useful or reliable.
In addition to their irrelevance, employment credit checks are also discriminatory, and I urge the committee to think of SB 3 as a piece of civil rights legislation. The reality is that employment credit checks disproportionately impact Latinos and African Americans, whose credit histories have suffered as a result of discrimination in lending, housing and employment itself.[7]  Employment credit checks can perpetuate and amplify this historic injustice. For this reason organizations including the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights, National Council of La Raza, and the NAACP have taken repeated stands against employment credit checks.[8] The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has sued two employers for the discriminatory impact of their use of credit reports as a hiring tool, demonstrating that credit reports may introduce legal liability to employers.
I’d also like to raise the issue of privacy, because that is another concern as we consider employment credit checks. Americans should not have to expose the details a painful divorce or past medical condition just to get a job. Yet because family break-up and medical problems are among the leading reasons that Americans become unable to pay their debts, these deeply personal concerns are often revealed in an employment credit check, particularly if an applicant is asked by a prospective employer to “explain” their imperfect credit history. 
I would like to take a moment to address the exemption in this legislation. As it is currently written, SB 3 permits the continued use of employment credit checks for positions where an employee “has access to money or asset-management decisions.” I would urge you to reconsider this exemption as there is no evidence that credit checks are useful or reliable for determining who can safely handle money or make management decisions. In addition, this exemption has the potential to be interpreted far more broadly than it might have been intended: a wide range of employees, including front-line retail workers and people employed in food service, have access to money at work. Weak credit should not be a reason to deny them access to employment.
The unwarranted exemption aside, the Employment Opportunity Act will remove an unnecessary barrier that prevents qualified Coloradans from getting the work they need. By enacting this bill, the state will join the growing number of jurisdictions – including seven states, from California to Illinois to Connecticut – that have taken action to restrict the use of credit checks in employment. I urge you to pass this legislation. Thank you.

"Americans cumulatively have $854 billion in revolving loan (mostly credit card) debt, according to the Federal Reserve. The amount has actually declined since the Great Recession, as credit card issuers tightened their lending standards, borrowers became more cautious, and strong and effective consumer protection laws went into effect, producing substantial savings for households. Still, $854 billion is no small matter, and its source is worth considering. Why do some people stagger under a mountain of credit card debt, paying high interest rates on their outstanding balances and never seeming to come out ahead, while others rarely if ever carry debt for long, despite pulling out their plastic on a regular basis?
That’s the question I set out to answer in a new study, which compares two groups of low- and middle-income households with working age adults. The households are statistically indistinguishable in terms of income, racial and ethnic background, age, marital status and rate of homeownership—yet one group carries credit card debt, while the other has credit cards but no debt. The study builds on Demos’ 2012 national survey of a statistically representative sample of 1,997 low- and middle-income households with and without credit card debt.
One clear finding is that credit card debt is closely correlated with the absence of health coverage: households in which a member has gone without health insurance at some point in the last three years are 20 percent more likely to be carrying credit card debt than households in which no one has been uninsured. This suggests a potential benefit of the Affordable Care Act that is seldom discussed—by increasing the number of Americans with health coverage, Obamacare may cut our credit card debt.
Yet the most complete insurance coverage can leave households with steep costs for premiums, co-payments and deductibles—expenses that the majority of households with credit card debt say contribute to their outstanding balance. Even with health care reform in place, getting sick or managing a chronic condition can lead to ongoing debt burdens.
It’s no surprise that losing income can make it hard to pay bills and all-too-easy to accumulate debt. So it made sense to find a strong association between households that had credit card debt and those that had experienced unemployment. What was unexpected was the duration of this effect: households where someone had been unemployed for at least two months are 14 percent more likely to be carrying credit card debt than households that were not hit by joblessness—even if the unemployment spell was as long as three years ago.
Households with more education, and more assets to draw on, were also far less likely to be carrying credit card debt. This finding corresponds to the larger body of research on the role of wealth and assets: when a family has assets, they gain a measure of stability in times of economic stress. In contrast, when households don’t have assets to fall back on, they may turn to credit cards and other forms of borrowing to meet basic expenses when an unforeseen crisis hits. The reliance on revolving credit further increases a household’s economic vulnerability and the probability that they will need to rely on credit cards in the future. Borrowers can get trapped in a vicious cycle.
So what doesn’t correlate with credit card debt? Contrary to popular belief, there’s little evidence that households with credit card debt are less responsible in their spending habits than households that do not have accumulated debt. Instead, among similarly situated low- and middle-income households, unemployment, education, health care coverage and the value of assets households have to fall back on are the major predictors of credit card debt.
Public and business policies have yet to catch up to this reality. For example, nearly half of all employers persist in reviewing personal credit history—including credit card debt—when hiring new employees. That’s largely because companies peddling “credit background checks” assert that a credit report will reveal the inner recesses of a job applicant’s character and sense of personal responsibility—when in fact, it’s says more about the quality of the job-seeker’s health coverage. Similarly, when auto insurance companies factor credit scores into their decisions about their charges, they may really be making judgments that hinge on whether the driver’s spouse was out of work last year. In terms of public policy, efforts to increase health care coverage, boost the creation of high-quality jobs, and shore up the public safety net so that households without assets have more of a financial cushion are likely to make a greater impact on our level of credit card debt than attempts to teach households to be financially responsible.",blog
"Today’s economy doesn’t contain a lot of good news for working people. While the Great Recession officially ended five years ago, millions of Americans are still out of work and wages continue to lag. Yet this week, working people made some hugely significant gains as the fruits sowed by organizing efforts, lawsuits, legislative action—and above all, workers standing up for themselves despite tremendous risk—began to be visible.
The week’s most important victory came in a Tuesday ruling by the National Labor Relations Board which found that McDonald’s is a ‘joint employer’ of workers at its franchised restaurants. The NLRB rightly ruled that company so closely controls and oversees its franchisees that the McDonald’s corporation, together with the franchisees, can now be held accountable for practices that violate employees’ rights. Former NLRB chairwoman Wilma Liebman was quoted in the New York Times explaining that the decision could give fast-food workers leverage to organize unions and raise wages at McDonald’s restaurants nationwide.
The upshot? Fast food workers are a big step closer to winning $15 and a union they have repeatedly gone on strike to attain. And they are energized to win the fight: at their first ever national convention last weekend, fast food workers vowed to intensify their efforts through non-violent civil disobedience. After all, it’s clear that fast food giants like McDonald’s can well afford to pay workers more. In fact, research by my Demos colleague Catherine Ruetschlin shows that poverty wages and sky-high pay packages for executives at McDonalds and other fast food corporations have combined to destabilize the companies to such an extent that investors should be concerned.
Workers could also see big gains from two bills being introduced in Congress. On Wednesday, Representative Keith Ellison will introduce a bill making it easier for workers to independently take legal action against companies that violate their right to organize, without going through a slow, prolonged process with the NLRB. As it stands now, employers frequently retaliate against workers who try to form unions with impunity, illegally terminating workers in as many as one in three union elections with little consequence. Moving the process to the civil court system could speed up cases and raise penalties, giving employers greater incentives to respect workers’ legal right to organize.
Meanwhile last Wednesday, Senators Tom Harkin and Elizabeth Warren joined Representatives George Miller and Rosa DeLauro to introduce the Schedules that Work Act, which would address the unpredictable and unstable schedules that leave many workers scrambling. The bill would mandate that employees in some industries receive schedules in advance, be paid for at least four hours on a shift, and protect workers from retaliation if they request more flexible, predictable or stable schedule from their employer. A recent Demos study examined the particularly harmful impact of emerging scheduling practices for women in the retail industry.
There is also a path for President Obama to advance workers’ rights without relying on Congress. Last week, the House Progressive Caucus sent a letter to the President calling on him to build on his executive order raising wages for contract workers by signing a new Good Jobs Executive Order. This measure would crack down on frequently unenforced violations of labor rights by federal contractors; provide a preference in contracting decisions for employers that pay a living wage and offer other basic benefits; and provide a preference in contracting decisions for employers that respect the right of their workers to collectively bargain. My colleagues Robert Hiltonsmith and Lew Daly find that using federal purchasing power in this way could improve the living standards of over 20 million Americans. This Tuesday morning workers in federal buildings in Washington DC walked out on strike demanding an executive order.
Additionally, this has been a big week for pro-worker legislation at the local level. San Francisco introduced a Retail Workers Bill of Rights to address the unstable schedules that make it difficult for retail workers to earn a living and plan for basic needs like child care. The city councils of San Diego, CA and Eugene, OR approved measures to guarantee workers paid sick days. If the bills become law, it would mean that more than 300,000 additional workers gain the right to take up to five paid sick days a year, according to the National Partnership for Women and Families. Meanwhile, workers in New York City can start using sick time they have earned starting July 30. New York’s law extended sick leave to an estimated 1.2 million working people who previously had no access to paid time off the job to recover from illness.
Throughout the economy, job growth has been picking up and long-term unemployment is finally beginning to fall, while 10 million previously uninsured Americans now have health coverage—the benefits of an older legislative fight that could still be stripped away all too easily.
There’s no question that we’ve still got a long way to go: preliminary rulings and bills introduced are not the same as laws passed, rights won, or paychecks in workers’ pockets. But it’s good to savor incremental victories—and prepare to build on them.",blog
"Using political power to keep employees from organizing unions can be highly effective. That’s one forceful lesson to draw from the new figures on union membership released this week by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. According to the BLS, the total number of union members fell by 400,000 in 2012, and unions now represent just 11.3 percent of the nation’s workforce.  As I’ve argued in the past, the continuing decline of organized labor is bad news for the middle class who need power in the workplace to get a fair economic deal.
So where does the political power come in? Most obviously, in states like Wisconsin, where union membership dropped steeply in the wake of Governor Walker’s 2011 law curtailing the ability of most public employees to participate in collective bargaining. Similarly new laws to undercut unions in Michigan and Indiana may have played a role in those states’ falling unionization rates. As the New York Times notes, “union membership fell by 13 percent last year in Wisconsin and by 18 percent in Indiana — both unusually large numbers for a single year.”
But a slower and more subtle use of political influence is also at work across the nation. The promise of the National Labor Relations Act, intended to uphold Americans’ right to band together to bargain for a better deal at work, has been undermined by decades of anti-union legal and political decisions: 
Over the decades, and especially during the Bush years, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) strayed from its mission of protecting workers' rights. The Board increasingly sided with employers, turning a blind eye to employers' anti-union threats and coercion, allowing employers to enact workplace policies that inhibit employees' established rights to freedom of association, and restricting the rights to nurses, temp workers, college instructors, and other broad groups of employees to even make a choice about union representation.
Illegal anti-union tactics by employers grew more pervasive as a result. Research by Cornell University professor Kate Bronfenbrenner reveals that today more than half of employers faced with a union organizing drive illegally threaten to close down their facility if the union wins, while one in three companies illegally fire workers for union activity. Employers regularly engage in surveillance, intimidation and harassment of employees trying to unionize. The NLRB's dereliction of duty means that supporting a union at work now poses workers with a significant risk of getting fired.
Kris Warner of the Center for Economic and Policy Research highlights the impact of this political decision-making by comparing the United States unionization rate to that of Canada, which has gone through similar economic and social changes as the U.S. but has not seen such a dramatic plunge in union membership. The difference, Warner writes, lies in each country's system of rules around how unions can organize and bargain. And things are only getting worse in the United States: the political attack on unions continues with efforts in recent years to further weaken the NLRB  and vigorous opposition to something as simple as putting up a poster to remind employees of rights they’ve had for 76 years. Is it any wonder that unionization rates are declining?
The good news is, if political power can effectively keep Americans from exercising their right to band together and form a union, politics can also smooth the road. Demos has argued for federal legislation to strengthen the right to organize. President Obama’s NLRB can and should also continue working to strengthen regulations protecting workplace rights.
Of course politics isn’t the only influence on the long-term decline of unionization. Factors like increased international trade, technological change, and the shift to a service economy also played a role.
But there’s something else that can’t be left out of the equation: workers themselves. As Sarita Gupta, Executive Director, Jobs with Justice and American Rights at Work points out on Huffington Post
For every union job shed, there is a worker standing up and fighting for a better workplace. While the BLS numbers don't reflect this renewed commitment to worker organizing, we saw it out in full force this year, from Walmart associates, warehouse workers and guest laborers along the giant retailer's supply chain, to fast food workers, to taxi drivers in our country's biggest cities, to port truck drivers at the nation's largest seaports, to car wash workers in the Bronx and warehouse workers at IKEA. Even without the protection of the NLRA at times, these workers are joining together to improve their rights and opportunities on the job… Together, we're not mourning over the decline of unions, we're organizing by building broad-based unity against the attacks on workers, our families and our communities.",blog
" “With this rule, the Administration has made clear that it plans to pursue a partisan agenda to overturn longstanding and effective labor policy.”
That quip by Linda Kelly, Senior Vice President at the virulently anti-union National Association of Manufacturers, should be an early favorite for 2015 quote of the year. The rule that has her trade group and other industry lobbyists up in arms is a commonsense proposal by the National Labor Relations Board to modernize and streamline the process for workers’ to exercise their decades-old right to freely form unions.
The irony stems from Kelly’s insistence that current labor policy is “effective.”
Perhaps from Kelly’s perspective, current labor policy has been effective—at suppressing employees’ efforts to unionize, keeping down wages, and generally preventing most working people from enjoying the benefits of the nascent economic recovery. Over-the-top industry rhetoric aside, a few modest changes to the rules governing union elections won’t fundamentally change those trends. But combined with other recent steps by the NLRB and the Department of Labor, the prospects for working people to regain some leverage in the U.S. economy may start to look brighter.
First, consider that NLRB election rule. Changing the current “effective” procedures is needed because it can take months, even years before workers who have expressed a clear interest in unionizing actually have an opportunity to vote on union representation. In the meantime, delays give employers an opportunity to twist and even break the law in order to prevent their employees from unionizing. Indeed, studies by researchers at Columbia University and the University of California at Berkeley find that the longer the delay between workers’ filing a petition for union representation and the date the NLRB calls for an union election, the more likely it is that the NLRB will issue complaints charging employers with illegal activity, such as unlawfully firing workers for exercising their right to organize, threatening them, or illicitly retaliating against union supporters.  Steps like allowing documents to be filed electronically, rather than by mail, and speeding up the dates of hearings and filings will allow union elections to proceed more quickly, cutting down on opportunities for illegal interference.
Other recent NLRB decisions would also empower working people trying to organize, like a ruling that workers can use their company email accounts for union organizing if they do it on their own time, and a series of legal complaints that aim to hold fast food giant McDonald’s accountable for illegal anti-union activity undertaken by the franchise restaurants which it substantially controls. The McDonald’s case in particular has far reaching implications for other employers that have tried to hide behind franchisees and contractors in order to evade responsibility for mistreatment of employees.
Why do the rules on union organizing matter? Today, just 11.3 percent of wage and salary workers are union members—a steep drop from decades past. But this is far from a story of irrelevance: unions’ decline is at the heart of many of the most persistent problems plaguing the U.S. economy, from rising inequality to stagnant wages to rising corporate dominance of our politics. Researchers find that the decline in union power and density accounts for a full third of the increase in wage inequality among men since 1973 as well as a fifth of the increased inequality among women. When employees lack organized bargaining power in the workplace, it’s not surprising that wages stagnate and an increasingly share of the nation’s economic growth flows to corporate profits. On more personal note for workers, recent academic research even suggests that union members have higher life satisfaction than non-members and that union membership is associated with higher marriage rates, primarily due to “the increased income, regularity and stability of employment, and fringe benefits that come with union membership.”
The past few years have seen a wave of activism by low-paid workers across the country, from Walmart associates to fast food employees to federal contract workers, standing up and calling for better wages and a voice at work. If America’s current labor policy was actually ""effective,"" they wouldn’t have to walk off the job and take to the streets to call for basic rights. Instead, we have a status quo that works only for the National Association of Manufacturers, the Chamber of Commerce, the National Retail Federation, and other business lobby groups with a stake in making sure it remains difficult for working Americans to band together and win their fair share of the economy’s gains. Let’s hope the NLRB continues to modernize and reform the now very ineffective rules intended to give workers a voice. ",blog
"How much would I like to see New York raise its minimum wage? Let's put it this way: in 2001 as New Yorkers fought to increase the minimum from its then-abysmal level of $5.15, I dressed up in a too-large ostrich costume and paraded outside a strip mall in the Bronx. The goofy attire part of a demonstration in front of the district office of then-State Senator Guy Velella (later convicted on corruption charges, now deceased) and it would take another four years and substantial political maneuvering before a minimum wage increase was finally enacted over the veto of Governor Pataki. It’s now ancient history (and luckily, no photos of me dressed as an ostrich seem to survive on the Internet) but one thing remains: New York’s minimum wage is still stuck at $7.25, the level negotiated back in 2004.
As Anna Pycior noted earlier this week, minimum wage hikes are no-brainers -- at least on a substantive level. With polls showing strong public support for minimum wage increases, they should be a political slam dunk as well (Mitt Romney seems to think they are). What's more, New York’s newest proposal to raise the minimum to $8.50 an hour is far from a radical proposition. Even the conservative weekly Crain’s New York Business called it “worth considering.” That’s a major tip off that, in fact, it’s too modest -- so behind the times that New York is once again about to bested by its neighbor, Connecticut.
This week, a bill was introduced in Connecticut to raise the state minimum wage to $9.75 an hour in two steps and to peg it to inflation so the increase will keep its value. If passed, the bill will promote economic growth by injecting more than $71 million each year into the state’s economy.  An increase to that level in New York would have an even larger economic impact, given the greater size of our low wage workforce.
By all means, New York should enact the $8.50 wage bill, and must insist that the minimum be linked to inflation. But we can look next door to Connecticut for a more powerful vision.  ",blog
"This week expectant parents working in Washington DC have an extra reason to celebrate: on Tuesday, the City Council passed legislation  guaranteeing eight weeks of paid time for working parents to care for new baby or adopted child, as well as paid time to recover from illness or care for sick family members. The new benefit is available to all private sector workers in the district and is funded by a small tax on businesses. A growing number of major employers are making similar moves: earlier this month, American Express and Ikea expanded their paid leave programs for employees.
With just a handful of states guaranteeing paid time for parents to care for a new child and only 14 percent of working Americans receiving paid family leave through their employers, these steps to expand access are very welcome. Today the United States is the only industrialized nation in the world that does not provide paid family leave and parents – working for every employer, in every city and state – need it badly. A new study I authored with Demos colleagues Robert Hiltonsmith and Tamara Draut, analyzes the ways that public policies and business practices like the lack of paid family leave harm parents, slashing family incomes and pushing many households into poverty.
We find that American families are trapped between the need to provide care for their children and the necessity of earning income. The crisis of care is most acute when children are too young to be in school: families with children under age 5 have significantly lower incomes and higher poverty rates than households with no children at all. For example, the drop in income associated with having a young child is $14,850 – equivalent to 14 percent of household income – for households with two adults, after controlling for other factors. Single women see an even more dramatic drop in income if they become single mothers. Yet incomes rise and poverty rates fall once the youngest child reaches kindergarten age and universal schooling is available to help families meet childcare obligations. When society finally takes a modicum of responsibility for the next generation, families flourish.
As Elissa Strauss notes in Slate, child care and paid family leave and other supports for working families need to be seen as universal rights, “indispensable aspect[s] of a functioning society like schools or safe roads.” This is precisely the case that our report, “The Parent Trap”  aims to support.",blog
"Today, with health coverage for maternity care threatened, child care costs outstripping the price of college tuition, and  nearly a quarter of new mothers forced to return to work two weeks or less after giving birth, we are making it extraordinarily difficult for anyone but the very wealthy to be a mother at all.",media
"When employers check credit as part of their hiring it creates a vicious cycle: out-of-work Americans can’t pay down their debts because they don’t have a job, but they can’t get a job because would-be employers hold their consumer credit history against them.  
The practice becomes even more untenable as you consider that credit checks in hiring have a discriminatory impact on people of color  and that a major credit reporting corporation has even admitted that they lack evidence that credit reports reveal anything about job performance or likelihood to commit crime. And then there are the errors: a study by the Federal Trade Commission this year found that 21 percent of consumers had a material error on a credit report, with unpredictable effects on hiring.
Faced with a discriminatory practice that locks qualified workers out of a job, a growing number of states and cities are taking action to restrict employment credit checks, minimize their use, and even ban the practice entirely. Last month, Nevada became the tenth state to restrict employment credit checks. Yet the state laws are riddled with unjustified exemptions, allowing employers to continue screening job applicants with discriminatory credit checks for many positions despite a lack of evidence that credit history is relevant to the job.  As the New York Times pointed out in an editorial last year, “laws still need to be tightened and exemptions narrowed.”
That’s why the truly noteworthy legislative action is in New York, where this week the State Assembly passed one of the nation’s strongest bills on employment credit checks.
The New York legislation is straightforward: as the bill’s sponsor, Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz, explains, it “would prohibit the use of consumer credit reports in determining whether or not to hire somebody.” There are no unjustified exemptions. New York State’s legislation,  along with a similarly strong bill pending in the New York City Council, is a model for the nation.  Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver underscored the economic benefits, noting that “this legislation protects New Yorkers seeking employment or advancement in their career by allowing their qualifications and experience to be the deciding factor, not their credit history. Doing so can only have a positive effect on our communities and our state's economy."" Now the State Senate and Governor Cuomo must recognize these benefits and turn the model bill into the model law.  ",blog
"Dear Ms. Evangelista:
Dēmos writes to submit comments on the proposed regulations regarding family leave benefits coverage. We thank you for the opportunity to comment on these proposed regulations.
Dēmos is a public policy organization working for an America where we all have an equal say in our democracy and an equal chance in our economy. Paid family leave is critical to ensuring an equal chance in our economy for all working New Yorkers. We know how important a strong paid family leave program will be in our state because Dēmos’ research finds that 6.4 million working New Yorkers do not currently receive any paid family leave through their employers. 
Community rating (11 NYCRR §§ 363.1-363.4) 
We strongly support the Department’s decision, as set out in the proposed regulations, to require all family leave benefits coverage issued under the law be community rated. Consistent with the goals of the paid family leave statute, community rating will ensure fair treatment for all employees and prevent discrimination on the basis of age, sex, or any other demographic feature. Furthermore, because use or expected use of benefits cannot be taken into account in setting premiums, community rating will remove any possible incentive for employers to discourage or interfere with workers’ use of paid family leave benefits out of fear of rising costs. 
Similarly, we are extremely glad to see the Department’s commitment to setting community rates in a manner that differentiates among workers based on their income. Because, by law, workers are responsible for the full costs of paid family leave coverage, it is critically important that these rates do not impose an undue financial burden on workers, especially those with limited incomes. Paid family leave benefits are set as a proportion of workers’ incomes, meaning that a worker who earns less will receive less money in benefits than a worker who earns more. Therefore, it is both logical and fair that insurers ought to charge less to cover workers whose benefits cost less.
Maximum employee contribution (11 NYCRR § 363.7)
Under the paid family leave law, one of the most important responsibilities entrusted to the Department is setting the maximum employee contribution to pay for benefits. The current proposed regulation provides no guidance into how this crucial decision will be made beyond the general parameters in the statute. We urge the Department to offer additional clarification.
Furthermore, the Department should specify how the strong principles set forth in the proposed community ratings regulations will affect the amounts withheld from worker paychecks. This should include stating that employers may only withhold from an employee’s paycheck the actual cost of acquiring of coverage for that employee, if such costs are lower than the maximum contribution set by the Department.
We appreciate the opportunity to submit these comments, and we hope you will give them consideration in your efforts to ensure that the New York paid family leave law is implemented effectively and clearly.
Sincerely,
Amy Traub

"“It's just dumb to approach retirement with a bunch of credit-card debt.” 
That’s the response of one personal finance expert to a recent Demos study on older Americans and credit card debt. My research found that among low- and middle-income Americans carrying credit card debt, a third of households headed by someone age 50 or older used credit cards to pay for basic living expenses such as rent, mortgage payments, groceries, or utilities because they didn’t have enough money in their checking or savings accounts to cover these costs. Half of those in our sample carried medical expenses on their credit cards; a quarter report that loss of a job contributed to their credit card debt. 
To me these findings – and our other research on credit card debt – had clear political implications. We shouldn’t be contemplating cuts to Social Security and Medicare benefits when many Americans on the cusp of retirement are already taking on debt to make ends meet.",blog
"If you’re planning to take out a car loan or apply for a home mortgage, you probably won’t be surprised that prospective lenders want to take a look at your credit report. After all, the ostensible intent of the credit reporting system is to use your past credit history to help lenders predict how likely you’ll be to pay back a new loan. But events become stranger once you’ve bought the car or house and need to insure your new property. Chances are, the insurance company wants to pry into your credit history as well. The result? If you’ve had difficulty paying bills on time, you’re likely to be paying more for home and auto insurance.
 Insurance companies’ use of credit reports is one part of the “mission creep” of credit information I describe in the recent Demos report “Discrediting America.”  Once purely the province of lenders, for-profit credit reporting agencies like Experian and TransUnion have marketed the use of credit information for a wide range of other purposes, from employment decisions to how patients are asked to pay for medical care at the hospital. It turns out insurance companies are also in on the game.
Insurers justify the use of credit screening for insurance purposes by pointing to internal industry data showing that, on average, people with lower scores are more likely to make an insurance claim. The problem is, they don’t have a convincing explanation for why people with poor credit tend to make more claims. If it was simply the case that people who are reckless with credit cards are also reckless drivers, we might not have cause for concern. But the industry has not been able to rule out the fact that this correlation is the result of “a factor that is not the fault of the consumer, or a factor that we as a society would want to ban as a justification for provision of service—such as race or income.”
If a correlation does indeed exist between credit scores and loss experience, consumer advocates point out that this may be due to disparities in wealth between individuals with high credit scores and those with lower scores.  Research has shown that upper income consumers have higher credit scores than low-and moderate-income consumers. Accordingly, as Chi Chi Wu of the National Consumer Law Project, and Birny Birnbaum of the Center for Economic Justice, point out in their report on credit screening and insurance:
Consumers with lower incomes and lower scores simply may have fewer financial resources, and thus be more likely to file a claim rather than “eating” the loss. For example, a Texas study found that while credit scores were related to loss experience, the correlation was due to a higher frequency of claims for low scorers, not a greater dollar amount per claim. This suggests that to the extent there is a correlation, it is because low scoring consumers are more likely to file claims, not because they actually sustain greater losses.
Whatever the mechanism, the result is that people with less money are likely to face higher costs for insurance. This gets to the heart of what is so disturbing about credit reporting mission creep in the insurance context or anywhere else: relying on credit reporting for such a broad array of economic decisions threatens to multiply and magnify existing inequalities, whether they originally stem from gender, race or ethnicity, economic status or anything else. This, as Roosevelt Institute fellow Mike Konzcal argues “is something to be fought tooth-and-nail.”",blog
"The credit reporting industry has a profound and growing impact on Americans' economic lives—from whether you can rent an apartment to how much your car loan costs to whether you get hired for a job—yet the entire system falls dangerously short on basic goals of fairness and accuracy. That was the conclusion of Demos’ 2011 foundational study on credit reporting and we called for urgent reforms.
Last week, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) delivered some crucial industry advances, improving the process for fixing errors in credit reports and encouraging credit card companies to make credit scores more accessible and transparent. Alongside other advocates, Demos called for both reforms in our 2011 paper—and they will make the credit reporting system appreciably more fair to consumers. Now if only congressional Republicans would stop trying to destroy the CFPB.
First, consider the CFPB’s big new improvements to the way credit reporting companies handle disputes, such as consumers arguing that a debt appearing on their credit report was not actually theirs. As the National Consumer Law Center extensively detailed in their report “Automated Injustice,” the credit bureaus use a fully mechanized system that includes only a perfunctory automated investigation of errors that consumers are trying to fix, with no independent review. Even if consumers send supporting documents, like account statements, to substantiate their claim of credit reporting error, the credit bureaus reduce everything to a three-digit code. In the words of CFPB Director Richard Cordray as he announced changes last week: “This is completely unacceptable.”
Consumers are often in the best position to explain why a particular account or item in a file is inaccurate. They should have a full chance to explain their disputes to furnishers [the companies with whom the consumer allegedly has a debt]. But they lose this opportunity when the credit reporting companies do not forward consumer-supplied documents.
 
Last fall, we announced that the three major credit reporting companies had agreed to upgrade [the automated system] to correct these problems… today we are pleased to update you with further enhancements... Now consumers can upload documents whenever they file a credit dispute online, and furnishers will have direct access to those documents.
 
These changes will make it easier and more convenient for consumers to support their claims. They will also make it more feasible for companies to investigate fully and address the actual details in context. The result should be more disputes being resolved correctly, leading to credit reports that more accurately reflect the current facts about consumers’ credit histories.
 
Moreover, in September 2013, we put furnishers on notice that they are responsible for following the law by investigating consumer disputes, correcting inaccurate information, and sharing the corrected information with the credit reporting companies. We expressly informed furnishers that they are to have reasonable systems and technology in place to receive and process notices of disputes and information about disputes – including any relevant documentation that is forwarded to them by the credit reporting companies.
The result should be a big step for credit reporting accuracy—no small matter when, as the Federal Trade Commission recently found, 21 percent of consumers have a material error on a credit report from one of three major credit reporting companies.
Meanwhile, the CFPB’s other step, working to sway the nation’s largest credit card companies to make commonly-used credit scores freely available to their customers, will enable consumers to be better informed about a widely used metric crafted entirely using personal information about them—but which, until recently, consumers always had to pay to access.
But increased fairness in consumer financial marketplace is unfortunately a controversial mission. Just as the CFPB was announcing credit reporting reforms, the Republican majority in the U.S. House of Representatives was voting to undermine the CFPB. The legislation, a package of bills designed to eviscerate the consumer protection agency, comes at the CFPB from all directions, from its jurisdictional authority to its funding and independence.
By weakening the consumer watchdog, the bill would make it easier for Wall Street and other financial industry players to cheat and deceive consumers, effectively strengthening the worst elements of the financial industry. Happily, the Senate will not pass the legislation and the President will not sign it. But it’s troubling that effective consumer financial protection, from returning millions to defrauded Americans to enabling people to fix errors in their credit reports, has become a partisan issue. The recent credit reporting improvements only serve to illustrate how much we need a strong and independent CFPB.",blog
"In the waning days of 2015, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced bold plans to extend paid parental leave to 20,000 municipal employees. The initiative will certainly aid city workers and their families, who will now have time to bond with a new child without giving up a paycheck. As I argued at the time, the mayor’s action could have far broader benefits—if it inspires more momentum for change at the state and national level.
Just two weeks later, that momentum is already building.  
According to the New York Post, Governor Andrew Cuomo is now considering a plan to extend 12 weeks of paid leave to all working New Yorkers statewide. The move is key because state law can go far beyond what New York City alone can accomplish. And the timing, building on the women’s equality agenda New York enacted last year, and the unanimous support for paid family leave by Democratic presidential candidates, is ideal.
Building a comprehensive paid leave system should form a core part of Governor Cuomo’s 2016 agenda—and like the other ambitious elements of that agenda, the governor should go big.
The need is great: just 12 percent of employees nationwide get paid leave through their employers. As a result, new parents too often return to work far sooner than is healthy for themselves or their children. New Yorkers caring for ailing loved ones too often lose jobs as they struggle to balance competing demands.
To fix the mess and make New York a progressive leader, Governor Cuomo should lend his weight to the powerful bill that has already passed the State Assembly numerous times and stalled in State Senate. The legislation builds on the state’s existing Temporary Disability Insurance system to provide up to 12 weeks of paid leave to care for a new child, a seriously ill family member or to deal with needs related to a family member’s military service or deployment. Crucially, the legislation also raises dismally low disability benefit levels, so that employees on leave are paid 2/3 of their average weekly wage up to a capped amount. This will ensure that employees who qualify for leave can afford to take it.
The plan, based on models that are already working successfully in California, Rhode Island, and New Jersey, adds nothing to the state budget because it is funded by employees themselves through a small payroll deduction of 45 cents a week in the first year. Additional details are available in a brief from the Community Service Society of New York. If the governor aims to introduce his own new legislation, he must ensure that it is at least as strong as the bill already on the table.
In throwing his support behind the Fight for $15—first with wage board for fast food workers, then by raising wages for employees of New York’s state university system,  and now by pushing to make New York the first state in the nation to enact a $15 minimum wage for all workers—the governor acted decisively. He proposed incremental but ultimately far-reaching proposals that will greatly improve the well-being of working New Yorkers and their families. The same big vision and a sense of purpose is needed on paid family leave.
While the bitter rivalry between New York’s mayor and governor has been a poisonous distraction from the work of governing, we all might benefit from a competition to genuinely serve the needs of New Yorkers working too long for too little pay and too little time for family at even the most important moments in life.",blog
"Over the last decade, an increasing number of cities and states passed laws limiting the use of credit checks in hiring, promotion, and firing. These laws have been motivated by the reality that personal credit history is not relevant to employment and that employment credit checks prevent otherwise qualified workers with flawed credit from finding jobs, and that unemployed workers and historically disadvantaged groups, including people of color, are disproportionately harmed by credit checks. Our new report, “Bad Credit Shouldn’t Block Employment” shows that credit check laws work, but also finds that there’s far more to be done. Further, New York City’s recent, comprehensive law offers the best legislation on the books for other states to follow – and improve on.",media
"How would guaranteeing all working people in Philadelphia the right to earn paid sick leave impact the city's economy?
The human reasons to ensure that all working Philadelphians are able to care for themselves and their ill loved ones are tremendously compelling.
The public health rationale for enabling people with contagious diseases to stay home and avoid spreading it is impeccable.
But in an era of high unemployment, good policymaking also requires that we answer another question: how would guaranteeing all working people in Philadelphia the right to earn paid sick leave impact the city’s economy?
To answer this question, I conducted a study analyzing Philadelphians’ access to paid sick leave and projecting the impact of a paid sick leave guarantee on Philadelphia’s economy. I found that guaranteeing paid sick leave will not impact employment or business growth in Philadelphia.  In the three years since San Francisco implemented its paid sick leave law, job growth there has consistently been higher than in neighboring counties without such a law, despite the nation’s deep recession.
Indeed, a growing body of research finds little evidence to support the argument that that job growth or business growth has been harmed by establishing paid sick leave as a standard. Instead, the policy provides a meaningful benefit to workers while improving public health and workplace productivity.",media
"This Halloween, Donald Trump’s “friend of the working man” costume is getting increasingly threadbare. While the purported billionaire has long tried to masquerade as an ally of the little guy—a champion of ordinary American workers and consumers overlooked by Washington—the substance of his actual policies offer far more nasty tricks than treats. From his sabotage of the nation’s health care system to a rollback of chemical safety and workplace safety rules, Trump stands squarely against the interests of the ordinary American. He has made it easier for for-profit colleges to scam students, for health plans to scam patients, for retirement advisors to scam workers saving for their golden years and for nursing homes to scam and abuse elderly residents. Now he stands poised to sign legislation making it harder for Americans to hold big banks accountable for scamming their customers.
The masquerade continues: Trump is ludicrously trying to sell a massive corporate tax cut as a sure-fire way to raise pay for ordinary workers. Meanwhile, his administration is needlessly reevaluating a powerful Obama-era regulation that would actually raise workers’ pay by enabling millions of Americans working long hours to be compensated for their overtime.
With corporations already sitting on trillions of dollars in un-invested profits, the idea that further tax cuts will spur $4,000 wage increases for front-line employees defies belief—as a rule, corporations only raise pay when they’re forced to (by the law, by worker demands, or by a tight labor market that makes it hard to attract and retain a cheaper workforce).
In contrast, revised overtime pay rules would mandate a pay increase, benefitting 12.5 million workers and their families by broadening the pool of workers eligible for overtime pay. This would both increase the pay many salaried employees receive for working long hours, and enable others to work fewer hours for the same pay (potentially cutting child care costs and other expenses of long work days). According to an analysis by the Department of Labor, the overtime rule would result in an average annual increase in pay of $1.2 billion per year. Since women, people of color, and younger workers are the most likely to work in moderately-paid salaried jobs, these workers would experience the greatest gains.
This week, the Trump administration appealed a district court ruling that had prevented the overtime rules from going into effect—not because Trump or his Labor Secretary want to save these critical regulations, but because they want to preserve the Department of Labor’s power and authority even as they water down the rules. If Trump really cared about raising pay or standing with working people, fighting for strong overtime rules is just one avenue he could pursue. Yet this was never the goal in the first place.
The cheap masks disguising Trump and the Republicans pushing forward an anti-worker agenda in Congress are starting to fall apart. Even Trump’s frantic use of strategic racism and xenophobia—from verbally attacking black athletes and members of Congress to yanking protections from Dreamers and repeatedly attempting to ban Muslim refugees—is no longer enough to check the declining support among his base. At long last, Trump’s supporters may be growing tired of being tricked.

"After two years of working in a temporary job as customer-service representative, Debra Banks was offered the job permanently. She was sent a hire letter, set a start date, and confirmed her new salary. But there was a hitch: To get the job, Banks had to undergo a credit check.
They wouldn't be strict, a company representative assured her; after all, Banks had already worked at the firm for two years and consistently received high praise for her work. But when the credit report came back showing unpaid bills from a recent hospitalization, the company rescinded the offer. Her contact at the staffing agency told her the bad credit report was to blame.
Banks returned to temp work, only to yet again be denied a permanent job because of her credit history. Then she was laid-off from the temp position as well. ""It made me feel worthless as a person,"" Banks confesses. ""Unfortunately my credit has not improved ... I haven't been able to get a job to improve it.""
Banks's case is hardly an isolated one. Today, six in ten employers say that they check the credit histories of some or all prospective employees before making final hiring decisions. This traps many jobseekers in what workplace advocate Nat Lippert describes as a devastating catch-22: They can't attain employment because of poor credit, yet they can't pay off bills and improve their credit without income from a job.
A growing number of states are also taking action to restrict the use of credit checks in employment. Hawaii, Illinois, Oregon, Washington, Maryland and Connecticut have passed legislation limiting the use of credit checks in hiring, firing, and promotions. More than 20 other states, including California, New York and Tennessee are considering bills. The moves are, in part, to help good employees like Banks get jobs they deserve, but also address a more fundamental problem: There's no real evidence that the practice is good for employers, either.",media
"The nation is experiencing a crisis of care. Across the country, parents are trapped in an economic bind without paid leave or affordable child care, even as older Americans and people with disabilities contend with their own unmet needs for care. At the same time, we face a desperate need for good jobs. While unemployment has fallen, millions of working people still struggle to make ends meet with low wages, precarious work schedules, and a lack of basic benefits and job security. A well-designed set of investments in the caring economy could address both the critical need for care and the equally critical need for good jobs.
 A thorough new study from Nina Dastur, Indivar Dutta-Gupta and their research team at the Georgetown Center on Poverty and Inequality proposes a design for investment in the caring economy and details its multiple benefits: boosting the national economy, generating good jobs, raising the quality of caregiving jobs that currently exist, and improving the wellbeing of those receiving care as well as the family members who often forgo paid employment and income to provide the care their loved ones need. This thoughtful proposal is a sharp contrast to the recklessly slashed budgets and window-dressing paid leave proposal of the Trump administration.
The Georgetown proposal on “Building the Caring Economy” includes:
 Across the nation, caregivers are disproportionately female, and the caregiving workforce is largely made up of women of color and immigrant women. Their work is crucial to our society and our economy, yet is systematically underpaid and undervalued, producing the crisis of care and contributing to the crisis of good jobs we confront today. The Georgetown researchers’ proposal for substantial public investment in the caring economy—focused on caregiving workers, families, and the wellbeing of children and adults receiving care—is a welcome addition to the national conversation.  ",blog
"If you thought credit card debt was mostly a young person's problem, think again. In 2012, Americans age 50 and older actually owed more on their credit cards, on average, than younger people in low- and middle-income households carrying credit card debt.

And while our sample size of those age 75-plus is too small to look at their credit card spending practices with great accuracy, we find that credit card debt for those age 50 and over has a lot more to do with the ways the tough economy hit this group than any lack of financial responsibility on their part. Leading contributors to credit card debt for Americans age 50-plus include medical expenses, auto and home repairs, and job loss.
Despite the fact that Medicare provides coverage to those age 65 and up, half of those 50-plus report having medical expenses on their credit cards. In addition, half of older Americans (and a comparable proportion of younger people) say they skipped some type of recommended medical care -- failing to fill a prescription, opting not to see a doctor of visit a clinic for medical problems, or skipping medical tests, treatment, or follow-ups -- in an effort to reduce medical expenses and medical debt.
Throughout the recession, older Americans have generally enjoyed a lower unemployment rate than their younger counterparts. Yet unemployment is still a tremendous problem: those age 50-plus who do lose their jobs are, on average, out of work much longer than younger cohorts. As a result, nearly one in four of those age 50-plus say job loss has contributed to their credit card debt. More than one in seven say job loss is the biggest contributor.
The overall picture is one of precariousness, of a population turning to a high-interest ""plastic safety net"" during difficult times. This instability has especially troubling implications for the retirement security of older Americans with credit card debt. Indeed, many older Americans report that in order to pay off their credit card debt and deal with unexpected expenses, they dug into their savings -- including retirement funds that people on the cusp of retiring would soon need to live on. Others declared bankruptcy.
As budget debates rage in Washington and policymakers contemplate cuts to Social Security and Medicare, they must bear in mind the instability and tight budgets that are already driving older low- and middle-income Americans to rely on high-interest credit cards to pay the bills. No age group should have to rely on a have to rely on a ""plastic safety net"" of credit card debt to make ends meet.

"Unscrupulous financial corporations could make a whole lot more money if the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau didn’t stand in their way.
Since it opened its doors in 2011, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFBP) has stood up to credit card companies deceiving customers, mortgage lenders tricking borrowers into unsafe loans, and a host of shady debt collectors, crooked car salespeople, and avaricious bankers scheming to rip off American consumers. In fewer than six years, the federal agency has already obtained nearly $12 billion in relief for 29 million Americans mistreated by unprincipled financial companies.
It’s no wonder that some financial interests – joined by allies in Congress and the White House – would like to see the agency weakened, if not abolished.
Their latest salvo is a lawsuit filed by financial services company PHH Corporation. According to a CFPB investigation, PHH ran a 15-year scheme of illegal kickbacks to mortgage insurers, inflating costs to consumers for both home loans and mortgage insurance. The agency hit PHH with a $109 million fine.
But PHH struck back, attacking the CFPB’s authority in court. After an initial ruling upholding the CFPB’s authority, PHH appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, where a three-judge panel of conservative appointees ruled against the CFPB, attacking the agency's structure and the independence of its director. This month, PHH revealed its real agenda, calling on the Appeals Court to eliminate the CFPB.
Weighing in on PHH’s side is the Trump Administration which wants more power to clip the CFPB’s independence and remove its dedicated and highly effective leader, Richard Corday.
As the courts consider the case again, Demos is proud to stand up for the CFPB and the consumers it protects. We have joined leading civil rights and consumer organizations including Americans for Financial Reform, Public Citizen, The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, and the National Council of La Raza in a brief urging the court to maintain a strong, independent agency to protect American consumers.
Demos’ research on credit cards, credit reporting, and student loans vividly demonstrates what’s at stake in the financial marketplace and why Americans need a powerful, nonpartisan CFPB. We’ll fight to keep the financial scammers from tearing it down.",blog
"In America, employees have the right to stick together to form unions and bargain collectively. At least, we’ve got those rights on paper. In practice, many employers routinely violate rights to organize, threatening, harassing,  and illegally firing workers, whenever employees try to band together.  The nation’s largest employer, Walmart, is engaged in just such an anti-worker campaign now.
Employees are supposed to have some recourse: the National Labor Relations Board is meant to protect workers’ (and employers’) rights when it comes to organizing, but the board operates so slowly, and imposes such weak penalties that it offers little security. Employees who dare to stand up for their right to join a union can face years of unemployment when they are illegally fired, while employers face virtually no penalty for denying their employees’ basic legal rights. And today even the meager defense offered by the NLRB is under attack: after Congress repeatedly refused to approve President Obama’s appointees to the NLRB, and the President made recess appointments to ensure a functioning Board, a court ruling threw the President’s ability to make recess appointments to any executive agency into question. Unless new appointees are confirmed, the NLRB will lack enough members to function when the term of its current director expires on August 27. The right to organize could truly become a dead letter for millions of American workers.
In the midst this bleak landscape, fresh policy ideas are exceedingly welcome. So it was exciting to learn of Representative Alan Grayson’s new bill, the Worker Anti-Retaliation Act, which would enable workers to bypass the NLRB, directly suing their employer in civil court for alleged violation of the labor rights. Employees could win an injunction to reverse the retaliation and courts could impose meaningful penalties.
Reporting on the new bill inThe Nation, Josh Eidelson notes that the legislation stands virtually no chance in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, which is currently considering legislation further impeding union recognition.  But Grayson is philosophical: “It may not pass today,” he told The Nation. “It may not pass tomorrow. But it indicates the direction that we have to go in if we’re going to preserve the middle class in America.”",blog
"Say you want to buy a house or a car and you need a loan to do it. You do what every personal finance site recommends and obtain a free copy of your credit report from annualcreditreport.com.
Then, urged on by the ads from TransUnion, Equifax, or Experian – the “big three” credit reporting firms that compile the reports – you opt for not only the free report but also shell out for what the companies promise is your actual three-digit credit score. A number! Now, you may think, I know what the auto lenders and banks making mortgages really think of me. I have a sense of what rates I qualify for and what type of car or home I can afford.
There’s just one problem: the score you paid for is likely not the same one potential lenders will use to assess you.  In fact, it could be way off.
What many consumers don’t realize is that they have no single “credit score” – FICO alone has more than 49 different scoring models.  And new research from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) finds that for one in every five consumers, the score you’re buying from a credit reporting agency varies so greatly from what a lender would see – either better or worse – that the types of credit you’d qualify for would be meaningfully different.  
Worse yet, the CFPB notes, there’s no way to tell whether the score you just purchased is very similar to what lenders are looking at, varies somewhat, or is in another league altogether.  You bought a credit score, but the truth is, you don’t know jack.
The consequences for consumers could be extreme. Imagine if you qualified for prime credit, but the misleading credit score you just bought suggested that only a subprime loan was within reach. As a result, you might only apply for subprime mortgages when buying a home, and would pay hundreds or thousands of dollars in extra interest and fees. You might even face a higher probability of foreclosure due to the higher costs. Thank you, misleading credit score!
Luckily, there’s a simple solution. As I’ve pointed out before, the major credit reporting companies know quite a bit about our personal finances. Consumers should, in turn, have the right to know more about how this information is used. Specifically, they should get a look at the credit scores actually used by lenders to evaluate them. As we recommended in “Discrediting America” Demos' overview of the credit reporting industry:
Federal legislation should be passed providing individuals with the right to obtain free annual disclosure of their actual credit scores (as they can currently access their credit reports) including specialty scores used to make decisions about insurance, healthcare and other services.
The CFPB’s powerful new research reinforces the need for this legislation. There’s no reason consumers should be paying for deceptive information when we should be getting accurate data for free.",blog
"Chicago teachers themselves will say it: nobody wanted to go on strike.  But today, after ten months of fruitless efforts to negotiate a fair contract, the city’s classrooms are empty and educators are walking picket lines for the first time in 25 years.  At first glance, the strike looks like a negative outcome for everyone involved. Yet this morning a CNN.com opinion article makes a surprising case: the nation would actually be better off with more strikes.
That’s right: according to Chris Rhomberg, professor of Sociology at Fordham University, America would benefit from more disruptions of business and public services, more inconvenience, more striking workers sacrificing pay and worrying about their jobs, more rounds of tense negotiations.
And the strange truth is, he’s right. America would benefit from more strikes.
Rhomberg documents the declining number of work stoppages in America. During the 1970s, he points out, there were 289 major work stoppages a year, while in 2009 there were no more than five.  The decline in strikes has outpaced the decline in union membership numbers itself. And the waning of workers’ ultimate negotiating tool is one reason why American unions are losing power, contributing to growing inequality and -- I have argued – the decline of the American middle class.
Consider the history. The 1935 National Labor Relations Act is the bedrock of American employees’ rights to representation in the workplace. After decades of often violent labor conflict fought to emerge from subsistence wages and sweatshop conditions, the NLRA established a legal process for workers to form unions and negotiate contracts. Rhomberg notes that “the strike was a crucial part of this system: while the law was intended to reduce industrial strife, it also relied on the right to strike to protect the integrity of the bargaining process. The prospect of economic sanctions served to push both employers and employees to compromise and negotiate their way toward a peaceful agreement.”
But over time, a series of decisions by the courts and the National Labor Relations Board robbed the strike of much of its power. The Supreme Court ruled that employers could permanently replace striking workers. Reagan fired striking air traffic controllers, encouraging other employers to take a more hostile position toward unions. Other rulings continued to tip the balance of negotiating power away from working people and toward their employers. And, Rhomberg argues, as labor disputes became harder for unions to win, resorting to a strike made less sense.
As a result, working Americans lost ground. We’ve reached a place where large and highly profitable corporations pay their employees rock-bottom wages with little fear that they will organize and demand more. There are fewer good jobs and the middle class is in decline.
Yet just as political and legal decisions eroded the ability of working Americans to negotiate a fair deal on the job, new decisions could help to rebuild this power. We should rewrite our labor laws to make it easier for employees to form unions, increase penalties for violations of labor law, and facilitate agreement on a first contract. A recent Demos policy brief provides one blueprint for how to do this,  making the case that strengthening workplace rights is critical to rebuilding the middle class.
Chicago teachers don’t want to be on strike. But they do want fair pay, decent working conditions, and better public schools. A strike gives them a fighting chance to achieve them.",blog
"It’s not getting better. That’s the key finding of a new survey of low-wage workers out yesterday from the Associated Press and NORC Center for Public Affairs Research at the University of Chicago. Eighty-one percent of low-wage employees surveyed said their family’s financial situation was the same or worse than it had been four years ago, while 64 percent reported that their wages have been stagnant or declined over the past five years. The survey queried 1,606 workers earning $35,000 or less annually.
According to the survey:
Less than half of lower-wage workers agree that their employer offers good benefits (48%) or that they are paid well for their job (32%). Only 30 percent of lower-wage workers report receiving any promotion to a higher position that pays more while working for their current employer. Although the proportion of workers who have received a promotion increases with the length of time the worker has been with their employer, only 41 percent of lower-wage workers who have worked for the employer for 11 years or more report receiving a promotion to a higher position that pays more…
Many workers view their current jobs as a dead-end. Half of lower-wage workers report only a little confidence or no confidence at all that their current job will help them achieve their long-term career goals… When asked: “How much opportunity do you think there is for advancement or promotion to a higher position that pays more?,” 67 percent responded a little or no opportunity.
Not surprisingly, 71 percent of low-wage workers worry about not being able to pay their bills.
The picture of a stagnating and pessimistic low-wage workforce is bleak. Worse still: 70 percent of job growth is taking place in lower wage industries, according to University of Chicago’s Trevor Tompson.
Yet this isn’t necessarily how it has to be. In her recent study of the retail industry, one of the nation’s largest low-wage sectors, my colleague Catherine Ruetschlin found that even a modest wage increase would lift families out of poverty, boost the national economy, and still keep prices low for consumers. Employers would benefit from lower employee turnover and higher productivity.
Employers in retail and other low-wage industries could do this on their own—and yet most haven’t. So it’s a good thing that policies are falling into place, albeit very slowly, to lift standards for low-wage employees. As Demos fellow Sharon Lerner noted this week, laws to guarantee paid sick days to all workers are advancing in the cities of Portland Oregon and Philadelphia, while the Healthy Families Act  to provide paid sick leave nationally was just reintroduced in the U.S. House and Senate. In Vermont, low-wage home care workers won the opportunity to organize for better wages and benefits. New York State may be set to raise its minimum wage although the deal has serious shortcomings, including a failure to index the minimum to inflation and— most troubling—a last-minute loophole cutting low-wage tipped workers out of the increase. And back in the U.S. Congress, legislation to extend protections to part-time workers in the areas of  employer-provided health insurance, family and medical leave, and  pension plans was introduced last month.
Conservatives argue that inequality isn’t a problem, and that America’s low-wage workers actually have it pretty good.  But when we listen to low-wage workers—most of whom would warm conservative hearts by agreeing that they themselves bear most of the responsibility for getting ahead in their careers—more than two in five report that “their employer treats them like they could be easily replaced.” That loss of dignity may speak louder than the other statistics put together.",blog
"When workers at a Southern California warehouse that stores goods for Walmart walked out on strike last month,  it was no isolated incident. The company’s notoriously bottom-of-the-barrel employment practices, imposed on contractors and employees alike, are producing labor unrest up and down the supply chain.  This morning produced the most dramatic actions yet, as Josh Eidelson reported in Salon:
[Walmart] workers walked off the job at stores in Dallas, Texas; Miami, Florida; Seattle, Washington; Laurel, Maryland; and Northern, Central, and Southern California. No end date has been announced; some plan to remain on strike at least through tomorrow, when they’ll join other Walmart workers for a demonstration outside the company’s annual investor meeting in Bentonville, Arkansas… On Thursday, as first reported at Salon, southern California Walmart store workers staged a day-long walkout of their own. Organizers say over sixty workers from nine stores signed in as on strike.
Both retail strikes were organized by OUR Walmart, an association of Walmart employees that has tried to sidestep Walmart’s well-funded union-busting tactics by organizing workers without establishing itself as a formal union. OUR Walmart explained the grievances behind the strike:
 Walmart workers and community leaders have been calling on Walmart and Chairman Rob Walton to address take home pay so low that Associates are forced to rely on public programs to support their families and understaffing that is keeping workers from receiving sufficient hours and is also hurting customer service. The company has not only refused to address these concerns that are affecting 1.4 million Associates across the country, it has attempted to silence those who speak out and has retaliated against workers for raising concerns that would to help the company, workers and the community.
While Walmart’s spokesman dismissed the strike as a publicity stunt, Columbia University political scientist Dorian Warren argues that the Walmart strikes are a game-changer.   “They’ve never had a disruption in their supply chain.” Warren told Salon. “There was ‘Before,’ and there was ‘After,’ and we just crossed that line.” As I've written before, there is a powerful case to be made that strikes are an essential tool to increase workers' bargaining power and build the middle class.
Striking workers are calling on allies to sign a letter of support.",blog
"Setting a new milestone in the fight for fair pay, the New York fast food wage board today recommended a wage increase in a series of steps to $15 an hour by 2018 in New York City and by 2021 in the rest of the state. The new wage will apply to fast food businesses with 30 or more locations.
When my colleague Catherine Ruetschlin testified before the Wage Board on Long Island, she pointed out:
The fast food industry is the main driver of compensation inequality in the most disparate sector of the economy, with a CEO-to-worker pay ratio in 2013 of over 1000-to-1. The pay disparity in the fast food industry is an extreme outlier, even in an economy where inequality overall has become an increasing point of concern. The outsized ratio is largely driven by the poverty-level wages paid to the industry’s front-line workforce. It is also a prime example of the trend since the Great Recession that shows earners at the very top of the income distribution capturing all of the gains of economic growth and leaving the rest of the population behind.
But while fast food may be an extreme case, it is hardly the only industry – in New York or nationwide – where front-line workers are underpaid and inequality is metastasizing. In fact, our economy is increasingly built on job growth in the most unequal industries: a trend that concentrates more and more income at the top and makes it even more difficult for working people to share in the benefits of economic growth.
That’s why the push to raise wages won’t stop with fast food –or with New York. On Tuesday, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted to increase the local minimum wage to $15 by 2020.
Yesterday federal contract workers, including employees who serve food at Congress's own cafeterias, rallied on Capitol Hill for a Good Jobs executive order that would raise their pay and secure college bargaining rights.
And today, members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus are introducing legislation to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour for all job categories nationwide. Although the chances of a steep wage hike being enacted by the Republican-led House and Senate are slim indeed, the proposal is a sign of the movement’s growing momentum.
If fast food workers in New York can win livable pay, there’s hope for everyone earning too little to make ends meet—and for our economy as whole.",blog
"Sustaining a strong middle class – and a strong and competitive American economy – over the long term requires a foundation of robust public investment. From physical infrastructure investments in efficient roads, rail lines, seaports and airports, safe drinking water and waste systems, and reliable electrical transmission, to investment in new scientific research, 21st century energy technologies, and a financial system that successfully provides credit to small businesses, public investment lays the groundwork for private sector productivity and the private creation of solid, middle-class jobs. 
These investments produce critical public goods that the private market relies on – like a transportation system that can bring millions of workers to their jobs quickly and affordably – but would not generate on its own. Yet despite a one-time infusion of public dollars through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the nation’s long-term investment in infrastructure is inadequate. The American Society of Civil Engineers gave the nation a grade of D on the state of its physical infrastructure in 2009.1 Meanwhile the world’s other major economic powers, including China and the European Union, are making substantial national investments in transportation infrastructure, including freight facilities, ports, and high speed rail lines that will promote economic growth in the coming decades.2 With lagging resources, America risks losing ground to countries that have invested more wisely.
President Obama’s proposal to invest $60 billion in the nation’s physical infrastructure, including the creation of a national infrastructure bank to leverage public and private capital, is a powerful step in the right direction.3 His American Jobs Act reflects the nation’s long history of making prudent long-term investments even at times of debt and war. From the Erie Canal to the Interstate Highway System to the American military’s investments in the basic research and development that produced jet aviation, the internet, and the computer, the American government has historically played a critical role in making the investments that spurred private enterprise and productivity. As the bipartisan political leaders of the Building America’s Future fund note, “the infrastructure past generations built for us – and the good policy making that built it – is a key reason America became an economic superpower.”4
To continue that tradition, we propose investing 1.5 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product (about $228 billion) annually in the development and maintenance of physical infrastructure, clean energy, and providing credit to small businesses. Another critical part of the nation’s infrastructure – the schools, colleges, and training programs that produce an educated citizenry and workforce – is considered in its own section of this report. 
The American Society of Civil Engineers projects that an additional investment of $1.1 trillion over five years beyond what the nation is currently spending is needed to bring the country’s physical infrastructure up to good condition.5 We propose a new investment of $200 billion per year to both maintain and upgrade the nation’s physical infrastructure, creating nearly 5 million jobs over the next decade.6 At the same time, lifting millions of Americans into the middle class demands not just adequate investment in physical infrastructure but careful attention to where facilities are built and improved. Infrastructure – from rail lines to broadband access – can connect people in low-income communities to economic opportunity, or, in the case of public housing complexes in remote corners of a city – leave people isolated in pockets of concentrated poverty. Too often, public investments in parks and other amenities are concentrated in wealthier localities, while communities struggling to work their way into the middle class receive a disproportionate share of infrastructure burdens like a polluting power plant or waste treatment facility in their neighborhoods. Guided by principles of regional equity, areas with deficient or deteriorating infrastructure and poor access to mass transit must be targeted for priority investment.7
Broad investments in renewable energy and improved energy efficiency would produce multiple benefits for the U.S. economy and the long-term flourishing of the middle class. By laying the groundwork for a transition to a cleaner economy, renewable energy investments cut pollution, decrease the perils of climate change, reduce energy costs for households and businesses, and create millions of jobs in the transportation, construction and manufacturing sectors. But these are not benefits that can realized quickly: building a clean energy economy demands consistent levels of public investment, policies to steer private capital toward clean energy investments, and public support for technological innovation in energy efficiency and green energy. By making investments that build on the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and establishing sensible regulations like a national renewable energy standard, the government can create a market for clean technology products and services – from manufacturing hybrid buses to designing biodegradable packaging to weatherproofing services – that will ultimately sustain millions of middle-class American jobs.8 We can further promote a clean energy economy by financing the cost of investments through a carbon tax levied on fossil fuels, a policy estimated to raise $846 billion over ten years.9
Just as the nation’s physical infrastructure provides a critical foundation for the private sector to move goods, increase access to those goods for employees and customers, and a host of other functions, financial infrastructure ensures that the contemporary financial system, including deposits, credit, payments, and insurance, operates fairly and effectively. From this perspective, the recent home mortgage crisis that precipitated the Great Recession can be seen as a massive failure of the nation’s financial infrastructure.10 Since the recession and its aftermath, we have seen another malfunction of the nation’s financial infrastructure in the inability of small businesses to access credit that would enable them to expand and hire employees. A recent study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York concluded that while a lack of consumer demand was the primary factor inhibiting the recovery of America’s small businesses, constrained access to credit was also a significant impediment to small business growth and hiring.11 When the financial crisis hit, small businesses suffered the sharpest fall-off in lending since 1942 as the large banks that had come to dominate our credit markets pulled back. Without access to affordable credit, small businesses across the country laid off workers, stopped buying from suppliers, and went out of business. Despite trillions of dollars in public bailouts, the nation’s major banks have failed to keep credit flowing to America’s small businesses, preferring instead to redirect public money into more immediately profitable areas, such as securities trading and overseas operations.12
To restore the flow of credit to small companies and enable them to begin hiring again, we propose the establishment of state-level Main Street Partnership Banks modeled on the nearly 100-year-old public Bank of North Dakota (BND). By partnering with local community banks to make loans to small businesses, Main Street Partnership Banks create new jobs and spur economic growth. Even though they have less than one-third of banking assets, community banks account for more than half of small business lending13 – and small businesses have been responsible for two out of every three jobs created over the past 17 years. It works through a public investment mechanism: when North Dakotans pay their taxes, instead of being deposited into private commercial banks, the funds go to the Bank of North Dakota, which in turn reinvests in both sectors of the local economy: private and public. BND supports private banks and local business borrowers by offering “banker’s bank” services to community banks in ways that increase local lending. BND supports the public sector by saving local and state governments money through profit-sharing and financing for local infrastructure projects. In addition to generating new revenue for the state, the bank enabled North Dakota to keep credit moving to small businesses when they needed it most. BND’s business lending actually grew from 2007 to 2009 (the tightest months of the credit crisis) by 35 percent.14 The bank is also one reason North Dakota has consistently enjoyed the nation’s lowest unemployment rates throughout the recession and its aftermath.
This policy should be implemented after our temporary Public Jobs for Economic Recovery program has run its course. 
Commit to investing $200 billion per year in maintaining and upgrading the nation’s physical infrastructure, targeting areas with deficient or deteriorating infrastructure for priority investment. The infrastructure investment should include a focus on mass transit, which not only creates more jobs proportionately but also lowers transportation costs for current and aspiring middle-class families that use it. 
Invest $16 billion per year in renewable energy and improved energy efficiency. This policy design is based on the recommendations of the American Energy Innovation Council, which notes that “This is about $11 billion more than we now spend in a typical year, and will put energy research, development and deployment (RD&D) closer to (though still well short of) other technologically intensive sectors; bring U.S. investment in line with those of its trading partners and competitors; and meet the bottom-up needs of major technologies… By comparison, the United States sends $16 billion overseas for petroleum every 16 days.”15 In addition to multi-year research grants, funds should be used to:
Establish a National Energy Strategy Board, convening experts to develop a National Energy Plan with clear objectives and a course toward achieving them.
Establish and maintain centers of excellence in energy innovation, along the lines of North Carolina’s Research Triangle or the Combustion Research Facility (CRF) at Sandia National Laboratory, which concentrate public and private investment, equipment and facilities, and research expertise to develop new energy technology. 
Provide an annual grant of $1 billion to the federal Advanced Research Project Agency-Energy program to focus on high-risk, high-payoff energy technologies. 
Launch a New Energy Challenge Program to conduct large-scale demonstration projects.
Partially fund infrastructure investments through a carbon tax, estimated to raise $846 billion over ten years.
Incentivize states to create Main Street Partnership Banks modeled on the Bank of North Dakota to catalyze small business lending and invest in local projects.

"Thank you, Members of the Workforce Development Joint Budget Hearing, for the opportunity to submit testimony in support of a strong paid family leave program in New York State.  My name is Amy Traub and I am a Senior Policy Analyst at Demos. Demos is a public policy organization working for an America where we all have an equal say in our democracy and an equal chance in our economy. Paid family leave is critical to ensuring an equal chance in our economy for all working New Yorkers. 
Demos’ research finds that 6.4 million working New Yorkers do not receive any paid family leave through their employers. While some of New York’s most dynamic and deep-pocketed companies have recognized the business benefits of offering paid family leave to their employees, many companies cannot afford to finance the benefit themselves, and a majority of workers lack this critical source of support even in the industries where paid leave is most abundant. Ensuring that the next generation gets a healthy, loving start in life – and that families don’t fall into poverty as they struggle to care for one another in times of sickness – are society-wide challenges, not problems that individual families and businesses can solve on their own.
A strong paid family leave program would ensure that when workers need to be with their families to bond with a new child or care for a seriously ill family member they will be able to meet these health and family responsibilities without putting their jobs and financial stability at risk.  Adequate wage replacement is important to protect low wage workers who live paycheck to paycheck and do not have savings to fall back on.  A strong paid family leave program will:
Paid family leave must cover all workers.  A program that does not apply to smaller businesses will exclude millions of workers.  There is no financial penalty for any business under the Paid Family Leave program in the budget because it is an insurance program – workers are paid by the insurance provider when on leave, not by the employer.  The employer can use the worker’s salary to pay for any costs associated with the leave, such as increasing hours or replacements.  An insurance program where everyone participates is what makes the benefit affordable to all employers and employees.  No social insurance program excludes businesses based on size.
Workers need up to twelve weeks of leave.  According to physicians, twelve weeks of leave is the minimal time parents need to bond and care for newborns, with lasting impacts for healthy child development.  This twelve week period is also critical for breastfeeding, which provides major health benefits to both mothers and babies.  Experience in the states that have paid family leave programs – California, New Jersey, and Rhode Island – show that workers take only the time they need.  Many will not take the full twelve weeks.
A sufficient wage replacement rate (the percentage of a worker’s income the worker receives while on leave) is critical to ensure that workers receive enough income to afford to take leave.  Low-wage workers generally have little or no savings.  Receiving only half their wages while on leave is insufficient to allow them to take time off.  Under a proposal of 50% wage replacement a minimum wage worker would get just $180/week.  Low-wage workers will not be able to take this leave, even though they have paid for it.  A wage replacement rate of two-thirds will provide low-wage workers with the opportunity to access more of their wages while on leave, which will enable them to take the leave.
Workers will be unwilling to risk their jobs to take paid family leave benefits without job protection.  When workers aren’t able to take leave and then return to their job they end up on public assistance, costing taxpayers money.  Job-protected leave is especially important for keeping mothers attached to the workforce and reducing the income hit women take when they become mothers.  Analysis of the Rhode Island paid leave program shows that 40% of workers would not have taken the paid family leave benefit without the job protection that the Rhode Island program guarantees.
The benefit for Temporary Disability Insurance has been at $170 a week since 1989, this benefit is too low to protect workers from financial difficulty when they utilize it.  A meaningful increase ensures that workers can avoid financial hardship, provides parity for workers dealing with their own disability and those caring for a family member, and provides an adequate benefit for women who experience complications during pregnancy.  This benefit needs to be raised to provide the families of today access to financial stability when utilizing Temporary Disability Insurance. 
The time is now for New York to establish a strong paid family leave insurance program and we have the opportunity to do that through the FY 2016-17 budget.  I urge you to enact a program that covers all workers, provides 12 weeks of leave, provides two-thirds wage replacement, provides job protection, and raises the Temporary Disability Insurance benefit.

"43 million American workers can't take a day off work when they get sick without losing pay -- and President Obama can't change that. Although the president has urged Congress to pass paid sick days legislation, and encouraged states and cities to act in the absence of federal progress, he cannot enact these laws himself. Just yesterday, he was powerless to intervene as Senate Republicans blocked Senator Patty Murray's effort to bring the Healthy Families Act, guaranteeing workers seven sick days a year, to a vote.
When it comes to the segment of the American workforce employed by federal contractors, however, the president has greater authority. As my colleague Jenn Borchetta has explained the President has the power under the Procurement Act of 1949 to prescribe policies and directives that are in his judgment necessary to an economical and efficient system for obtaining property and services. According to a confidential draft leaked to the New York Times, the president is poised to sign an executive order requiring thousands of federal contractors and subcontractors to provide their workforce with paid sick leave.

"In America, working people have the freedom to band together with their co-workers to negotiate for a fair return on our work. We have the freedom to act together so can we speak with a more powerful voice. We have the freedom to join and form unions. Yet today, powerful interests want to take away that freedom. Corporate lobbyists have pushed federal and state-level policies deceptively named “Right to Work” laws that strip away the freedom to negotiate for a fair return on our work. These laws are designed to drain workers’ collective resources by requiring unions to provide representation to people who make no contribution to sustain the union. In essence, so-called “right to work” laws aim to silence working Americans, which causes their wages and working conditions to deteriorate, making it more difficult to sustain a family. Economists find that in states that have adopted these laws, the typical full-time worker is paid $1,500 a year less than their counterpart in a state that has not undermined workers’ rights.1 
This Demos Explainer clarifies what misleadingly named “right to work” laws do, how they silence workers’ collective voice, and what their impact has been in states that adopt them. We also explore the roots of this anti-worker policy in efforts to cut wages and solidify racial divisions among workers in the Jim Crow South. Today, as “right to work” laws are promoted in a growing number of states and in the U.S. Congress, Demos aims to ensure that elected leaders, the media, and ordinary Americans understand the true nature of this policy. 
 
So-called “right to work” laws undermine workers’ freedom to band together and form unions with the resources workers need to speak with a powerful voice. These laws are designed to drain resources from workers’ organizations by allowing people to benefit from union representation without paying for it.
Under “right to work,” unions are required to represent all employees, but are not allowed to require any type of payment in return. Over time, this weakens unions: people who pay nothing drain the union’s resources, jeopardizing its ability to advocate for employees’ interests as effectively. While it is not impossible for unions to exist and even thrive in states with “right to work” laws, the absence of a steady income from all represented employees places a significant limit on workers’ ability to speak out.
 
The Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 states that no one is required to join a union to be employed anywhere in the United States. However, when workers form a union to negotiate with their employer over wages, benefits, and conditions on the job, the union must represent everyone employed in the workplace, even workers who choose not to become union members. As a result, workers who don’t join the union still receive all the advantages of higher wages and better benefits that the union achieves through negotiation. What’s more, if a worker in a union workplace has a dispute with management, the union must use its resources to represent the worker’s case, even if that worker has decided not to join the union.
In return for the services which the union is obligated by law to provide, workers who decide not to join the union in their workplace may be required to pay a fee for union representation. These fees cannot be used for political purposes or to organize new groups of workers—they simply reimburse the union for the cost of representing a non-member. At their core, what “right to work” laws do is allow workers to avoid paying their share of the cost of representation by the union.
 
Currently 27 states have “right to work” laws on the books.2  Florida was the first state to enact such a law in 1943, followed by Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee and Virginia in 1947. Alabama, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, North Carolina, Texas, Utah and Wyoming followed over the ensuing decades. e recent anti-worker push for “right to work” has included Oklahoma (2001), Indiana and Michigan (2012), Wisconsin (2015), West Virginia (2016), and Kentucky (2017). A number of these states have also written “right to work” provisions into their state constitutions. 
 
“Right to work” laws have a direct effect on workers’ ability to sustain unions. Working people in states that enable unions to collect fees from every worker they represent are more than twice as likely to either be in a union or protected by a union contract than those in “right to work” states.3  At the same time, undercutting unions through “right to work” laws reduces workers’ ability to negotiate higher wages, better benefits, and improved working conditions.
Even workers at non-union businesses benefit when unions are strong. The presence of effective unions raises wages and job quality for workers throughout the economy, as non-unionized employers compete with unionized workplaces to attract and retain qualified workers.
A rigorous recent study from the Economic Policy Institute evaluated the impact of “right to work” by controlling for the effects of worker characteristics and state labor market conditions on wages. In “right to work” states, the median full-time worker (whether or not they are in a union) earns $1,500 a year less than their counterparts in states that allows unions to collect fees from every worker they represent.4  Workers in “right to work” states are also significantly less likely to have employer-sponsored health insurance or a pension through their job.5 
Despite proponents’ claims, there is little evidence that these laws significantly impact where firms choose to locate or the rate of business growth. For example, academic studies found no impact of “right to work” on manufacturing employment.6  Surveys of corporate executives consistently find that factors such as good infrastructure and the availability of a skilled and educated workforce outrank the relevance of “right to work” in deciding where to locate new facilities.7 
 
The Depression years of the 1930s saw a dramatic upsurge in union organizing, formalized by the passage of the National Labor Relations Act in 1935. Threatened by workers’ mobilizations, an oil industry lobbyist named Vance Muse promoted the term “right to work” in 1936 to describe restrictions on union activity. An associate of the Ku Klux Klan, Muse saw unionization not only as a threat to employers’ high rate of profitability but also to the white supremacist order of the Jim Crow South. As labor organizers sought to bring working people together across racial lines, Muse warned that without “right to work” legislation to impede union organizing, “white women and white men will be forced into organizations with black African apes whom they will have to call ‘brother’ or lose their jobs.”8  Preying on the ugliest racial enmity, Muse’s organization advanced “right to work” aggressively in the segregated South, with Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia among the first states to adopt the anti-worker laws.
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. saw the same connection between “right to work” laws and the denial of racial equity continuing to operate in the 1960s. In a successful 1964 campaign against a “right to work” ballot initiative in Oklahoma, he wrote, “In our glorious fight for civil rights, we must guard against being fooled by false slogans, such as ‘right to work.’... It provides no ‘rights’ and no ‘work.’ It is a law to rob us of our civil rights and job rights.
It is supported by Southern segregationists who are trying to keep us from achieving our Civil Rights and our right of equal job opportunity... wherever these laws have been passed, wages are lower, job opportunities are fewer, and there are no Civil Rights.”9 ",research
"Most American workers have had the legal right to join unions for 76 years. So you might not think letting people know about that right would be controversial, especially when the information is conveyed by yet another poster in the employee break room or office, next to the one that says you can’t make 14-year-olds work in coal mines and that the federal minimum wage is $7.25. But new rules that would require employers to post information about workers’ long-held rights under the National Labor Relations Act are nevertheless stirring up anger.
The Wall Street Journal describes employers as “irate” about the new rule. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce says it’s disappointed and opposed to the effort to help employees understand their rights.  The Boston Herald thinks asking for posters is a sure sign that the National Labor Relations Board is out of control.
But a quote from a management-side labor lawyer is perhaps the most telling:
""The notice does make it easier for labor to make inroads,” Doreen Davis, a partner in the labor and employment practice at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius told Bloomberg News. “It’s almost like an invitation to non-union employees to start thinking about joining unions.”
If simply reading a poster that summarizes a set of rights most employees have had since the day they joined the workforce is enough to get workers organizing, it says something pretty unfortunate about the state of the American workplace -- and the extent to which the status quo relies on ignorance. I’ll have more to say on the subject as we approach Labor Day.",blog
"“No challenge is more urgent,” President Obama said last night in his State of the Union Address, than keeping alive “the basic American promise that if you worked hard, you could do well enough to raise a family, own a home, send your kids to college, and put a little away for retirement.” That promise is the basis of the nation’s middle class, and the President was right to recognize the threat to it as “the defining issue of our time.”
As Demos has documented, the nation’s middle class is in trouble. Median income is no higher than it was a decade ago and only workers with at least a bachelor's degree earn more than their counterparts a generation ago. We face staggering inequality, a critical problem, not because Americans are envious of those who are successful, but because it offers a stark choice between continuing to devolve into “a country where a shrinking number of people do really well, while a growing number of Americans barely get by. Or… an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules,” as the President said.
President Obama defined the nation’s fundamental challenge correctly and he laid out the broad themes of a solution. As we’ve argued, 
""America's strong and vibrant middle class didn't just happen. It was built brick by brick in the decades after World War II-by the hard work of our parents and grandparents.”
Last night the President told that story in the context of his own family history, and offered a powerful case for how it was done -- and how America can do it again -- if both citizens and businesses play a constructive role, and government acts through sensible regulation:
Rules to prevent financial fraud, or toxic dumping, or faulty medical devices don't destroy the free market. They make the free market work better
forward-looking public investment:
[D]o some nation-building right here at home… support the same kind of research and innovation that led to the computer chip and the Internet; to new American jobs and new American industries.
and fair taxation:
Asking a billionaire to pay at least as much as his secretary in taxes? Most Americans would call that common sense.
It was a fitting riposte to the tired calls to slash spending that supports the fundamentals of the American competitiveness, junk the regulations keeping us safe, and promote more tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, other priorities be damned.
It’s one thing to recognize the precarious state of the nation’s middle class and identify the basic mechanisms for restoring broad-based prosperity -- it’s another to propose (and harder still, enact) policies that genuinely address the scope of the challenge. Here the President’s policy proposals, while generally meritorious, fall short of addressing the full scope of unemployment, underinvestment, and inequity of opportunity that the nation confronts. There was no large scale public jobs program to put Americans to work; no plan to break up the nation’s too-big-to-fail banks; and no effort to improve jobs for low-wage workers who -- even if the most ambitious plans for education and skill-building are achieved -- will still be working in warehouses, restaurants, retail counters and at the bed-sides of the frail and sick.   
To some extent, the modesty of the President’s concrete policies is a reflection on the stagnation of our political system. “Washington is broken,” as the President said, undermined by the corrosive influence of money in politics.  As he acknowledged, critical policies that the nation has needed for years -- from comprehensive immigration reform to a new energy policy to combat climate change -- are going nowhere in Congress. In this context, a broad vision of the nation’s basic challenge and the types of regulation, public investment, and tax reforms needed to overcome it may be what we need most.",blog
"In today’s New York Times, Paul Krugman takes on the plight of low-wage retail and fast food workers, who have seen their real wages fall almost 30 percent since 1973 even as this sector has become a larger part of our economy. During a season when Americans flood the stores for holiday shopping, Krugman asks whether anything can be done for low-wage retail and restaurant employees. Noting that many retail and fast food workers earn so little that they must rely on public assistance to supplement their wages, Krugman concludes:
Yes. We can preserve and expand food stamps, not slash the program the way Republicans want. We can make health reform work, despite right-wing efforts to undermine the program. And we can raise the minimum wage.
Krugman’s policy advice is excellent: he cites the substantial economic evidence showing that increasing the minimum wage has little or no negative influence on employment, even as it does significantly boost employee earnings. He notes that 30 million American workers—and their families—would benefit from a federal minimum wage hike to $10.10 an hour.  And he points out that increasing the Earned Income Tax Credit would complement a minimum wage hike, but cannot substitute for it. Finally, Krugman notes, raising the minimum is a policy that just might make it through Congress, given that majorities of Republicans and self-identified conservatives join Independents and Democrats in supporting a higher minimum wage.
It is vitally important that we raise the minimum wage as soon as we can. In fact, we should make sure to raise the minimum wage for tipped workers as well and to index both to inflation. The efforts to strengthen the safety net and boost the Earned Income Tax Credit are important as well. And Congress must extend federal unemployment insurance benefits so people who can’t even land low-paid work are not thrown to the wolves. But that’s still only part of the story.
The other part is what workers themselves are calling for, as they take to the picket lines and flood the streets this holiday season – not just legislation from the government but action by their employers to stop illegal intimidation and harassment of their workers and provide raises. It’s not just about government policy, but about people organizing to get a better deal in their own jobs.  
The distinction is important for several reasons. First, highly profitable employers like Walmart and McDonalds should not be permitted to hide behind policymakers, insisting that they’ll raise wages when the law obliges them to. As Demos has argued in the case of Walmart and other large retailers, these companies can afford to increase wages – and would actually see benefits from doing so – but have made a business decision to stick with the low-wage model. In the long tradition of the American labor movement, workers are standing up to demand a different business decision. In the case of fast food workers, the call is explicitly for not just a wage hike but for recognition of a union and steps toward bargaining a contract.
Another distinction is the one between charity and solidarity. We may care about retail and fast food workers because, as Krugman suggests, the holiday season is traditionally a time to “reflect on the plight of those less fortunate than oneself.” But we can also consider the impact of raising pay for low-wage workers on our economy as a whole and our own fates in the working world. As Catherine Ruetschlin and I argued in our recent brief on Walmart:
The reality is that families living in or near  poverty spend close to 100 percent of their  income just to meet their basic needs, so when they receive an extra dollar in pay, they spend it on goods or services that were out of reach before. This ongoing unmet need makes low-income households more likely to spend new earnings immediately—channeling any addition to their income right back into the economy, creating growth and jobs.
Raising pay for low-wage workers improves the economy for all of us, whether we feel charitably inclined or not.  And when low-wage workers stand up to demand a better deal, the answer is not just an increase in the minimum wage and strengthening of the safety net, but respect for workers’ own efforts to get a better deal from their employers.",blog
"With anti-regulatory fervor gripping Washington, it’s difficult to imagine both parties working together to enact successful public safeguards that protect Americans. But it wasn’t that long ago that strong, bipartisan majorities in both the House and Senate took action to defend consumers against predatory practices in the credit card industry. Three years ago today, President Obama signed the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act (Credit CARD Act) into law. Evidence of its effectiveness and success at saving American families money continues to roll in. 
Demos’ 2012 national survey of low- and middle-income American households who carried credit card debt for three months or more is an in-depth look at how the recession and its aftermath affected the financiallives of American households – including how the passage of major new consumer credit card protections is helping households pay down balances faster and avoid fees.
One of the Credit CARD Act’s key provisions limits unfair fees: companies are now required to provide 21 days between the time they mail a bill and when they charge a late fee. The number of households who reported paying late fees on their credit cards declined dramatically: in 2008, half of households reported accruing late fees – in 2012, it was just 28 percent. Another critical provision of the law prevents unfair interest rate hikes: in 2012, 24 percent fewer households experienced an interest rate hike due to a late payment than in 2008.
Prior to the passage of the Credit CARD Act, one particularly damaging credit card practice was the imposition of over-the-limit fees. Rather than denying transactions that exceeded a consumer’s credit limit, credit card companies processed them and then charged consumers a hefty fee – whether the consumers wanted to go above their credit limit or not. Earlier government research found that the Credit CARD Act virtually eliminated over-the-limit fees. Our study finds that the elimination particularly benefitted African American and Latino households, who were more likely to report a reduction in over-the-limit fees.
Finally, the Credit CARD Act mandates that credit card companies include more information on billing statements, such as how long it would take a consumer to pay off her current credit card balance if she were to only make minimum monthly payments. One third of households say they are responding to new information included on credit card statements by paying their balances down faster. By making bigger payments, they get out of debtsooner and save money on interest.
But as successful as the Credit CARD Act has been, credit card reform alone cannot address the deeper issues related to household debt uncovered by Demos’ studies. Despite savings from the Credit CARD Act and significant household deleveraging in the wake of the financial crisis, we find that many low- and middle-income households are still relying on their credit cards to make ends meet. Forty percent of households used credit cards to pay for basic living expenses such as rent or mortgage bills, groceries, utilities, or insurance, in the past year because they did not have enough money in their checking or savings accounts, a rate comparable to 2008.
In effect, credit cards continue to serve as a self-made safety net for low- and middle-income households. In a country that still lacks a fully-functional national health care system, nearly half of indebted low- and middle-income households said medical expenses contributed to their credit card bills. When asked about the single largest contributor to their current level of credit card debt (excluding health care) more than half of households cited a safety net expense such as coping with a layoff, getting a vehicle repaired, or helping a relative pay off debt. In effect, Americans are using credit cards to make up for the inadequacy of the public safety net, and to give themselves a raise at a time when unemployment remains high and real wages are in decline.
It’s time for businesses and the government to step up to the plate, and this time we need more than credit card regulation. We should be bolstering unemployment benefits, rather than threatening to cut them back;raising the minimum wage to help the lowest-income working people make endsmeet without borrowing; and strengthening the right of workers to organize so that wages will rise. We must ensure that the implementation of the Affordable Care Act helps prevent crippling medical debt. Reforms along these lines would unquestionably be harder to enact than improved credit card regulations, but unless we strengthen the true public safety net and enable Americans to earn enough to meet their needs, American families will have no choice but to keep relying on plastic.",media
"Demos is a public policy organization working for an America where we all have an equal say in our democracy and an equal chance in our economy. We are based here in New York City. On behalf of Demos, I thank the Committee on Civil Service and Labor for this opportunity to present testimony on Intro 97-A: The Paid Sick Time Act.
Let me begin by saying something we all know: everybody gets sick. At one time or another, even the heartiest and healthiest  among us catches a nasty bug, gets an infection, or needs medical attention because of an accident. We’re human beings, and most of us also have parents or spouses or children or another loved one who depends on us in a case of medical emergency or temporary illness. Yet an estimated 1.58 million working New Yorkers cannot take a single day off work to recuperate or care for a sick loved one without missing a paycheck.[1]  The result is a more fearful and precarious labor force, just one illness away from slipping into poverty – or from slipping deeper into poverty. Is that the city we want to be?
We don’t have to be that city, if the Council finally votes on, and passes, the Paid Sick Time Act.
Paid sick time is not a pie-in-the-sky idea. It is the law in 145 countries around the world.[2] It’s now the law in the state of Connecticut, and the cities of Washington D.C., Seattle, and Portland, Oregon. It has been the law in San Francisco since 2007, which offers us a real track record to consider.  We don’t have to wonder: what will happen to happen to employment if we pass this? What will happen to small businesses? We can look at what happened when they implemented the same policy in San Francisco.
In the years since San Francisco implemented its paid sick leave law, job growth there has consistently been higher than in neighboring counties without such a law, despite the nation’s deep recession.[3] Indeed, a growing body of research finds little evidence to support the argument that that job growth or business growth has been harmed by establishing paid sick leave as a citywide standard. This is also consistent with international research, a comparative study done by the Center for Economic and Policy Research, indicating that paid sick days do not increase unemployment.[4] Instead, the policy provides a meaningful benefit to workers while improving public health and workplace productivity.
In places where paid sick leave has been implemented, there is a significant divergence between predictions of economic doom beforehand and the actual impact. For example, in San Francisco the restaurant industry trade group initially asserted that the policy would substantially increase small business costs and discourage employment. Yet now that the policy has been in place for a number of years, the Golden Gate Restaurant Association calls the law “successful” and “the best public policy for the least cost,” acknowledging that employees have not abused paid sick leave.[5] A top official at the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, another original opponent to paid sick leave, admitted that “it has not been a huge issue that we have heard from our members about… I don’t think it’s quite on the minds of employers.”[6] The Urban Institute conducted a broad survey of San Francisco businesses and came to the same conclusion, as did the Institute for Women’s Policy Research.[7]
Rather than predicting negative outcomes once again, I suggest that looking at the concrete evidence of how this policy has operated in practice is the best way to predict the impact in New York. That evidence strongly suggests that this is a successful policy, it is one that does not harm employment or the growth of small businesses.
One lesson from San Francisco is that this is a law that levels the playing field.[8] Companies want to provide paid sick days to their employees, but if their competitors aren’t providing that benefit, they find themselves at a disadvantage. This law enables employers to do the right thing. 
There is no reason to continue deferring a vote on Intro 97-A: The Paid Sick Time Act. I urge the Council to take action and approve this legislation without further delay.

"We can’t give up on building a nation where all of us have an equal voice in our democracy and an equal chance in our economy. As Demos Legal Director Chiraag Bains points out, the legal record of Trump Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh “raises grave questions about whether he will ensure the equality and dignity of all Americans, including people of color and working-class individuals.”
At this crossroads for the nation, it’s more critical than ever that working people of all races and ethnicities stand together for a more equitable America. In states across the country, we can—and must—build power and implement policies that will advance racial equality, make a concrete economic difference in the lives of all working people, and break down barriers to meaningful democratic participation and representation. That’s why Demos is releasing our new state policy briefing book, Everyone’s America.
In the face of the phony, fear-based populism used by wealthy special interests to divide, distract, and disempower working people as they rig the rules to increase their own power, Everyone’s America offers a multiracial, populist vision of a nation that truly represents all of its people—and a concrete policy agenda to inspire and activate the new American Demos to get us there.
The new state briefing book is a resource for policymakers, grassroots organizations, and community members. Building on the success of our federal briefing book, Everyone’s Economy, the state book provides 26 policy briefs summarizing the underlying problem, a range of policy solutions that can be tailored to the needs of different states, polling data on these policies, messaging guidance, and concrete examples of how the policies have succeeded in other states. We also include links to further resources from experts who specialize in the area.
Leaving behind tired debates over the primacy of race or class, Everyone’s America puts both racial equity and economic justice at the forefront, illustrating in each policy brief the ways that race and class are interconnected. As an example, for many workers of color and working women of every race, workplace laws were never fair. Today, as women and people of color make up a growing share of America’s working class, greedy corporations and their political enablers are using strategic racism to undermine support for improving job standards (like a minimum wage that reflects a basic respect for people’s real contributions on the job) that would benefit all working people. Identifying this strategy of strategic racism is an effective way to build power and political will for the policy change that polls show a majority of Americans already favor.    
Today the Supreme Court hangs in the balance. Yet whatever its fate, 2018 has tremendous potential for real change in states across the country. We are excited to offer Everyone’s America, available for free download, as a tool for making that change a reality.",blog
"One motivation for this hearing is the recent study by the Federal Trade Commission finding that one in five American consumers identified material errors on their credit reports that were substantiated by the credit reporting agencies.
While not all of these errors would affect consumer borrowing, the FTC’s research suggests that as many as 10 million Americans (five percent of consumers with credit reports) have errors in their credit reports so serious that they would likely pay more for auto loans or other credit -- or would be shut out of credit opportunities entirely. That’s a troubling statistic for borrowers, especially given the tremendous difficulty consumers face in getting errors in credit reports resolved. But the problem with credit reporting errors may be much greater than the numbers suggest because credit reports are also widely used to screen job applicants for employment.
My own recent research finds that among low- and middle-income households that are carrying credit card debt, one in four adults who are unemployed have been asked to submit to a credit check as part of a job application.
 One in ten unemployed people in our survey population say they have actually been turned down for a job due to their poor credit. This nationally representative scientific survey tells us that employment credit checks are common and that people are denied jobs because of them. I have submitted copies of my research along with my written testimony. 
The way that credit reporting errors affect lending is straightforward: you can mathematically measure how much someone’s credit score is affected by any given error. However, the impact of credit reporting errors on employment is far more difficult to assess. Unlike lenders, employers do not look at a hard number like a credit score but rather subjectively assess the credit report’s list of accounts. There is no social science evidence providing that any of the data on a personal credit report is relevant to employment, so employers are on their own, subjectively deciding how much weight they give to elements such as foreclosures, late bills, or accounts in collection. What looks significant to one employer might not seem important to another. 
The consequence is that a credit reporting mistake that is too small to make a difference in applying for a loan might nevertheless stand out to an employer and cost someone a job.
Unfortunately, the safeguards included in the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) are insufficient to protect job-seekers from credit reporting errors. Under the law, employers are required to notify job applicants before implementing a decision not to hire them based in any part on information from a credit report, but if you ask any law enforcement official with expertise in this area, they will tell you that employer compliance with this rule is nearly impossible to monitor or enforce. Many employers never tell job applicants that information in their credit report was part of the reason they were not hired. As a result, job applicants may never realize that they were not hired because of their credit report and further may not realize that their credit report contains errors.
My research suggests that even when credit reports are accurate and free of errors they are not reliable for employment purposes. We find that poor or declining credit is associated with households experiencing job loss, lacking health coverage, or having medical debt. These are factors that are largely outside an individual’s control and reveal much more about someone’s personal misfortune than their qualifications to get a job. 
We also find that in our sample Latino and particularly African American households are more likely to report having poor credit and less likely to report having good or excellent credit than white households. Our data on racial disparities is consistent with previous research.
For this reason, the use of credit checks in employment raises serious civil rights concerns. 
In conclusion, our research indicates that credit reporting errors are an even more serious problem for employment than they are for lending. We find that in our survey population employment credit checks are common and they are keeping people from getting jobs. Yet poor credit is associated with a host of factors that we don’t generally see as legitimate reasons to deny people employment such race, medical debt and household unemployment. The Dēmos study is another piece of evidence that employment credit checks are an illegitimate barrier to employment.",testimony-and-public-comment
"The conventional wisdom says that American households are deleveraging – after years of living beyond our means, Americans are finally paying down debt and getting our financial house in order.
But as Demos’ 2012 National Survey on Credit Card Debt of Low-and Middle-Income Households reveals, that’s only part of the story. In February and March 2012, Demos surveyed a nationally representative sample of 997 low- and middle-income American households who carried credit card debt for three months or more. The research builds on our previous surveys in 2005 and 2008, providing a picture of how the recession, its aftermath, and the passage of major new consumer credit card protections have impacted the financial lives of American households.

"The cut to the nation’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program going into effect today will take food away from 47.7 million Americans who need it. This includes working people whose pay isn’t enough to feed their families; out-of-work Americans still looking for a job; elderly people; people with disabilities; and 21 million children. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has an abundance of data on who the cuts will affect and how.
The cuts are shortsighted, hurtful, and -- as my colleague Mijin Cha forcefully illustrated in her post yesterday -- profoundly mean-spirited. At the same time, Demos Vice President of Policy and Outreach Heather McGhee noted on MSNBC yesterday, cuts to food stamps are harmful not only for the families affected but for the economy as a whole, since food stamps are one of our most powerful stimulus programs.
But not everyone is worried. First, there are those policymakers and their supporters hell bent on waging war on the poor. And then there are those for whom the thought of Americans with fewer meals to feed their children conjures dollar signs. Walmart, for example, is “cautious but modestly optimistic,” about the food stamp cuts’ impact on their business. “Our view,” CEO Bill Simon explained to investors,  “is that… [if] everybody's benefit is going to get cut, price will become more important. And when price is more important, we're more relevant.”  If low-income people – including many of Walmart’s own employees -- have less to eat, the nation’s largest retailer is “moderately optimistic” about the implications for profit.
I’m with Representative John Conyers, who thinks Walmart’s response “borders on the ludicrous.” In an interview with Salon journalist Josh Eidelson, the Congressman seemed incredulous: “it’s incredible to me that eating less is going to make you more economically effective. I don’t think… that kind of issue deserves a response.”",blog
"Here’s a policy idea that should be as uncontroversial as they get: America should stop doing business with chronic lawbreakers. If a company repeatedly exposes their employees to dangerous working conditions that have triggered serious OSHA penalties, we should think twice before signing another contract with that company to do work for the federal government. If a contractor can’t bother to pay the minimum wage and follow other basic employment laws, we can surely find someone else to run government call centers and carry out public construction projects.
As my colleague Robert Hiltonsmith and I argued in our report “Underwriting Bad Jobs,” we can, and should, ask a lot more of the companies we give hundreds of billions of dollars in federal government contracts to—we could be calling for all the workers keeping our nation humming to be paid enough to support their families—but at the very minimum, a record of basic responsibility abiding by the same laws that apply to every employer in the nation should be non-negotiable. And yet a new investigation by the U.S. Senate’s Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee finds extensive violations of labor law occurring right now among major government contractors.
According to the study, released today by Committee Chairman Tom Harkin, almost 30 percent of companies receiving the largest penalties for violating federal labor law are also federal contractors. The study looks at 49 contractors responsible for large-scale labor law violations who were nonetheless paid more than $81 billion in taxpayer funds in 2012. “By law,” Senator Harkin notes,  “the government is only supposed to contract with companies that it first determines to have a ‘satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics.’” Yet this law is clearly not being sufficiently enforced and monitored.
The report accounts a chilling series of preventable employee deaths resulting from legal violations which nevertheless did not prevent the employers from once again qualifying for federal contracts:
The death of a 46-year-old father of four, who was working as a washroom operator at a Cintas Corporation facility in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He was killed after being swept into an industrial dryer when he attempted to dislodge a clothes jam. The dryer continued to spin with him inside for 20 minutes at over 300 degrees. Cintas received $3.4 million in federal contracts in fiscal year 2012.
 
The death of two employees of a Mississippi shipbuilding and ship repair company owned by ST Engineering Limited, who were killed when highly flammable materials being used to prepare a tugboat for painting ignited, leading to an explosion and fire. Findings of the investigation included failure to properly ventilate a confined space and lack of a rescue service available for a confined space.ST Engineering received $1.9 million in federal contracts in fiscal year 2012.
 
The deaths of seven workers at an Anacortes, Washington refinery owned by Texas based Tesoro Corporation, who were killed when a heat exchanger ruptured and spewed vapor and liquid that exploded. The workers who died were standing near the area of the rupture specifically to attempt to stop leaks of the volatile, flammable gases in the facility which had not been inspected for 12 years prior to the rupture. Tesoro received $463million in federal contracts in fiscal year 2012.
In the New York Times coverage of the study, a series of public relations spokespeople for corporate contractors assert that they’ve cleaned up their act and really believe that safety is important. At the moment, these professions of good faith look like the most we have to rely on, given a state of affairs in which, as the Times details, “a major database on federal contractors contained no allegations of misconduct about BP related to the Deepwater Horizon and Texas City explosions” which together killed more than 26 workers and contaminated the Gulf of Mexico with oil.
But the commonsense recommendations in the new Senate report, which include Executive Orders and actions by the Department of Labor, could improve transparency and enforcement and change the game, enabling us to finally hold contractors accountable for the bare minimum: following the law.",blog
"$4.6 billion.
According to the analysis of Americans for Financial Reform, that’s the amount the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has returned to over 12 million Americans who have been harmed by the illegal, deceptive, and discriminatory practices of financial services companies. And the agency has only been around for three and half years.
For some in the financial services industry, that type of effective law enforcement is a problem.
Last week, I detailed how the National Labor Relations Board’s push to defend workers’ rights is drawing renewed opposition from industry lobbyists. The story is similar with the CFPB. Apparently being obliged to respect your employees and not rip off your customers can both cut into a profit margin.
If the problem were just sour grapes among corporate lawbreakers, the story might end there. But financial sector lobbying and campaign spending exceeded $1.2 billion for 2014 election cycle. That kind of money puts a broad rollback of Wall Street reforms squarely on the Congressional agenda, with the CFPB among the regulators on the chopping block.
With so much money in play, many aspiring law makers who might have opposed a corporate sellout never make it into office. In their new paper, The Money Chase, my Demos colleagues Adam Lioz and Karen Shanton analyze the way that the high fundraising costs to run a congressional campaign in 2014 erected serious barriers to entry for otherwise qualified candidates. One candidate profiled in their report is Kelly Westlund, who ran an uphill fight against Rep. Sean Duffy in Wisconsin’s 7th congressional district. Opposing an incumbent is often a difficult proposition, but Westlund’s campaign was all the harder due to the significant funding Duffy received from the banking and investment industries. In 2013, Duffy introduced the Consumer Financial Protection Safety and Soundness Improvement Act of 2013, a bill with a sensible-sounding name that in fact would have gutted the agency, throwing consumers to the wolves.
This week, Demos is proud to join Americans for Financial Reform and dozens of other public interest organizations sending a letter calling on members of Congress to oppose any efforts to dismantle, weaken, or change the structure of the CFPB. Congress must not place “narrow industry interests above the vital public interest in regulation of the consumer finance marketplace.” 
Yet the sheer amount of cash from the financial services industry and other corporate players makes me fear for the effectiveness of our public interest appeal to Congress. Money in politics is most assuredly a consumer finance issue.",blog
"This week, workers gathered on the steps of New York’s City Hall, singing carols to raise awareness about the problem of employment credit checks.

From positions as dog walkers to jobs doing maintenance work, retail sales, tech support and financial posts, a wide range of jobs in the five boroughs of New York require that applicants undergo a credit check to get hired. This year, the New York Post even reported on a hot dog vendor at Madison Square Garden who was fired after just two hours on the job because a credit check revealed that she had unpaid bills. Perhaps earning money to pay her debts is a reason why she applied for the job in the first place.
Reviewing job applicants’ personal credit history has never been demonstrated to produce a more honest or reliable workforce, or to reduce employee fraud of theft, yet nearly half of employers nationwide persist in checking credit as part of their hiring process. As a result, difficulty keeping up with bills has become a barrier to employment for jobseekers who are out of work, have medical debt, student loans, were victims of predatory mortgage lending or simply have errors on their credit report.  
Here’s where New York’s Mayor de Blasio, and the City Council come in. Intro 261, sponsored by Councilmembers Brad Lander and Deborah Rose, has an overwhelming majority of support on the City Council yet has been stalled for months. As Armando Chapelliquen with the New York Public Interest Research Group noted at the City Hall event, students, advocates, workers, and community leaders are tired to waiting to see action on credit discrimination and are ready to see this bill get passed that will end credit discrimination in New York City. ",blog
"Demos’ new briefing book, Everyone’s Economy, offers an economic agenda that will enable all of us to thrive. Women’s History Month is an opportunity to dig into the ways that a race-conscious, populist economic agenda must elevate women. Over the next 2 weeks, Demos will share a series of blog posts that explore different ways that policy can impact women’s economic opportunity and stability. Today we look at how child care for all would lift up women and their families.
Family comes first. That means all families should have access to affordable and high-quality choices for their children’s early care and education. Millions of American parents need child care to be able to work or go to school, while children need quality care and education to get a strong beginning in life. Yet gendered assumptions about women’s roles have prevented the nation from achieving a child care system that would give families real choices about how to combine caregiving and work.
The average cost of full-time care in child care centers for children under age 5 is $9,589 a year, higher than the average cost of in-state college tuition.
Nationwide, the average cost of full-time care in child care centers for children under age 5 is $9,589 a year, higher than the average cost of in-state college tuition. Child care rates for infants are significantly higher, and some areas of the country face much higher costs overall. As child care costs have soared in the past decade, a growing number of working and middle-class families are unable to afford the early learning and care that will enable their children to thrive. Merely accessing child care is a challenge for parents who work non-standard hours or have shifting, unpredictable schedules. Meanwhile, as many as half of American families live in areas with little or no access to quality child care at any time of day. African-American families are particularly affected by the escalating cost of child care and limited options, because they are more likely to have all parents in the workforce and fewer resources to pay for care. As a result of high costs and limited availability, many families go to extraordinary lengths in the scramble to handle work and care, working split shifts with a spouse, relying on a patchwork of family caregivers, paying huge portions of their household income for child care, dropping out of the workforce entirely, or resorting to unstable or substandard care.
The caregiving workforce is disproportionately made up of women of color and immigrant women. Their work is crucial to our society and our economy, yet is systematically underpaid and undervalued, leaving child care workers to struggle to sustain their own families.
All of us have a stake in ensuring that the next generation gets a good start in life. Policymakers should guarantee universal access to affordable, high-quality child care and preschool programs for all American families, and improve compensation and training for child care workers. The Child Care for Working Families Act, currently before Congress, would guarantee child care affordability for working families with children under age 13; improve the supply of child care, particularly for infants, children in underserved areas, and children with disabilities; raise the quality of child care by providing resources to states to help providers increase their skills, and requiring states to establish systems to measure the quality of child care providers; incentivize states to create high-quality preschool programs for 3- and 4-year olds; support family, friend, and neighbor care providers who care for children during non-traditional hours; enhance funding for Head Start programs to provide full-day, full-year programming; increase training and compensation for the child care workforce, and ensure that all child care workers are paid a living wage. The Child Care for Working Families Act would establish child care as an entitlement for millions of American families. Policymakers aiming for a genuinely universal program could discard the income cap in the bill and provide support to all families with young children.

"“Every week I would work different hours, and budgeting to make rent and cover my expenses became difficult because I didn’t know how much I would earn each month,” explains Janet, a former Tommy Hilfiger salesperson. 
She is one of 436 workers surveyed as part of a new study of the retail workforce, and her situation is common. The study, released this week by Stephanie Luce of CUNY’s Murphy Institute and Naoki Fujita at the Retail Action Project, finds that 83 percent of retail workers in New York City have no set schedule from week to week and month to month. Seventy percent only find out which days they’ll be working within a week. The practice of just-in-time scheduling, documented in a 2011 Demos study, is a prime culprit. “Workers are now competing with each other over sales, not for commission but just to ‘get on the schedule’,” the retail report explains. In such a precarious situation, arranging childcare, trying to make it to class, or scheduling around a second job become, in the words of the report, “a significant challenge.” On Twitter, New York Times reporter Steven Greenhouse put it somewhat differently “how does 1 plan a life?” 
The de facto answer from the retail industry is that no one should expect to plan a life. The primarily low-wage, no-benefits, unpredictably-scheduled retail jobs should be filled by young people working in the industry for a short time before quickly moving on to something better. Retail is a way station to ""real"" jobs, the jobs of the future. 
The reality is far different. While many retail employees are young and turnover in individual jobs is high, the study finds workers have typically been in the retail industry for four years, and many would like to make a career of it. One in three workers are trying to support a family on retail wages. Yet the opportunities for advancement and promotion that do exist are sharply limited by race and gender. And the quality of jobs paying commission -- positions that once enabled experienced retail employees to make a steady living -- have eroded substantially. As for students working retail as they put themselves through college -- a key step toward the “something better” young workers are supposed to be pursuing -- the unpredictable work schedules pose a steep barrier to making it class.
The retail industry wants it both ways: as Jack Temple argued in this space last month the National Retail  Federation asserts that it is ""moving America forward"" and driving economic recovery, yet it's also  fighting bitterly against a higher minimum wage that would help to make  these jobs more sustainable. That's particularly damaging because retail positions are the jobs of the future. Despite increases in online shopping (a practice that raises its own questions about wages and working conditions for the warehouse employees shoppers never see) retail sales jobs are projected to be among the fastest growing occupations in the U.S. By 2018, the number of Americans working frontline retail sales jobs will grow to be roughly equivalent to the population of Alabama – about 4.8 million.
Should these all be people whose lack of stability in hours and income make it impossible to plan a life?",blog
"At first, the University of Chicago economist didn’t think credit card regulation could possibly work.  “I went into the project with this sort of conventional wisdom that well-intentioned regulators would force down fees and that other fees and charges would increase in response,” explained Neale Mahoney, of Chicago’s Booth School of Business. But “the data changed our view of the world.” The verdict of Mahoney and his similarly skeptical co-authors was that the CARD Act was highly successful, saving U.S. consumers $12.6 billion per year, just from the provisions that reduced consumer fees. 
Signed into law by President Obama on May 22, 2009, the CARD Act is the kind of smart, bipartisan regulation that barely seems possible in Washington five years later. The law limited gotcha fees and rate hikes, and essentially wiped out the abusive practice of repeatedly charging over-limit fees when consumers unwittingly exceeded their credit limits. The law also set new regulations for clarity and disclosure in monthly billing statements – information that a full third of households in Demos’ 2012 Nation Survey on Credit Card Debt say moved them to pay their balances down faster. 
A 2013 study by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found similarly powerful results:
Late fees must be be reasonable and proportional to the violation of account terms, a rule resulting in a $1.5 billion decrease in fees in 2012.
Overlimit fee for transactions that put cardholders over their credit limit, saving $2.5 billion in overlimit fees since 2008.
Americans under the age of 21 can only get a credit card if they demonstrate an independent ability to repay the debt or they have a cosigner over 21. As a result, the percentage of young adults ages 18-20 that have a credit card account has dropped by half.
In short, the CARD Act made credit cards a safer and more fair consumer product. Demos is proud to have lobbied and worked to make the CARD Act a reality, drawing on our long experience of researching the impact of credit card debt on American families. But we also recognize the challenges that remain in the credit card marketplace. In our most recent study, The Debt Disparity we underscore the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s recommendations for further regulation:
Treat add-on products, such as supplementary protections and credit monitoring, with the same standards of transparency and disclosure as are required  for lines of credit, even when provided through third-party contracts. Application fees—currently excluded from the standard imposed by the CARD Act that states that fees cannot exceed 25 percent of the total credit line in the first year—would be included in the first-year calculation of fees to ensure that the ratio of costs to credit remains reasonable. Moreover, a high standard for clear disclosure related to rewards programs, grace periods, and products that defer interest for an introductory period, would complement the practices already covered by the CARD Act.
Anyone open to allowing data to “change their view of the world” should recognize the accomplishments of the CARD Act and be eager to extend that success in ways that save American households more money. ",blog
"August 7 is Black Women’s Equal Pay Day, marking the date when African-American women’s wages since January 1, 2017 finally catch up to what the typical white man was paid in calendar year 2017. This day falls more than 8 months into 2018, underscoring the harsh impacts of racial and gender inequity in the American labor market: Employers pay black women who work full-time, year-round just 63 cents for each dollar they pay to non-Hispanic white men. Black Women’s Equal Pay Day falls nearly 4 months after white Women’s Equal Pay Day (April 17), as black women are paid 84 cents to every dollar a white woman brings home. This disparity in the wages employers pay is one reflection of the systemic economic, social and political disadvantages facing African-American women—all forms of social exclusion.
Last week on this blog, I explored the ways that the higher unemployment rate for workers of color reflects social exclusion in the labor market. Black Women’s Equal Pay Day is an opportunity to consider another aspect: Social exclusion promotes the constructed notion that workers of color—and particularly black women—are less deserving of good jobs with the wages and benefits that enable working people to thrive and to sustain a family. A range of policy choices and individual decisions rooted in this idea prevent African-American women from receiving equitable pay for their work.
As I pointed out last week, middle managers and human resources directors enforce and perpetuate social exclusion in the labor market even though they did not originate these discriminatory ideas and may not be aware that they are propagating them. For example, research finds that African-American workers are more heavily scrutinized by supervisors than their white counterparts and are held to a higher standard of job performance than white workers. For black women, racial discrimination on the job is compounded by supervisors’ gendered expectations and practices that inhibit the success of women in the workplace. Discrimination on the job can include disparaging workers’ performance or abilities, offering patronizing assistance, isolating the target of discrimination, withholding key information, hazing, or assigning low-status tasks like making coffee or taking notes at meetings regardless of job responsibilities. This type of workplace harassment can target working people by gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, disability status or any of a range of characteristics—and may be most intense for workers, like black women, with multiple disadvantaged identities.
According to a recent survey, young black women report the highest rates of harassment on the job. As Katherine Giscombe of Catalyst points out, “women of color experience both racialized and sexualized harassment and assault, stemming from the historical context of their experiences [with slavery and colonialism]… From these historical roots, stereotypes of women of color were formed, which in some ways rationalized sexual violence.” In the era of #MeToo (a movement created by a black woman, organizer and activist Tarana Burke), there is increasing recognition for the role that harassment can play in pushing women out of jobs, particularly in better-paying, male-dominated occupations. This is overt social exclusion: a clear message from the harassing supervisor or coworkers that the person being harassed does not “belong” or deserve to thrive unmolested in that workplace, job, or entire occupation. While campaigns like Times Up are working to shine a light on (and provide resources to fight) harassment in industries beyond Hollywood and professional positions, including the service industry jobs where African-American women are overrepresented, black women continue to report that they face greater barriers to being heard and believed.
In the workplace, the results of this exclusionary behavior are clear: The National Women’s Law Center finds that employers pay black women less than comparably qualified white men at every level of education, whether they lack a high school diploma or have earned graduate degrees. In my previous post, I discussed how policymakers’ decisions around education, criminal justice, and financial regulation promote social exclusion in labor markets, effectively raising barriers for people of color to access good jobs. As a result of these and other barriers, including the harassment discussed above, African-American women are overrepresented in low-wage jobs and underrepresented in high-wage jobs. Yet even within these occupations, black women face further discrimination: Whatever occupation they work in, black women are typically paid less than white men in the same occupations. A lack of public support for caregiving (for example, inadequate paid family leave and child care) is an additional institutional factor limiting wage gains and career opportunities for African-American women and for women more generally.
Exclusion from “good” jobs shows up not only in lower pay for black women, but also in black workers’ reduced access to critical employment-based benefits like health care and retirement plans. While employers provided health coverage to 64 percent of non-elderly white Americans in 2016, just 46 percent of the non-elderly black population had this benefit. The divergence is a result of higher unemployment rates among African Americans as well as lower job quality. Meanwhile in 2014, only 47 percent of black workers had a retirement plan at work, compared to 53 percent of their white counterparts. Diminished access to health care and retirement benefits through an employer has a direct impact on African Americans’ ability to build wealth: Employees without health coverage (or with only a bare-bones plan) risk incurring substantial medical expenses that can drain savings. On the other side, pensions or 401(k) plans with an employer contribution offer a mechanism for employers to contribute directly to retirement savings, adding to household wealth. Lacking access to these benefits through their jobs reduces African Americans’ economic security in the immediate term and drains wealth that could fuel social mobility for future generations, laying the groundwork for continued social exclusion.
A future post in this series will explore how union membership among African-American workers has kept these disparities in pay and benefits from being even larger.",blog
"But for many, even landing a job was not enough to make ends meet: of those 5 million job openings, nearly half paid less than $15 per hour, leaving only 2.7 million that paid $15 or more per hour. And for workers able to secure only part-time employment, wages were even more inadequate: in 2014, more than one in five part-time workers wanted full-time employment but were unable to find it.
The core finding: there are not enough living wage jobs to go around. And women and people of color are especially impacted by low wages and part-time work.
At Demos, we’ve looked closely at two large, low-paying industries – retail and fast food—and we’ve found that continued economic recovery and growth will not be sufficient to produce well-paying employment. The new AJS report reaches the same conclusion, finding that the fastest growing occupations tend to pay low wages and offer part-time, often erratic and unpredictable schedules.",media
"For companies hiring staff, pitches from online security firms sound appealing enough: Running a credit check before signing up a new employee will “offer insight into an applicant’s reliability and a sense of their personal responsibility,” insists employeescreen.com.
Another security firm swears employers using credit checks will “find out what you need to know.”
It is no wonder nearly half of all employers bite. Credit checks are cheap, costing as little as $20 apiece, and what business wants to hire irresponsible, unreliable employees?
And then there are the discredited but lingering myths that even the credit-reporting companies aren’t peddling anymore: On surveys, many employers still speak as if probing job applicants’ past financial struggles serves as a crystal ball, predicting which prospective hires will steal from customers and defraud their employer.
It’s all gravy for the companies selling credit reports, which were designed as a tool for lenders but have found a lucrative new market: Anxious employers. But the evidence isn’t there.
You’d think that for a practice so prevalent in business, there’d be reams of studies showing that checking credit history is an effective way to increase the reliability and responsibility of a workforce. No such luck: Almost no research evaluates credit checks at all, and still fewer studies consider how they are actually used in hiring.
Instead, the research shows something very different. A 2013 Demos study I worked on finds that poor credit history is associated with unemployment, lack of health coverage, and heavy medical debt among middle-income households with credit card debt. Medical costs were a major contributor to debt for more than half of households with poor credit, while nearly 1 in 3 experienced a bout of extended unemployment. In many cases, the job applicant with unpaid bills isn’t irresponsible, but just needs steady employment.",media
"Chairman Harkin, Ranking Member Alexander, and Members of the HELP Committee: I greatly appreciate this opportunity to speak to you about economic security for working women, particularly the experience of women in the retail industry. My name is Amy Traub and I am a senior policy analyst at Dēmos. Dēmos is a non-partisan public policy organization working for an America where we all have an equal say in our democracy and an equal chance in our economy. Economic security for women – who make up half of America’s workforce and contribute to the incomes of a majority of American households – is an essential part of an economy where we all have an equal chance.
My testimony this afternoon will focus on women in the retail industry, a major sector of the American economy, and one that is projected to add more than a million new jobs by 2022.[i] Retail is one of the top industries employing women, and I believe that the experience of women working in retail illuminates many of the broader challenges facing women trying to earn a living throughout our economy.
Currently 7.2 million American women work in the retail industry.[ii] According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, retail salesperson is the most common occupation in the country today.[iii]  Yet the typical woman working in this job earns just $10.58 an hour: a wage that keeps a family of three near poverty, even if the employee is able to secure enough hours for full-time work.[iv]  Erratic schedules, a lack of sufficient work hours, and the scarcity of basic benefits like paid sick days contribute to making hourly retail jobs – not just for salespeople, but for cashiers, stockers, and other front-line positions – insecure jobs for American women, with serious consequences for their families and our nation as a whole.
In many cases, hourly retail jobs are insecure positions for men in the retail industry as well, but the reality is that women, who make up about half of the retail workforce (48.7%) are disproportionately represented among low-wage retail workers and among retail’s working poor. It’s also the case that in retail – as in other sectors – a substantial wage gap persists between male and female workers doing the same job: the typical female salesperson, for example, is paid four dollars less per hour than her male counterpart. Overall in sales and related occupations, women must work the equivalent of 103 days longer every year than their male co-workers doing the same job in order to bring home the same paycheck. At the same time, women still assume the majority of family care-giving responsibilities, meaning that it is disproportionately female retail employees who must juggle care for children, ill family members, and elderly parents with the rigid, unpredictable, and unstable work schedules (often with insufficient hours) that prevail for hourly workers in the retail industry. In turn, these rigid and unstable work schedules also impose extensive social costs on the nation in terms of poverty, public health, child well-being, and educational opportunities and outcomes for retail workers and their families. Low wages impose public costs as well, because families often must rely on public benefits, such as food stamps and Medicaid, to supplement women’s income from retail jobs. In effect, taxpayers are subsidizing the labor costs of the nation’s largest and most profitable retailers.
The retail industry does not have to pay low wages and offer unstable schedules. Before I go into detail about the challenges facing women in low-paid retail jobs, I want to highlight some bright spots: cases where retail offers jobs that advance the economic security of working women. For example, retail expert Zeynap Ton notes in the Harvard Business Review, “highly successful retail chains – such as QuickTrip convenience stores, Mercadona and Trader Joe’s Supermarkets, and Costco wholesale clubs – not only invest heavily in store employees but also have the lowest prices in their industries, solid financial performance, and better customer service than their competitors.”[v] The recent decision by The Gap to significantly raise pay for its 65,000 U.S. retail employees[vi] illustrates how even companies with a history of paying low wages can shift their business model to improve compensation. Even more striking are the steps recently taken by the nation’s largest retailer – Walmart – to upgrade its scheduling practices for hourly workers and improve its treatment of pregnant employees. Walmart improved scheduling and treatment of pregnant workers after years of organizing and strikes by its employees, as well as a lawsuit and shareholder resolution relating to conditions for pregnant workers.[vii] While neither The Gap nor Walmart have taken sufficient steps to offer adequately paid, sustainable jobs to the workers who make their stores profitable, their changed business strategies in the last year illustrate both a growing recognition of the inadequacy of retail jobs and the potential for retailers to improve employment conditions.
My testimony explores the challenges to women’s economic security in the retail industry in terms of wages and schedules; the public costs of the lack of economic security for women in the retail industry; and a discussion of the benefits of raising wages and improving schedules for women in the retail industry, including benefits for retailers themselves.
Challenges to women’s economic security in the retail industry
Poverty wages for women in retail
5.5 million American women were classified as working poor in 2012, and millions more live just over the poverty level.[viii] The retail industry is one of their leading employers, with 571,000 working poor women – one in every ten working poor women in the nation – employed in retail. 1.3 million women working in retail lives in poverty or near poverty (defined as within 150 percent of the poverty line). And with substantial job growth projected for the industry in the coming years, the nation can expect hundreds of thousands retail jobs that pay wages too low to support a family if wages do not rise.
Retail jobs are a critical source of income for the families of women working in this sector. Approximately 93 percent of women working year-round in the retail industry are ages 20 and above, not teens looking for extra spending money, while 36 percent of them are raising children. Whatever the household composition, retail wages provide for household necessities. Four out of ten (39.5 percent) of women workers in retail contribute at least half of their family’s total income. A large number of them – more than one in five – are the sole earner of their household. The lowest paid women in retail are even more likely to be supporting their households single-handedly.
The gender pay gap in retail is another major concern: in sales and related occupations, the typical woman is paid just 72 cents for every dollar made by the typical man. The impact of that pay gap reverberates beyond individual households to the larger economy: in 2012, lost wages to women mounted to an estimated $40.8 billion, with steep costs for female retail workers, their families, and the economy as a whole. 
Scheduling problems for women in retail
Retail employees trying to work their way out of poverty face an obstacle that goes beyond low wages: the lack of sufficient work hours and predictable, stable schedules. If retail workers cannot secure enough hours of work each week, higher wages will not be sufficient to provide a decent standard of living and will fail to lift families out of poverty. In 2012, nearly 1 in every 5 women employed in low-wage retail jobs worked part-time hours despite wanting a full-time position. Some, although officially working as full-time employees, were simply not scheduled to work full hours every week, cutting into their incomes.  These findings are consistent with the results of the CitiSales Study, a 2006 survey of more than 6,000 predominantly female employees of a large retail firm which found that 33 percent of full-time retail employees, and 43 percent of part-time employees would like to work more hours.[ix] Our analysis of Census data suggests scarcity of work hours was not limited to small retailers with few workers on the payroll: among workers at the largest retail firms – which might seem to have greater resources to offer sufficient hours to employees eager for more work – the percentage of involuntary part-time workers was even higher than at smaller companies.
The problem of inadequate and unstable hours in retail is not limited to workers officially classified as involuntary part-timers: many women trying to balance their jobs with educational pursuits, family responsibilities, additional employment, or other commitments choose to work only part time. Yet rigid, unpredictable, and unstable work schedules threaten the economic stability of full- and part-timers alike. Demos’ 2011 report, “Scheduling Hourly Workers,” documented the rise of just-in-time scheduling practices in retail and other service industries.[x] In an effort to optimize their labor costs, employers use scheduling software and measures of consumer demand such as floor traffic, sales volume, or weather conditions to match work­ers’ hours to the projected need for labor on a daily or even hourly basis. The Retail Action Project’s 2012 survey of New York City retail employees is one of the best sources of data on this growing industry practice.[xi] According to the survey, only 17 percent of New York retail workers – and 10 percent of part-timers – had a fixed work schedule.  For others, hours varied week to week or month to month, with 70 percent of workers reporting that they were notified of their schedule just a week in advance.
Without a stable and predictable work schedule, incomes fluctuate and workers cannot budget effectively. At the same time, low-income workers may lose eligibility for public benefits that supplement their incomes if they do not work the required amount of hours. Ever-shifting schedules mean working mothers cannot plan child care arrangements – meaning they may lose the opportunity to work a much needed shift (or the job itself) if they cannot arrange last-minute child care. Efforts to move into a better-paying job may also be stymied, as pursuing education or training opportunities is made more difficult, if not impossible, by ever-changing work schedules. Attempts to take a second job to make up for inadequate income in the first are similarly unfeasible. In effect, unstable and unpredictable schedules deprive women in retail of both income and opportunities to rise up.
The rigidity of retail schedules poses a related problem. If workers are scheduled for a shift they cannot work, they may face disciplinary measures and a loss of income. The problem is exacerbated by the lack of paid leave, including time off for the inevitable illness. Less than half of workers at retail trade establishments are provided with any paid sick days[xii] and it is disproportionately low-paid workers that lack this benefit. In a 2013 survey of low-wage workers in a range of industries, 14 percent of workers overall, and 19 percent of working mothers, reported having lost a job because they got sick or stayed home to care for child or parent.[xiii] For women, who still disproportionately assume the majority of family caregiving responsibilities, a lack of paid sick time and paid family leave pose particularly serious risks of income loss and job loss.
Public costs of the lack of economic security for women in the retail industry
Taxpayers subsidize retailers’ payroll
 Retail’s most obvious public cost stems from large retailers paying their employees so little that workers and their families must rely on publicly funded benefits, such as food stamps, Medicaid, and the Earned Income Tax Credit, to make ends meet. With women employed by large retailers more likely to be in low-wage jobs and more likely to be raising families, this is a key issue for women in the industry.[xiv] A recent study by Americans for Tax Fairness estimates that the nation’s largest retail employer, Walmart, receives $6.2 billion annually in taxpayer subsidies in the form of benefits that supplement its low wages.[xv] The research builds on a congressional study finding that employees at a single Walmart supercenter in Wisconsin rely on $904,542 to $1,744,590 per year in public benefits because Walmart does not pay enough to support a family.[xvi] While other retailers have not been analyzed as systematically, a review of state-level studies by Good Jobs First found that Walmart routinely leads the list of corporations whose payroll costs are subsidized by taxpayers, followed by other large retailers such as Target, Kroger, and Home Depot, as well as fast food companies, nursing homes, and meat processors.[xvii] Absent a wage increase or other policy change, the taxpayer bill for subsidizing the labor costs of the nation’s largest and most profitable retailers will continue to increase as the low-paid retail workforce grows.
The public health costs of low wages and rigid, unstable schedules in retail
A growing body of research illustrates how low wages and unstable schedules contribute to public health crises such as the obesity epidemic that impose steep public costs.[xviii] Special concerns arise for female workers when they are pregnant or their children are young. For example, pregnant employees may be unable to safely carry out typical retail tasks such a climbing ladders to bring down merchandise, lifting heavy boxes, using harsh cleaning chemicals, or even standing on their feet for prolonged periods. Yet as a recent lawsuit and shareholder resolution at Walmart vividly illustrated, some retailers refuse to accommodate pregnant workers with light duty, potentially imperiling their pregnancy, or pushing them to take unpaid leave they cannot afford.[xix] The lack of paid maternity leave is a related problem. Just 5 percent of workers in retail trade establishments are offered paid leave to care for a new baby,[xx] increasing the financial pressure on low-income mothers to return to work very soon after birth. This too has a public health consequence, as short leaves at pregnancy are associated with higher rates of infant mortality, lower birth weight babies, and shorter duration of breastfeeding.[xxi]
As children grow up, last-minute unpredictable work schedules make it difficult to set up doctor’s appointments. As noted earlier, less than half of workers in retail have access to paid sick days, increasing parents’ risk missing regular infant and childhood medical check-ups and immunizations. Because mothers are more likely to be the parent taking their children to the doctor, female workers and their families are disproportionately affected. The lack of paid sick days also increases the risk that retail workers will go to work (and their children will go to school or daycare) while sick, potentially spreading the flu or other communicable diseases to customers and contributing to outbreaks. If large retailers shifted to offer paid sick days and more stable schedules, they could contribute to significant public savings: the Institute for Women’s Policy Research calculates that 1.3 million hospital emergency department visits could be prevented in the United States each year if businesses of all kinds provided paid sick days to workers who currently lack access, reducing medical costs by $1.1 billion annually, with over $500 million in savings for public health insurance programs.[xxii]
Low wages and unstable schedules in retail block opportunity for the next generation
Beyond public health, the unpredictable and inflexible schedules associated with retail and other low-wage work hinder parents from participating in their children’s education and development, constraining opportunity for the next generation of Americans and entrenching economic inequality. No matter how much they want to, women working the unstable schedules common in the retail industry may not be regularly available to help children with homework, attend parent-teacher conferences or other school events, or otherwise have sustained involvement in their child’s education. Indeed, an analysis of the American Time Use Survey finds that low-wage women working non-standard schedules spend less time with their families – particularly with school-age children – than those working standard schedules.[xxiii] The study also notes that retail is among the top industries employing workers with non-standard schedules, defined as work before 6 a.m. or after 6 p.m. or on the weekends. Researchers at New York University examined the consequences of this time deficit, finding that low-income parents working changing shifts at non-standard hours were more likely to have children with behavior problems at school and lower school performance as reported by teachers.[xxiv]
Retail’s low wages are also an impediment to opportunity for children, with potentially devastating consequences for their future life chances. Children of low-income parents are seven times more likely to drop out of school than are higher income youth[xxv] and are far more likely to become parents in their teen years.[xxvi] Young people whose parents hold low-wage jobs are more likely to become “disconnected youth” in their post-high school years, neither working nor pursuing education or training.[xxvii] Considering the tremendous societal loss, researchers at the University of Massachusetts note, “the effects of non-high school completion are profound… lifelong income loss, diminished health, and more likely reliance on publicly-funded services results in considerable societal expense. Yet, arguably, the greatest cost to society is the loss of talents, abilities, and affiliation of millions of young people.”[xxviii]
And yet, a different path is possible. Based on his studies of low-income working parents in Milwaukee, Harvard professor Hirokazu Yoshikawa observes that “a work trajectory that's characterized by full-time work with wage growth over the period of the two years resulted in increases in children's school performance and reductions in their acting out behaviors… positive work experiences that result in increases in income over time… can help actually improve children's school success.”[xxix] By investing in stable careers for the women working in its stores, the retail industry can make a positive difference for the next generation.
Low wages and unstable schedules in retail combine with high pay at the top to fuel inequality
The US has seen a highly unbalanced economic recovery, with the nation’s highest earners pocketing nearly all of the economic growth since the Great Recession, and the top 10 percent taking home their greatest share of income in recorded history.[xxx] This growing concentration of income at the top, combined with a wave of strikes and protests by low-wage workers – including retail workers employed by Walmart – has brought renewed attention to the corrosive effects of inequality. And retail is among the most unequal sectors of the economy.
In 2012, CEOs in the retail industry earned 304 times the annual income of the average retail worker— among the highest CEO-to-worker ratios of any sector in the economy in any year since 2000.[xxxi] Over the years between 2000 and 2012, the only economic sector with greater average pay disparities than retail is accommodations and food services. And the trend is worsening: after dipping briefly during the Great Recession, pay disparities in retail have grown since 2009, nearly recovering their pre-Recession peak.  This mounting inequality has a gendered face: while women make up more than half of the retail labor force at large firms, they account for just 1.8 percent of retail CEOs in the Fortune 1000, according to Catalyst.[xxxii]
The growing inequality fueled by retail and other low-wage industries has far-reaching effects on our society. Increasingly, research shows that inequality is associated with slower economic growth and volatility, as well as social instability and declines in the quality of health and education.[xxxiii] At the same time, studies suggest that inequality undermines our democracy, as political decision-making increasingly reflects the policy preferences of major political donors with substantially different priorities than the voting public.[xxxiv] Of course, no single industry caused this damage on its own or can fix it single-handedly. Nevertheless, as the employer of one in ten working Americans – and one in ten working poor women – raising wages and improving schedules in the retail industry would be a significant step toward reducing inequality and the harms it causes throughout society.
The benefits of raising wages and improving schedules for women in the retail industry
In Demos’ forthcoming paper on women in the retail industry, we model the effects of a wage increase to $12.25 an hour (the equivalent of $25,000 a year for a full-time worker) at large retail companies. We look at costs to retailers, the price increase for consumers, and the impact on the nation’s gross domestic product and job creation. We also consider the impact of improved scheduling practices such as providing work schedules further in advance, guaranteeing workers a consistent number of hours, and giving workers opportunities to swap shifts, cross-train for different positions, or work in different store locations, ensuring that both employee and employer scheduling needs are met. While the numerical results of that study are not yet available, this section discusses the evidence for the benefits of raising wages and improving schedules for women in the retail industry.
Improving wages and schedules for women in retail would benefit the economy
Families living in or near poverty spend close to 100 percent of their income just to meet their basic needs, so when they receive an extra dollar in pay, they spend it on goods or services that were out of reach before. This ongoing need makes low-income households more likely to spend new earnings immediately – channeling any addition to their income right back into the economy. High-income households, in contrast, put a larger portion of their money into long-term investments such as retirement savings that do not factor into consumer demand.[xxxv] Because spending patterns differ widely across income groups, investments that enhance the budgets of low-income households have a greater impact on the economy than money given to those at the top. For example, the economic stimulus payments of 2008 increased spending among low-income households far more than higher earners, with a substantial portion of the new purchases going toward durable and non-durable retail goods.[xxxvi] Increasing the purchasing power of low-income households is good economic policy during a period of flagging demand. By raising the floor of large chain retail wages, these businesses can provide a private sector stimulus without depending on the government to enact the change.
The amount of economic activity generated by a wage raise is determined by what economists refer to as the multiplier. The multiplier indicates how many times a new dollar will circulate in the economy before its amplifying effects fade away. When a worker receives a raise, she will have additional money to spend – that spending becomes someone else’s new income, either the business owner where she makes a purchase or the worker at the store who gets more hours or more money when business is good. Multipliers differ depending on where the dollar appears in the economy; if low-income households have an extra dollar to spend the multiplier is higher than if that dollar goes to high income savers. So a transfer of purchasing power to low-wage workers will boost economic activity to the degree that the multiplier forecasts ripple effects across consumer spending.
In order to predict how a raise for employees at large retail firms will impact the economy, we incorporate both the positive effect of the multiplier on household spending and the potentially negative effect on the balance sheet of employers. Firms can either pay for the wage raise out of profits, pass on the cost of the additional wage bill to consumers through higher prices, or combine both tactics to cover the cost. The extent to which retail employers will place the burden of higher wages on their customers is unclear. Research on the relationship between prices and the minimum wage focuses entirely on the fast food industry and presents mixed results.[xxxvii] But there is reason to believe that firms will pass-through less than 100 percent of the cost. That is because the new minimum produces gains to the firm that offset part of the cost before either profits or consumer spending have to make up the difference.
Employers that invest in their labor force are better able to hang on to their best, most experienced workers, increasing operational efficiency and cutting down on the costs of labor turnover. The differences can be dramatic. One study from the Wharton School of Business found that a $1 increase in payroll at retailers leads to an additional $4 to $28 in sales each month, with a 25 percent rise in payroll generating 2.6 percent more in sales.[xxxviii] Revenue grows because well-paid, experienced employees are better able to provide the essential services that customers need – with knowledge of inventory, products, brands, and prices – and satisfied customers spend more money in the store.27 The benefits of the new wage floor appear on the balance sheet as profits, mitigating a part of the wage bill so that customers and firms take on only the remaining part of the cost. A raise for retail wages is an investment in the labor force, increasing productivity and translating to lower costs and higher sales for the firm, and negating a portion of the wage bill before it ever reaches consumers.
Higher wages and better schedules lead to higher sales
The reality is that large retail firms won’t have to cover the entire wage bill or cost of improving scheduling because these improvements to retail jobs have the potential to pay for themselves, at least in part. A large body of research shows that paying higher wages in the retail sector results in greater productivity and higher sales. Zeynep Ton, an expert on the retail sector at MIT, has shown that businesses that make an investment in their retail workforce find that well-paid, knowledgeable, and experienced employees can be a driver of sales, rather than costs.[xxxix] Paying for high quality workers who can answer customer requests and identify priorities meets the long term goals of the business, as opposed to simply satisfying short-term cost minimization.
Ton’s close study of retailers like Home Depot and the defunct Borders bookstore chain leads to similar conclusions about scheduling: retailers’ efforts to precisely match labor supply to consumer traffic often fall short because just-in-time scheduling strategies fuel employee turnover, absenteeism and tardiness. This means that despite sophisticated scheduling software, retailers “don’t know who will quit, who will be late tomorrow, and who just won’t bother to show up.”[xl] Finally, Ton concludes that a misguided effort to cut labor costs leads many retailers to understaff their stores, losing sales and passing up profits. Missed sales opportunities could be recaptured if, for example, retailers drew on the pool of more than one million women working part-time retail jobs who report wanting a full-time hours.
Ton’s findings are supported by other research on the performance of retail firms. For example, the CitiSales study conducted by researchers at Boston College and the University of Kentucky finds that giving retail employees more control over their work schedules optimizes recruitment among the hourly workforce, boosts retention of key talent, promotes employee productivity, engages employees, cultivates quality customer service, and reduces costs associated with turnover.[xli] Researchers have also compared Costco, a high-wage retail employer that guarantees employees a set number of hours per week, with its warehouse club rival, low-wage employer Sam’s Club, revealing a substantial payoff to paying fair wages and offering stable schedules: sales per employee at Costco are nearly double the average sales per employee at Sam’s Club.[xlii] Across the retail sector higher payroll levels and more stable schedules are associated with customer satisfaction, which translates to more money in the register. 
Conclusion
The retail industry has tremendous potential to offer good, family-sustaining jobs to the 7.8 million American women projected to work in the industry in the next decade. To realize this potential, and advance women’s economic security, retailers must raise wages and improve scheduling policies for their workforce. Recent movements toward increasing pay at the Gap and improving schedules at Walmart have been encouraging, but broad change is likely to occur only as a result of legislation. Legislation to increase the minimum wage, strengthen the Equal Pay Act, facilitate union organizing, and guarantee a minimum number of paid sick days and paid family leave would enhance the economic security of women in the retail industry and throughout the economy.  Congress should also consider the models offered by state laws on reporting pay, which compensate employees for a minimum number of hours during a work shift for which they have been scheduled.

"""Gentlemen, the Pullman Company is ready to sign."" With that concession from the company president on August 25, 1937, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters became the first black labor union to win a collective bargaining agreement with a major American corporation. After 12 years of struggle facing intense company opposition, the union of more than 8,000 African Americans working segregated jobs as train porters and maids won higher pay, shorter work hours, improved working conditions, and a critical element of respect and dignity. Saving their wages and tips, unionized porters and maids sent their children and grandchildren to college, supporting social mobility across generations.
In a recent series of blog posts, I’ve looked at the impact of social exclusion in today’s labor market and workplace, documenting how large employers and their political allies deploy the constructed notion that workers of color are less deserving than white workers of employment, and especially of good jobs with the wages and benefits that enable working people to thrive and to sustain a family. The victory of the Sleeping Car Porters 81 years ago this week demonstrates how joining together in unions has long been a powerful means of overcoming social exclusion in the workplace and thus building an inclusive economy that enables the full participation and power of black workers.
Like almost every institution in the U.S., unions themselves are struggling with a legacy of racial discrimination. Leaders of the American Federation of Labor initially refused to grant the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters an international charter, holding out until the union gained enough strength to force recognition in 1935, becoming the first black union to join the labor federation. Today, the AFL-CIO honors the history of the Sleeping Car Porters and draws much of its strength from union members of color. In 2017 more than a third of union workers were black, Asian, or Latino. Black workers are more likely than workers of any other race to be represented by a union.
Unions contribute to structural inclusion by negotiating for pay transparency, protections from discrimination and harassment, and clear processes for raises and promotions that limit opportunities for managerial bias. As a result, the Economic Policy Institute finds that hourly wages for black workers represented by unions are 14.7 percent higher than wages paid to black workers who are not in unions, after controlling for other factors. Latino workers represented by unions are paid 21.8 percent more than their nonunionized counterparts. By diminishing social exclusion in the workplace, union negotiations lift the wages of workers of color closer to those of their white counterparts (white workers also see a substantial pay boost from unionization, but it is smaller), effectively reducing racial and ethnic pay gaps. Because union representation also decreases gender pay gaps, women of color see particularly large pay benefits from unionization. Workers of color who are represented by unions also benefit from greater access to employer-provided health coverage and retirement plans, as well as paid vacation and holidays. In addition, the labor movement played a key role in supporting civil rights beyond the workplace.
As Caleb Gayle recently pointed out in The Guardian, unions helped to build the black middle class, reducing the systemic economic disadvantages faced by African-American workers. But social exclusion is not so easily defeated. In my previous post, I discussed how corporate interests have consistently manipulated racism to turn working people against each other, pushing down wages, undermining solidarity, and weakening the freedom to stand together in unions. This effort includes a political push to erode the laws that make it possible for working people to organize: The Pullman porters, for example, had tried to form a union to combat degrading workplace treatment since the 1880s. It was not until the passage of laws such as the 1935 National Labor Relations Act, which banned the Pullman Company’s worker intimidation tactics and outlawed its fake, company-controlled union, that the workers were able to gain recognition and win a contract.
Yet for decades, corporate interests and their political and judicial allies have assaulted the protections provided by the National Labor Relations Act and other pro-worker reforms. Employers have taken advantage of weak laws to restrict workers’ freedom to join together in unions. Although most Americans today have a positive view of labor unions, the percentage of working people represented by a union at work has declined substantially since the 1970s. The Supreme Court’s recent rulings in the Janus and Epic Systems cases are the latest blows to workers’ freedom. The Janus case in particular will have a strong negative effect on black women, because they are disproportionately represented in the public sector jobs where Janus undermines workers’ unions.
As Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and other civil rights leaders recognized, the freedom to join unions and work through them to advance economically has always been essential to achieving racial equity and social inclusion. King’s last campaign was a labor struggle: Just before he was assassinated, Dr. King addressed striking African-American sanitation workers in Memphis, who as King noted were paid “wages so low that they cannot begin to function in the mainstream of the economic life of our nation.” At the same time, King told the workers, “Along with wages and all of the other securities that you are struggling for, you are also struggling for the right to organize and be recognized.” It is no coincidence that when Dr. King gave his famous “I Have a Dream” speech, it was at the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom organized with A. Philip Randolph, the original leader of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters.",blog
"It’s their fifth strike in five months, but the workers of Good Jobs Nation didn’t seem the least bit tired this morning. Low-paid employees from the food courts of federal buildings, the gift shops of the Smithsonian, and others employed under federal contracts, concessions, and lease agreements donned matching t-shirts, picked up signs and marched to the White House.

Congress might be locked in endless, dismal debates about defunding health care and cutting food stamps, but President Obama—the man who recently said reversing rising inequality was his highest priority,—could sign an executive order with the potential to raise wages for 560,000 low-paid contract employees. The workers delivered a petition with 250,000 signatures calling on the President to take action. Fifteen U.S. Senators submitted their own letter, urging President Obama to use his executive authority to “require federal agencies to give major preference in awarding contracts to companies that… pay their workers decent wages and benefits.”
In May, my colleague Robert Hiltonsmith and I released a study quantifying the number of poorly-paid workers employed through federal contracts, medical payments, and other funding mechanisms. But we also recognized another element of rising inequality on the public dime: federal subsidizes for sky-high executive pay.
In a research brief released this week, we estimate that taxpayers pay an estimated $23.9 billions every year towards the pay of contracting executives and other highly compensated workers. Under current law, contractors can bill the public for as much as $760,000 per executive. If this amount were capped at an amount equivalent to the salary of the Vice President of the United States, we find that the public would save an estimated $7 billion per year. Companies could continue to pay their executives whatever exorbitant amount they chose, of course, but taxpayers would subsidize a bit less of it. 
The savings—the fruit of taxpayer subsidized inequality—could be used to offer low-paid contract workers organizing with Good Jobs Nation a far higher wage. Instead of being an engine of inequality, federal contracting could become a model of fair pay and a mechanism for greater equity.  That’s something worth marching on the White House for.",blog
"The Trump administration’s latest attack on immigrants, a proposed rule that would punish families for accessing public benefits, has rightfully come under fire for its potential to threaten children’s health and impose financial hardship on households and communities. Under the proposal, the Department of Homeland Security could block green cards and visas for lawful immigrants who use, or are considered likely to use, essential family support programs. Across the country, there is already widespread evidence that merely proposing changes to the “public charge” rule is causing fear and confusion, deterring families from accessing basic necessities such as food, housing, and health care out of fear that their future in the United States may be put at risk. Business leaders, physicians, teachers, and food bank operators are among the groups speaking out against the prospective change.
But one part of the proposal has received less attention: a bizarre plan for officials to use immigrants’ personal credit information (credit reports and scores) as part of the assessment to qualify for a green card or visa. Using an irrelevant measure like a credit score to assess immigration status is not only absurd, it puts the federal government’s stamp of approval on the growing misuse of credit information that impacts all Americans.",media
"There’s no question that Tuesday’s elections brought some significant wins for working people. I’m not talking about the candidates – although national political reporters are busy acknowledging Obama’s reelection as a clear sign that “labor ain’t dead”  and pondering the policy implications of victories for pro-worker politicians like Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown – but rather thinking about the ballot initiatives, where in several votes across the country voters spoke out clearly in favor of raising workplace standards and preserving rights on the job.
We can speculate about exactly what candidates will do once in office, but it seems certain that many working people will benefit from higher wages, improved benefits, and a right to a voice at work as a direct result of the following ballot measures:
In Albuquerque, New Mexico, 40,000 low-wage workers in will get a pay boost as voters in the city overwhelmingly cast their ballots in favor of an increase in the municipal minimum wage. In January 2013, the city’s minimum will rise from $7.50 to $8.50 per hour with automatic adjustments for inflation.  ",blog
"Good Afternoon. My name is Amy Traub and I am a senior policy analyst at Demos. We are a public policy organization working for an America where we all have an equal say in our democracy and an equal chance in our economy. I would like to thank the Progressive Caucus for this opportunity to provide testimony on our recent research.
For our report “Underwriting Bad Jobs: How Our Tax Dollars Are Funding Low-Wage Work and Fueling Inequality,” my colleague Robert Hiltonsmith and I analyzed data on federal contractors, health care spending, Small Business Administration loans, federal infrastructure grants and Public Buildings Service property leases.[1] We found that through these sources of federal funding, nearly two million private sector workers are employed, doing jobs we have decided are worthy of public funding, for wages of $12 an hour less, in some cases much less. There is no single private sector employer responsible for this many low wage employees.
The United States has a history of working to ensure that our tax dollars provide decent jobs. The Davis-Bacon Act, passed in 1931, mandates that federally contracted construction workers be paid at least the prevailing wage within a particular area for their work.[2] In 1936, the Walsh-Healey Act extended similar protections to workers manufacturing goods to be used by federal agencies, including the military.[3] The 1965 Service Contract Act further mandates that employees of federal contractors or subcontractors who provide services to federal agencies should also be covered by prevailing wage standards.[4] While these statutes continue to offer important labor protections, we find that federal prevailing wage laws have not succeeded in consistently raising wages above $12 an hour.[5]
While we did not track the growth of the publicly-funded private sector workforce over time, there are three trends we can see contributing to its current size. The first is the dramatic growth of federal contracting, which doubled between 1996 and 2009, as much work formerly performed by public employees was outsourced to private companies.[6] Second is the increase in federal health care spending through Medicare and Medicaid, which flows to the private health care system that includes many low-wage employees.[7] Third is the growth of low-wage employment in the private economy overall. Since 2001, the number of low-wage jobs created has outpaced the growth of better paying work and this trend has become worse since the recession.[8] Without an effective wage standard to protect workers funded by public dollars, their wages mirror those of the larger private economy.
Low-wage workers funded by our public dollars work in nearly every sector of the economy and in every part of the country. For example, we find 392,000 low-wage workers employed in home health care services.[9] Personal care aides, who assist the elderly or people with disabilities with daily living activities, earn a median wage of just $8.90 an hour in the home health care services industry, while home health aides, who perform routine medical duties such as changing bandages, dressing wounds, and applying medications, typically earn just $9.82.[10] In the industry as a whole, which also includes visiting nurses and other medical professionals, the median wage is only $11.70 an hour. Many low-wage workers in the home health care industry are excluded from the minimum wage and overtime laws that protect other workers, suppressing wages in the home health care industry a whole.[11] Yet two-thirds of the home health care services industry is supported by our tax dollars, primarily through Medicare and Medicaid.
We also find 60,000 low-wage retail workers supported by public dollars. Retail is not a sector we might typically think of as being federally supported, but retailers received $3.7 billion in federal contracts in 2012, supporting an estimated 45,000 jobs, of which an estimated 22,000 paid $12 an hour or less. Small Business Administration loans subsidized another 38,000 low-wage retail jobs. Retail cashiers, for example, earn a median wage of just $9.13 an hour, stock clerks earn $9.80, and the retail salespeople who make up the bulk of employees in the sector make $10.09.[12] Widespread practices of involuntary part-time work and unstable scheduling push incomes in this sector even lower.
I will discuss one more industry, which is transportation equipment manufacturing. On the whole this is not a low-wage industry, 85 percent of employees earn more than $12 an hour.[13] But with $108.6 billion in federal contracts in 2012, primarily from the military, the footprint of the federal government in this industry is so large that we still find 35,000 federally-funded workers across the country who earn low wages. It’s worth noting that this industry is largely in business as a result of taxpayer dollars: in 2012, aerospace manufacturing received 49 percent of its revenue from federal contracting, while boat and ship builders collected 57 percent of their revenue from federal contracts.
I have referred to home health care, retail, and transportation equipment manufacturing to suggest the diversity of industries and sectors that include low-wage jobs funded by federal dollars. This is just a small sample of the industries impacted. The low-wage federally-funded private sector workforce includes Americans from every region of the country, of every race, and draws from the entire working-age population.
In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that when federally funded workers are paid low wages, taxpayers are, in effect, subsidizing their jobs twice. First we pay for the work itself. But we pay again when workers earn so little that they require public benefits, such as Medicaid, food stamps, and housing assistance, to support their families.  The existence of this double subsidy suggests that raising wages for these workers would be more cost-effective than it might appear. In addition, evidence on the impact of local living wage laws and economic development agreements that incorporate job standards indicates that the cost to taxpayers does not rise dramatically when workers are paid decent wages. 
Thank you for your time. I would be pleased to answer any questions.

"As Democratic candidates for President debate on Tuesday night, they are sure to grapple with the grim situation facing Americans at work. Although unemployment is falling, wages are frozen. Many jobs demand ever-changing schedules that leave little opportunity for planning a life. Workers are disrespected, and obliged to work in unsafe conditions. Even professional employees and the most highly-educated workers increasingly confront sweatshop-like conditions.
These facts are clear. Yet the candidates must also acknowledge that the swelling tide of workplace woe can be traced back to a single source: working people don’t have much of a voice on the job, or in the economy as a whole.
President Obama‘s “Summit on Worker Voice” last week brought these concerns to the forefront. On one level, the President urged working Americans to use their voices to start conversations with coworkers about the changes they’d like to see on the job.(“A voice at the lunch table,” says a recent video from the Department of Labor “can lead to a voice at the bargaining table”)  On another level, the President made it clear that institutional changes are necessary in order for working people to be effective in exercising their voice on a truly meaningful scale: the nation needs to strengthen labor laws and make it easier for Americans to join unions. [Full employment – a topic for another day! – is also crucial.]
Indeed, a new brief from the President’s Council of Economic Advisors documents how unions continue to deliver higher wages and better benefits for their members, contribute to workplace safety, and also improve the jobs of non-union workers. Other research details how the decades-long decline in union membership has contributed to skyrocketing inequality. At a time of growing public support for labor unions particularly among workers who are paid low wages, policies that enable people to organize without fear of retaliation could make a substantial difference in the employment landscape.
Candidates taking the debate state on Tuesday will find no shortage of policy ideas.
Last month, Senator Patty Murray and Rep. Bobby Scott introduced the Workplace Action for a Growing Economy (WAGE) Act, which would strengthen penalties against employers who illegally retaliate against workers who act collectively, whether it is to form a union or to win any other improvement at work. The bill would impose monetary penalties on employers who violate workers’ right to organize; require employers to pay victims three times the amount of back pay;  and authorize personal liability for responsible corporate officers. Significantly, the legislation would also hold employers jointly liable for violations committed against temporary or contract employees, and would ensure that workers receive remedies regardless of their immigration status.
And last week, Senator (and Presidential hopeful) Bernie Sanders joined Reps. Pocan and Norcross to introduce The Workplace Democracy Act, which would make it easier for working people to band together for a voice on the job by enabling them to form a union when the majority sign cards agreeing to unionize.  The bill would also set a timetable for employers to negotiate a first contract with the new union.
While both bills lay important legislative groundwork, the political reality is that a Tea Party-dominated Congress is highly unlikely to pass either piece of legislation anytime soon. And even as the National Labor Relations Board maneuvers within current law to uphold workers’ right to organize, the Supreme Court is poised to consider the case of Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, which could further undermine workers’ ability to join together in strong unions, particularly in the public sector. Meanwhile, organized labor is under attack in a growing number of states. And the still-secret language of the pending Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal raises concerns that American workers will be forced into greater competition with countries where workers and their unions are brutally suppressed, pushing wages down.
Movement that takes us one step forward and two steps back still leaves the nation headed in the wrong direction. With so many of the other core issues the Democrats will debate—from the burden of student debt, to the unaffordability of childcare, to climate change and the dominance of big money in our politics—intertwined with the need for working people to have a greater voice, it is critical that the next president get this right.
The suppression of workers' voice and labor standards more broadly didn't occur by accident and cannot be undone in a haphazard way. What's needed from the next President is a strategy that amplifies the voice of working people on a variety of fronts, from supporting empowering legislation to using executive power (for example, signing a ""good jobs"" executive order preferring federal contractors that respect employee rights to collective bargaining) and focusing explicitly on workers' rights when trade agreements, Supreme Court appointments, and other key decisions are made. To get their votes, every presidential candidate should promise to lift up workers' policies tomorrow night. ",blog
"Key Facts
Governor Cuomo has proposed a family leave insurance plan that includes critical features such as 12 weeks of job-protected leave,  replacement of as much as two-thirds of wages for low-paid workers on leave, and coverage of all employers.
In Rochester, a new mother, unable to get by on disability pay, is forced back to work just days after her baby is born. On Long Island, a young man can’t afford to miss a paycheck to help his wife recover from an accident. In the Bronx, a woman gives up her job, risking poverty to see her father through his last illness. Most countries and a growing number of U.S. states guarantee paid family leave to support working people and their families through the most significant moments of their lives, yet New York State lags behind. 
While the federal Family and Medical Leave Act has helped millions of Americans take unpaid leave and return to work, many working people do not qualify for leave under the Act or cannot afford to take time off work without pay.1 Yet this brief shows that relying on private employers to fill the need for paid family leave is not enough. We offer a new analysis of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ National Compensation Survey, finding that 6.4 million New York workers do not receive paid family leave from their employers.2 As a result, the vast majority of the state’s workforce—87 percent of non-farm, private sector workers in New York—lack a critical family support. This brief looks at the sectors where workers are most and least likely to have access to paid family leave and explains how a public family leave insurance system would provide a vital benefit to all working New Yorkers and their employers.
Paid Leave and New York Industries
More than 1 in every 6 New Yorkers works in health care and social assistance—the state’s largest job sector. Employees in this sector staff the state’s hospitals and nursing homes, provide assistance to the elderly, do social work, and take care of children.  Although their jobs support the most fundamental health and family needs of others, 84 percent of employees in health care and social assistance don’t have access to paid family leave through their jobs. Yet paid leave is even more scarce among the state’s other leading employment sectors: in retail, which employs almost a million workers statewide, 94 percent of employees lack paid family leave.


	In the New York’s third leading sector, accommodation and food service, the figure is 97 percent. The almost total absence of paid family leave in retail and food service jobs compounds the difficulty of sustaining a family with work in these industries, where many jobs are also plagued by low wages and unstable schedules.3
In general, the lowest-paid workers are far less likely than higher-paid workers to have access to paid family leave through their jobs. Nationwide, the most highly-paid quarter of the workforce is 4 times more likely to receive employer-provided paid family leave than the lowest-paid quartile of workers.4 Nevertheless, access to paid family leave is still not the norm for even the most highly-paid American and New York workers. 
In recent months, tech companies such as Facebook and Google and financial firms including the Blackstone Group, Goldman Sachs, and Credit Suisse have made headlines by expanding the paid leave benefits they offer new parents. Indeed, employers in the finance and insurance sector and in the information sector are the most likely to offer paid family leave to their workforce. Yet even in finance and insurance, 64 percent of New York employees still do not receive paid leave from their employer. In information, a sector that includes publishing and broadcasting as well as telecommunications and data processing, 74 percent of employees don’t have access to paid leave. While some of New York’s most dynamic and deep-pocketed companies have recognized the business benefits of offering paid family leave to their employees, many companies cannot afford to finance the benefit themselves, and a majority of workers lack this critical source of support even in the industries where paid leave is most abundant. 
Ensuring that the next generation gets a healthy, loving start in life—and that families don’t fall into poverty as they struggle to care for one another in times of sickness—are society-wide challenges, not problems that individual families and businesses can solve on their own. Surveys find that 80 percent of Americans, including 71 percent of Republicans, favor requiring all employers to offer paid leave to parents of new children and employees caring for sick family members.5 Polls of New Yorkers are similarly favorable, with 81 percent of New York City residents (including 80 percent of Republicans) supporting the establishment of a paid family leave insurance system even if it means a dollar a week would be deducted from their own paychecks to fund it.6
Benefits of Paid Leave in Other States
Similar systems established in California, New Jersey and Rhode Island have operated successfully for workers and have had little impact on how employers do business.7  On the worker side, research has found that when paid leave is available, mothers are less likely to drop out of the labor force when they have a baby and that their family incomes increase.8 Paid leave also improves child health outcomes—including reducing infant mortality rates—and is associated with better mental and physical health among new mothers. Fathers who take paid leave are more engaged in caring for their babies.9 While there is less research available on the effects of paid leave for workers who are caring for aging parents or other adult family members, caregivers’ need for paid leave is well documented: 1 in 6 American adults cares for an aging, ill, or disabled family member and the number is expected to grow as the population ages.10 Family caregivers regularly lose income, taking unpaid leave or exiting the workforce entirely to provide care.11 Paid family leave would address a significant unmet need for working caregivers.
On the business side, research finds that California’s paid family leave program has reduced absenteeism and improved retention among low-wage workers by ten percent.12 This represents no small savings given that turnover costs can amount to 25 to 200 percent of an employee’s annual compensation when recruiting, hiring, training, and other requirements are taken into account.13 Although business lobbyists were initially the most vehement opponents of California’s paid leave program, 5 years after its implementation 9 out of 10 employers reported no negative effect on business profitability or performance, with small businesses even less likely to detect any damaging impact on their bottom line.14 In New Jersey, the effects were similar, with a majority of employers reporting no increase in paperwork due to administration of the program and no employers finding any instances of employees abusing the program.15
Establishing a public paid family leave insurance system will enable New York businesses to remain competitive with New Jersey companies that can already offer their employees access to paid family leave at no additional cost. Paid family leave will also benefit small businesses that are currently unable to afford the same paid leave benefits that larger companies use to attract and retain employees. 
Paid Leave for All New Yorkers
National legislation to establish paid family leave has been introduced in Congress, but New York can’t afford to wait for Washington to act.16 To address the need now, New York should expand and modernize its 67-year-old Temporary Disability Insurance system to include paid family leave that can be used to care for a new baby, or a newly adopted or fostered child; a seriously ill family member; or to assist a family member who is deploying for military duty. Legislation that has already passed the New York State Assembly for a number of years would provide up to 12 weeks of job-protected leave paying benefits that replace two-thirds of an employee’s average weekly wage up to a set cap. Under the Assembly plan, family leave benefits are funded by an employee payroll deduction of 45 cents a week for the first year, with subsequent contributions based on the fund’s costs. 
It is encouraging that Governor Cuomo has also announced his support for paid family leave as a priority for the 2016 legislative session. The governor’s plan offers critical features including 12 weeks of job-protected leave and coverage of all employers with no exemptions. In addition, the governor has increased the wage replacement rate in his proposal, improving the ability of lower-paid workers to afford time with new babies and sick loved ones.  Without at least a two-thirds rate of wage replacement included in the Assembly bill and the governor’s new proposal, New York will remain a place where only higher-income people are able to take time to care for their families.
Conclusion
Even as a growing number of high-profile businesses are recognizing the benefits of paid family leave, the vast majority of working New Yorkers still do not receive paid leave through their employers. New York has much to gain from following the successful example of New Jersey and California and building a paid family leave insurance system that would provide up to 12 weeks of job-protected leave, paying benefits that replace two-thirds of an employee’s average weekly wage. Working New Yorkers deserve the time to care for their families.

"Credit reports and scores are made up entirely of information about individual consumers -- data that’s collected without our permission or even necessarily our knowledge -- but we don’t have free access to this information. Under federal law, consumers get one free credit report a year and must pay to see a credit score. Even then, the credit score we’ve paid for is often an “educational score” that may differ quite a bit  from the number lenders use to make loan decisions – with potentially serious consequences.
In our report “Discrediting America”  Demos argued that this state of affairs tilts the marketplace unfairly toward lenders and the credit reporting industry, putting consumers at a disadvantage. We called for consumers to be given free access to the actual credit scores used to make lending decisions.
Today, we are a step closer. Bloomberg News reports:
FICO, owner of the credit-scoring formula most widely used by U.S. lenders, is giving some consumers access to their credit scores for free, even before they apply for a loan. The offering starts today for credit-card holders of two companies: Barclaycard US, a unit of London-based Barclays Plc (BARC), and First Bankcard of Omaha, Nebraska-based First National Bank of Omaha, FICO said in a statement. San Jose, California-based FICO, formerly known as Fair Isaac Corp. (FICO), is talking to other banks about giving the scores for free, said Anthony Sprauve, the firm’s senior consumer credit specialist.
FICO ultimately hopes to make free credit scores available to millions of consumers. It’s a good step, but still a limited one. FICO is a private company, so it’s internal agreements with banks don’t have the force of law. Will the credit scores consumers are given really be the same ones lenders are using to evaluate them? And what about consumers who are not affiliated with a bank participating in the FICO program? They are certainly out of luck. So while this corporate action is an encouraging sign, legislation guaranteeing fair consumer access to credit scores is still needed.
As I’ve written:
Credit reports and scores have a direct and growing impact on Americans’ economic security and opportunity. Having poor credit can mean a consumer will end up paying a higher interest rate for a loan or a higher premium for car or homeowner’s insurance; have their application for a loan or insurance denied; be turned down for a job, or even be terminated from their current one. Credit history can affect the way Americans are treated by landlords, utility companies, and hospitals.
Given how consequential this information is and the fact that it is ultimately our personal data, we should have the right to access it free of charge.",blog
"Say you’ve got a booming industry, one that already employs 2 million workers in the U.S. and is poised to add 1.3 million additional jobs by 2020. Imagine that the jobs cannot be off-shored, that the work helps decrease federal deficits, and millions of Americans depend on the industry just to get through their daily lives.",media
"When it comes to boosting economic opportunity, President Obama isn’t going to wait for Congress anymore.  
In his State of the Union Address last night, the President made a powerful statement about employers’ obligation to reward work -- starting with his own obligation as the executive in charge of millions of federal contracts. 
In a study we released last May, Demos found that nearly two million private sector employees paid with federal tax dollars through contracts, loans, grants, leases and health spending, earn wages too low to support a family.  These are people working on behalf of America, doing jobs that we have decided are worthy of public funds—yet they’re being treated in a very un-American way. That’s why federal workers have been walking off the job for the last year, organizing with Good Jobs Nation to call on President Obama to raise their wages. 
Now the President has taken a major step to lift up hundreds of thousands of those workers. In the process, the president will help families work their way up out of poverty and give new momentum to efforts to raise the minimum wage for everyone laboring too hard for too little in today’s low-pay economy.
The truth is that preferring contractors who pay workers at least $10.10 an hour will have benefits far beyond the workers themselves and their families. When our tax dollars subsidize and promote the creation of low-wage jobs rather than positions that enable workers to afford the necessities of life, there is a ripple effect throughout the economy: poorly-paid workers have less to spend in their communities, and businesses facing less consumer demand in turn hire fewer workers, stunting economic recovery. Low-paid workers also contribute less in taxes and more often need public benefits to provide for their families. On the other hand, an economy where workers are able to earn family-supporting wages would have broad benefits. 
From the 1931 Davis-Bacon Act onward, the idea that the federal government should be a model employer – and that employees working on behalf of the public should have strong workplace protections – has an extensive history in our country. The use of executive orders to improve the employment practices of companies granted federal contracts also has a long precedent. Beginning in 1941, successive presidents from both parties signed executive orders aimed at preventing employment discrimination by federal contractors. President Obama’s order raising wages for companies that do business with the federal government follows this successful precedent.
If the cost of federal contracts is a concern, the spotlight should be not on the employees who will finally see a raise to $10.10 an hour, but rather on the over $21 billion a year the government spends on the pay of their bosses, the top executives at contracting firms. After Demos put a number on this subsidy of executive excess in a September report, Congress included a lower maximum  pay reimbursement for contractors in its December budget deal. But even the lower cap still provides executives a roughly $234.00 an hour subsidy. When you consider that our current contracting system fuels inequality through both lavish compensation for CEOs and poverty wages for front-line workers, it becomes clear where cost-cutting efforts should be focused. ",media
"When Walmart broke the bad news to shareholders last week about declining same-store sales and cuts to their profit and sales projections, the company offered a glib explanation. ""The retail environment was challenging,"" asserted Walmart Stores President and CEO Michael Duke. Company executives pointed to weather conditions and the January payroll tax increase to justify the disappointing sales, but larger questions about why consumers weren't buying were never addressed.
The unspoken reality is that America's low-income consumers have little money to spare. Average weekly earnings for all private-sector workers fell $3.09 in the last month. Yet Walmart itself, the nation's largest employer, could play a leading role in boosting consumer spending and bolstering the nation's slow economic recovery. Rather than lamenting the ""challenging"" and ""disappointing"" retail environment, Walmart could boldly move to reshape it.
The key step? Raising the company's notoriously low wages.
Substantially increasing pay for front-line workers would be an unexpected step for a company known for its laser-like focus on reducing operating costs. Yet by putting more money into the pockets of more than a million low-paid Walmart employees in the U.S., a raise would increase the buying power of the people most likely to spend their additional funds immediately -- and more likely than not, to spend it in Walmart's own stores.
When my organization, Demos, analyzed the retail industry last year, we projected the economic impact if all retailers employing 1,000 workers or more were to raise wages for their full-time, year-round employees to at least $25,000 a year. An annual income of $25,000 isn't much, but that wage is still higher than the $21,000 a typical retail sales person earned in 2012, and is far more than the $15,500 that analysts calculate the average Walmart associate earns annually.
A raise of that magnitude, we forecast, would increase GDP between $11.8 and $15.2 billion over the next year and would create 100,000 or more net new jobs. What's more, the increased purchasing power of low-wage employees would generate $4 to $5 billion additional annual sales for the retail sector itself. The additional payroll costs would represent just a small fraction of total sales, and the potential cost to consumers would be only a few cents more per shopping trip. If Walmart specifically were to raise its wages to $12 an hour, the average Walmart shopper would pay just $12.49 more in an entire year even if the company passed 100 percent of its costs on to shoppers, according to a separate analysis by the University of California Berkeley Labor Center.
And for Walmart, the benefits would go beyond increased sales and an improving retail environment. At a time when the retail giant has come under increased criticism for its disorganized stores and empty shelves, an investment in the frontline workforce could improve customer experience. While an end to the company's chronic understaffing would also be beneficial, higher pay would likely boost worker productivity and encourage employees to stay on the job long enough to become more experienced and helpful to customers.
A raise would also provide a public relations lift to a company battered by criticism of its poor job quality. Walmart's detractors come from increasingly high places: this year U.S. House of Representatives committee staff released a study singling out the corporation. According to the federal study, each Walmart store costs taxpayers approximately $1 million annually because of its employees' greater need for public assistance programs to support their families. By raising wages Walmart could shut down this criticism and smooth its entry into the urban markets the company needs for domestic expansion. Proposals like Washington DC's Large Retailer Accountability Act - designed to force Walmart and other big stores to pay living wages - would be deprived of their rationale.
Any retailer can bemoan the poor shopping climate. But Walmart has the size and industry clout to begin changing the weather, setting the retail industry and other employers on a higher wage, higher sales path.",blog
"As if the use of your personal credit information for hiring wasn’t sufficiently invasive and the collection and sale of employment data in the form of The Work Number wasn’t insidious enough, today’s New York Times has news of another secretive, unverified and unverifiable database that is shutting American workers out of jobs.
Facing a wave of employee theft, retailers across the country have helped amass vast databases of workers accused of stealing and are using that information to keep employees from working again in the industry.
The repositories of information, like First Advantage Corporation’s Esteem database, often contain scant details about suspected thefts and routinely do not involve criminal charges. Still, the information can be enough to scuttle a job candidate’s chances.
Some of the employees, who submit written statements after being questioned by store security officers, have no idea that they admitted committing a theft or that the information will remain in databases, according to interviews with consumer lawyers, regulators and employees.
Understandably no employer wants to hire workers who will steal from them. But employers might just have options other than resorting to black-list like secret databases that offer job applicants limited opportunities to contest allegations against them and correct the record.
It’s telling that these employee theft databases are most prevalent among big companies in the retail industry, an economic sector that includes many large and profitable companies that nevertheless pay their frontline workforce wages that keep them in poverty.
Harvard Business School professor Tatiana Sandino suggests that retail’s low wages and employee thefts may be linked. “Bigger paychecks for retail employees could generate significant payoffs for employers by reducing worker theft and raising the level of moral behavior in the workforce” notes a Harvard Business School summary of her work. While the payoff from reduced thefts alone would likely not be enough to make up the costs to retailers, research by Demos Policy Analyst Catherine Ruetschlin has found that raising wages for low-paid retail employees would have other benefits from retailers as well, boosting sales and inspiring higher productivity and lower turnover.
Fundamentally, it’s a question of what type of relationship large retailers want to have with their employees: a hostile one characterized by suspicion and fear that underpaid workers will give themselves a five-finger raise or a respectful relationship based on fair pay and opportunities for advancement, as retailers like Costco do.

"This wasn’t a good week for Walmart. The business model of the nation’s largest private employer is built on a lack of accountability. Walmart’s efforts to externalize as many costs of its business as possible onto taxpayers, its workforce, the environment, its suppliers, and the communities where it operates have enabled it to become one of the nation’s largest and most profitable companies -- and left the Walmart heirs among the wealthiest people on earth.  
Yet this week, Walmart’s wall of denial was breached in three critical places: the company’s efforts to claim top executives knew nothing about the practice of illegally bribing foreign officials; its ability to dodge accountability for the illicit labor practices of subcontractors it relies on and closely controls; and its success in reaping profits as one of the nation’s largest sellers of firearms while rejecting any responsibility for the epidemic of violence they facilitate; all suffered blows this week. As a result, the powerful company may finally find itself beginning to answer for the consequences of its actions.
First and most obvious is the Mexican bribery case. U.S. law prohibits American companies from bribing foreign officials. Yet, as the New York Times revealed in an exhuastive investigation last month, Walmart systematically violated the law.
Wal-Mart de Mexico was not the reluctant victim of a corrupt culture that insisted on bribes as the cost of doing business. . . . Wal-Mart de Mexico was an aggressive and creative corrupter, offering large payoffs to get what the law otherwise prohibited. It used bribes to subvert democratic governance — public votes, open debates, transparent procedures. It used bribes to circumvent regulatory safeguards that protect Mexican citizens from unsafe construction. It used bribes to outflank rivals.
Walmart’s top corporate officials denied knowing anything about the corrupt practices its Mexican subsidiary was using to attain profitable new store locations. Except that an investigation of internal company documents by U.S. Representatives Elijah Cummings and Henry Waxman reveals that senior executives, including CEO Michael Duke, knew exactly what was going on.
In a letter to the CEO published yesterday, the congressmen noted that “documents obtained by our staffs from a confidential source indicate that you and other senior Wal-Mart officials were personally informed about these bribery allegations on multiple occasions.” In addition to the congressional inquiry, the new revelations may provide more evidence for the mulitple lawsuits Walmart already faces from pension funds and other large shareholders suing the company in an effort to force reforms in its corporate governance.
While Walmart apparently wrings some profits from bribery, a far more central part of its business model is its ability to outsource as many core functions as possible to outside contractors and subcontractors and then demand such tight control and low prices that the ostensibly independent companies are obliged to break the law to meet their terms. Walmart profits from the unjust or illegal labor practices but can deny all responsibility. November’s deadly fire in a Bangladeshi factory supplying Walmart goods – complete with revelations that Walmart was a leader in  blocking efforts to improve fire safety in Bangladesh -- is a case in point.
But Walmart’s efforts to distance itself from the practices of its subcontracts suffered a blow this week when a judge ruled that Walmart could be charged as a defendant in a class action lawsuit alleging that a company shipping Walmart goods and temporary staffing agencies that provided workers failed to pay minimum wage or overtime. Walmart continues to insist that it’s not responsible for the actions of subcontractors. Yet, as Josh Eidelson reports in the Nation this week, the plaintiffs point out that “Walmart owns all equipment in the buildings, dictates that they be run in exactly the same manner as Walmart’s non-subcontracted warehouses, and keeps a full-time Walmart manager on site.” In other words, there’s a strong case that Walmart should be held legally liable for any wage theft that occurred at the warehouse. The judge evidently agrees.
Finally, consider the question of gun violence. Walmart is one of the nation’s largest purveyors of firearms, helping to increase the availability of assault weapons across the nation. In 2012, Walmart did 16.8 million background checks for gun purchases, and buyers may have bought multiple weapons with a single check. What did these millions of gun purchasers do with their new weapons? Walmart doesn’t know, and beyond the legally required background check, it disavows any responsibility for the flood of small arms it pours into communities. Yet this week also saw a tiny fissure in that wall of denial: after initially rejecting an invitation from Vice President Joe Biden to participate in a roundtable on gun violence, Walmart reversed its position yesterday and agreed to send a representative to the meeting.  It’s a small crack, but an acknowledgment on the part of the company that it plays a role in the proliferation of firearms used to perpetrate violence.
Facing new demands for accountability as it profits from corruption, exploitative practices by its subcontractors, and gun sales, 2013 is off to a bad start for Walmart. Yet the crumbling of denial may signify good things for the rest of us. After all, while Walmart is a particularly prominent example of corporate greed, it is far from the only multinational corporation that maximizes its own profitability by systematically externalizing its costs onto the rest of us. If Walmart can be made to answer for the consequences of its actions, other demands for accountability may succeed as well.",blog
"He may have less than a year left in his administration and be faced with a Congress so implacable that even a Supreme Court nominee lauded by former Bush Administration officials can’t get a hearing,  but President Obama can still be a force for progressive change.
 Just ask the 437,000 Americans working for federal contractors who lose pay every time they need to stay home sick. Thanks to an executive order the President signed last fall, these contract workers stand to gain paid sick leave for the first time. To extend paid sick leave to all working people, Congress would need to act, by passing legislation like the Healthy Families Act. But acting on his own, the President can use his executive authority over $1.3 trillion in federal contracting. 
As I’ve noted before, President Obama’s action on paid sick days is in keeping with his previous steps to raise workplace standards for contract employees the same way he would like to see them raised for all working Americans if only Congress took action:
President Obama has used his executive authority to raise wages for federal contract workers; ban contractors from employment discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity; ensure that contract employees who discuss their compensation are not retaliated against; and strengthen the screening process to ensure that companies that chronically violate federal workplace laws are no longer rewarded with federal contracts.
Demos research has quantified how the federal contracting system fuels inequality by funding low-wage jobs that lack critical benefits such as sick leave. Enabling people employed through federal contracts to accrue paid sick leave, combined with prior executive actions, is an important step toward reversing this process, rebuilding the country’s middle class and reaffirming the nation’s long-standing commitment to protecting workers working on behalf of America.
At the same time, by reducing the high cost of employee turnover, cutting the risk of contagious disease and raising the productivity associated with having healthy employees, the Executive Order and proposed rule will contribute to improved quality, economy, and efficiency in government procurement.
To make paid sick leave a reality for contract workers, the Department of Labor must now approve regulations implementing the order.  The National Partnership for Women and Families has developed a streamlined form for the public to urge the Department of Labor to finalize the rule and extend paid sick days to hundreds of thousands of working people. Submit comments here to urge the Department to act.
It may well fall to the next President to enact another key step in raising purchasing standards: an executive order ensuring that federal contracts go to companies that respect their employees’ right to band together and negotiate collectively for a fair return on their work.",blog
"More than two years after the recession officially ended, 25 million Americans – 16 percent of the labor force – are still out of work or underemployed.1 There are more than four jobseekers for every job opening. 6.2 million people have been out of work for more than six months. While the economic consensus is that federal stimulus measures prevented an even greater loss of jobs and a more severe downturn,2 these actions were clearly inadequate. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office projects that with current policies in place, it will take until 2016 to return to pre-recession employment levels.3 In short, the nation has a severe and persistent jobs deficit that will not be corrected simply through the workings of the market.
Persistent unemployment deepens existing inequalities, causing long-lasting harm to an individual’s future job prospects4 and making it harder for disadvantaged workers to ever work their way into the middle class. Population groups that are disproportionately unemployed – including people of color and Americans without a college education – suffer a far greater share of the long-term damage. Young people who are out of work also bear a greater long-term burden: even when employment rebounds, young adults will have more difficulty finding a job where they can reach their productive potential if they lack experience and professional networks built in their early working lives. For this reason, our jobs plan places priority on unemployed young people. 
The jobs deficit is also an obstacle to the economy’s overall recovery. While large-scale job loss was initially a result of the recession, it has become a self-reinforcing drag on economic growth. With so many people out of work, consumer spending remains sluggish and the housing market and construction industry cannot rebound. At the same time, businesses won’t see it as profitable to invest and hire more workers in the United States until consumer demand picks up. With no strong private-sector source of growth on the horizon, the jobs deficit provokes a vicious cycle that will keep unemployment high for years to come unless the dynamic is altered by decisive government action. Using public employment to create jobs for the unemployed directly and immediately is the most effective way to disrupt the cycle, accelerating economic recovery and giving those hardest hit by the recession what they need most – an opportunity to work. 
In a paper for Demos, economist Philip Harvey makes the case that a direct and immediate public jobs program would produce substantially more job creation for each public dollar spent than conventional fiscal stimulus measures such as tax cuts and public spending increases.5 A $100 billion, two-year public jobs program would create more than 1.5 million new jobs at peak employment, compared to 568,000 jobs created by a comparable increase in spending on unemployment insurance and food stamps, or just 108,000 jobs created by Bush-style tax cuts of comparable size.6

As Harvey explains, this strategy “also allows the government to offer work where it is most needed and to those individuals who most need it. Finally, it allows these jobs to be made available to people immediately, when they need them, rather than requiring them to wait for the economy to recover before they can put their lives back on track.”7
We propose investing a net $235 billion in the first year and $147 billion in the second year of a two-year public jobs program. This would create 8.2 million direct and indirect jobs, sufficient to reduce the nation’s unemployment rate to a pre-recession 4.5 percent. The program could be funded through the expiration of the Bush tax cuts (approximately $295 billion per year). The program design is described below.

"Advocates and policymakers are frequently asked how they plan to pay for progressive policy investments. This is how to respond.
No matter where we come from or what our color, most Americans want similar things in our lives: safe and stable homes and communities, medical care to keep us well, good jobs that pay enough to provide for our families, a chance to spend time with and care for the people who matter most to us, and access to schools and colleges that will enable us and our children to thrive in the world.1 Demos’ briefing books Everyone’s Economy (federal policy) and Everyone’s America (state policy) bring together policy solutions that put these basics within reach, addressing the economic challenges faced by working people and the families they support, as well as strengthening our democratic institutions to create meaningful participation and representation for all of us. Many of these policies require substantial public investment to improve people’s lives and our nation’s long-term prosperity. Accordingly, advocates and policymakers are frequently asked how they plan to pay for these investments. This memo provides guidance on how to respond.
“I reject the pay-for game. After the $1.5 trillion in unpaid-for tax cuts… I just reject the idea that only progressive ideas have to be paid for.""
 
— SENATOR BRIAN SCHATZ 2
America has abundant resources, yet for decades conservatives have deployed the rhetoric of scarcity to attack policies they oppose for ideological reasons. Their professed concerns about deficits melt away in the face of a $717 billion annual military appropriations bill or a $1.5 trillion tax law that delivers a windfall to wealthy corporations and the richest 1 percent of households.3 Meanwhile, our communities bear the tremendous costs of their selective austerity: young people who never receive the education they need to succeed, working people who lose time due to failing infrastructure, neighbors who lose their lives because they are denied access to medical care. If the Trump administration can fund a $12 billion bailout for agribusinesses harmed by the president’s trade policies4 and a new $100 billion tax giveaway to wealthy shareholders,5 the nation can certainly provide affordable child care to working families and retirement security to our seniors.
 
We all share the benefits of well-planned investments in schools, high-quality health care, clean air and water, and safe and well-maintained streets and other public goods that form the foundation of thriving communities.6 For example, researchers find:
 
In some cases, our common resources are catastrophically misdirected. For example:
On housing policy, criminal justice, climate equity, and a broad range of other policies, Demos’ briefing books provide guidelines for reinvesting in systems that genuinely serve people’s needs.17
 
With a mandate to balance their budgets, many states face significant constraints, yet state tax codes are riddled with giveaways to large corporations and the wealthiest households. Common-sense reforms will enable states to ensure the wealthiest residents contribute to building thriving communities:
Most Americans, whether black, white, or brown, share similar hopes for our families. But today, certain politicians and their greedy backers hurt everyone by avoiding contributing to our country and instead handing even more kickbacks to corporations and the rich. After giving Wall Street executives billions in extra cash, they claim we’re broke and demand we defund our schools and cut Medicare and Social Security for seniors. Then they turn around and point the finger for our hard times at poor families, black people and new immigrants. We need to join together with people from all walks of life to fight for our future, just like we won better wages, safer workplaces, and civil rights in our past. By joining together across racial differences, we can ensure America stands up for the things so many of us want in our lives: quality health care, good schools and colleges for ourselves and our children, and safe communities to live in.22",research
"Paid family leave is finally gaining steam in the United States. President Obama and the Democratic presidential candidates universally embrace the idea.  And while a conservative Congress may stymie federal action for years, states from New York to Colorado to Oregon are moving toward implementing their own family leave insurance systems, building on the success of policies already in place in California, New Jersey and Rhode Island.
In New York, Governor Cuomo has proposed a program that would allow all employees to take up to 12 weeks of leave and be paid a portion of their regular wages. New York’s program would be funded by employee payroll contributions starting at 70 cents a week, eventually increasing to $1.40 weekly. Polls show overwhelming public support for the proposal, including strong backing among Republicans.
Among a small minority, an unfounded objection continues to surface: why should I pay for my co-worker to spend time with her new baby? I don’t have children or plan to have any. Why should I shell out even $1.40 a week for someone else’s benefit?
Setting aside the unabashed self-centeredness of this argument—the willingness to disregard, for example, the substantial health benefits of paid leave for parents and the next generation of Americans—how can this objection be addressed?
In part, the objection rests on the misconception that paid leave can be used exclusively for bonding with a baby. In fact, in New York and most other state and federal proposals, paid leave can also be used by workers caring for family members who are injured or ill. That’s why the AARP—not primarily known as a child welfare organization—has endorsed the proposal and mobilized its 2.6 million New York members to in support.
To the paid leave dissenter I’d say: maybe you aren’t expecting a baby now. But if you have an aging parent who may someday need your support or a spouse who might require care to recuperate from a sudden illness, you will benefit from paid leave.
If your sister is hit by a truck, paid family leave will help you afford the time off work to be at her side in the hospital and through physical therapy—even if she lives in another state.
 And if you’re the one hit by a freak accident or illness? Paid family leave may enable a loved one to be there for you.
In some ways, the arguments against paying for paid family leave mirror the claims of “young invincibles” reluctant to pay for health insurance because they were convinced they wouldn’t need medical care in the foreseeable future.
The reality is that none of us are invincible. The world of work is structured as if we are truly independent and isolated, appearing on the job fully capable, without a need to give or receive care from cradle to grave. For decades, this fiction was sustained by the unpaid care of women: mothers, wives, and daughters nurturing and supporting workers and families. Now that women are fully a part of the workforce, and American families rely on their incomes to make ends meet, we can’t continue pretending to live in a universe where working people never need to provide care or be cared for.
We all relied on care as infants and children and more than likely will need someone to care for us again before we die. If someone ever cared for you, you have a stake in paid family leave.",blog
"The National Retail Federation is bearing glad tidings for the upcoming holiday season: America’s stores are expecting solid growth in holiday sales and may hire more than half a million seasonal employees. Non-seasonal employment in the sector is also improving, as retailers, led by clothing and clothing accessories stores, added 9,400 new jobs in September. But if business is booming in the retail sector, why are current retail workers hustling each week for enough hours to get by?
The problem is under-employment as a business strategy -- where workers see their hours cut at the last minute and are given on-call shifts to correspond to minute fluctuations in consumer demand. This just-in-time scheduling model may save retailers on labor costs in the short term, but it wreaks havoc on retail employees’ attempts to plan their days and weeks or make budgets. Set retail wages aside for a moment: today’s workplace struggle is just as much about stable, predictable schedules that allow employees to attend school, get a second job, or plan child care.
That’s the fight that brought retail workers and their allies to the sidewalks of Manhattan’s posh 5th Avenue shopping district yesterday. Organized by the Retail Action Project, demonstrators highlighted a “wheel of misfortune,” illustrating the lousy odds that workers would actually get to work the shift they were scheduled for. At the same time, employees called out some of the large and profitable companies that are short-shifting their workforce. The first target was Abercrombie and Fitch, which has slashed employee schedules while continuing to hire new workers, according to a petition for sustainable scheduling started by one frustrated worker. “Abercrombie & Fitch portrays a happy and carefree lifestyle,” points out employee Bintou Kamara, “but people like me who work in their stores are struggling because we don’t get enough hours. . . My co-workers and I have asked our managers for more hours, but we’re told that’s just how it is.”
It may be how it is, but that’s not how it has to be: as Demos fellow Katherine Stone pointed out on this blog recently, collective bargaining in the airline industry helped flight attendants to overcome the much more complicated scheduling challenges of working on board inter-state and international flights.  Closer to home, the retail union representing New York City’s major department stores has negotiated contracts that guarantee hours for part-time and full-time workers and provide schedules well in advance.  
But how do struggling part-time employees of Abercrombie & Fitch, UNIQLO or other 5th Avenue retailers get to that point? The Retail Action Project announces that it aims to “build worker and community power to hold corporate retailers accountable and advance policy solutions.” And that’s exactly what it will take.",blog
"America’s growing inequality is well-documented. Less discussed is its intersection with another of the country’s defining trends, growing diversity.
Racial disparities in wealth are vast. And addressing inequality now and in the years ahead, means thinking seriously about the racial wealth gap and the steps we can take to ameliorate it.
The statistics are stark. The typical black household now possesses just 6 percent of the wealth owned by the typical white household, and the typical Latino household owns only 8 percent of the wealth of the typical white household. There was not sufficient data on Asian or Native American households to include in the analysis.
These wealth disparities are rooted in historic injustices, but they are maintained and extended by policies that continue today. Colorblind policymaking has not been sufficient to address the wealth gap: to build a more equitable and secure future, policymakers must actively work to reverse public policies that fuel racial disparities in wealth. But which policies could make the greatest difference?",media
"Entire movements are based around these economic realities: the minimum wage is too low to live on. Eligibility for overtime pay must be broadened so that workers are fairly compensated for all of the time they work. Basic workplace standards need to be improved.
But improved standards only lead to improved lives when they’re enforced. If employers believe they can get away with violating the rules without consequence, the finest and fairest laws in the land won’t protect workers’ rights and livelihoods. Minimum wage violations cost working people an estimated $1 billion a year in New York State alone according to a report last year from the U.S. Department of Labor. An estimated 26,000 working families in New York were driven into poverty as a result of the looted paychecks. Another 68,000 were pushed deeper into poverty. The federal, state, and local governments also lose tax revenue and take on millions in extra costs for public benefits.
Does anyone ever get punished for this crime? And do they get more than a slap on the wrist if they do?
Today they did.
This afternoon, the owner of nine Papa John’s pizza franchises in the Bronx was arrested for cheating hundreds of employees out of pay and falsifying business records to cover it up. Prosecutors are seeking $460,000 in back wages and damages to workers, as well as a $50,000 civil penalty and jail time for the owner. The issue is not an inadvertent misunderstanding of the law but a deliberate scheme to steal worker pay. According to the New York Attorney General’s Office and the Department of Labor:
[The owner] Khokhar and BMY Foods, Inc. allegedly did not pay the overtime premium as required by law. Instead, charges allege they paid workers the same, regular rate of pay for all hours worked, including hours in excess of forty. To hide this practice, they allegedly paid for overtime hours in cash, to avoid creating a record. They also allegedly created fictitious names for employees to use in their computerized timekeeping system: once employees’ weekly hours reached 35 or 40 per week, they were allegedly required to use the fictitious names so that the employer’s failure to pay proper overtime for these hours would be concealed. Khokar and BMY Foods Inc. allegedly made the cash payments under the fake names and kept separate paper records reflecting both the check and cash payments made to the same workers. In a further attempt to conceal this scheme, the defendants allegedly filed fraudulent tax returns with the State of New York that omitted the cash payments made under fictitious names.
This is the ugly—and all too common—face of wage theft. As surely as the nation must fix overtime rules, raise the minimum wage, and establish other basic workplace rights we also need strong enforcement like this to ensure that once laws are on the books they actually provide the fundamental protection working people need.",blog
"Demos’ new briefing book, Everyone’s Economy, offers an economic agenda that will enable all of us to thrive. Women’s History Month is an opportunity to dig into the ways that a race-conscious, populist economic agenda must elevate women. Over the next 2 weeks, Demos will share a series of blog posts that explore different ways that policy can impact women’s economic opportunity and stability. Today we look at why reproductive justice is vital to women’s economic well-being.
The ability to make decisions about whether and when to have children is critical to the economic security of women and their families. 
The ability to make decisions about whether and when to have children is critical to the economic security of women and their families. Having a child is one of life’s most serious commitments, economically and otherwise. An unintended pregnancy can upend financial stability, making it difficult for mothers in particular to pursue education and maintain employment. Yet in 2011, 45 percent of U.S. pregnancies were unintended. Due to lower incomes and more limited access to birth control, black and Latina women, young women, and women living below the poverty line were the most likely to experience an unintended pregnancy. Lack of access to effective birth control and abortion compounds the inequalities that already exist. Unfortunately, in recent years and with alarming frequency, a barrage of attacks at both the federal and state level threatens to further restrict women’s access to birth control and abortion services.
To achieve full equality, women must have the right to control their own bodies and the ability to plan their own families. Policymakers must safeguard the economic security of women and their families by defending against policies that make it difficult to access affordable reproductive health services, and championing policies that expand access to these services. Policymakers should protect access to no-cost contraception under the Affordable Care Act or any other health care law, and champion legislation that limits religious and so-called moral exemptions for employers. The Equal Access to Abortion Coverage in Health Insurance Act (EACH), introduced in the 2015-2016 legislative cycle, is a critical piece of legislation, ensuring abortion coverage and care through the federal government in its role as an insurer, employer, or health care provider, and prohibiting state, local or federal restrictions on private insurance coverage of abortion care.

"The Smithsonian is a national treasure. The world's largest museum and research complex, it encompasses a remarkable 19 museums and galleries, the National Zoo, and nine research centers. In many ways, the institution represents what’s best about America, including free access to our cultural treasures and our collective historical memory. That’s what it’s especially troubling that low-wage workers employed under federal concession agreements went on strike at the Smithsonian Museums this morning. One of the most high-minded American institutions allows the people serving food within its walls to be treated in an un-American way on the job. Workers, organized as Good Jobs Nation, are calling on President Obama to guarantee a living wage and a voice at work.
These workers are part of a larger trend my Demos colleague Robert Hiltonsmith and I documented in our recent study, “Underwriting Bad Jobs: How Our Tax Dollars Are Funding Low-Wage Work and Fueling Inequality.” We found that nearly two million private sector employees working on behalf of America earn wages too low to support a family. That represents hundreds of billions of dollars in federal contracts, grants, loans, concession agreements and property leases—paid for by our tax dollars—going to private companies that pay low wages, provide few benefits, and offer employees little opportunity to work their way into the middle class. 
While our study covered workers across the United States and considered the cost of living nationwide, the situation may be even more grim in Washington DC, where federal contract spending is concentrated. Recent research from the Economic Policy Institute finds that meeting a family’s basic needs is harder in the District of Columbia than in almost any other U.S. city. As Sarah Berday-Sacks at the DC Fiscal Policy Institute notes:
There is a sharp difference between the income of many DC families and the costs of a no-frills family budget. In a family of four, both parents would need to earn an hourly wage of $21.30 to afford basic household expenses. But a DC resident working at minimum wage only earns $8.25 an hour – about 40% of the necessary basic family budget even with two earners. For families with one wage earner, the challenges are even greater. The typical worker in DC earns enough to cover just 60 percent of the basic family budget relying on one earner.
To make matters worse still, a recent complaint to the Department of Labor by workers at the Ronald Reagan federal building alleges that concessionaires in the building are actually paying less than the already grossly inadequate minimum wage and are violating other labor protections.
But while workers’ families are struggling, not everyone working for a federal contractor or concessionaire is poorly paid. Under current law, contractors can be reimbursed by taxpayers for as much as $763,029  in compensation for each top manager. This is one way our current model of federal outsourcing and contracting worsens the trends toward inequality already harming our economy.
At the bottom of the Smithsonian’s website is an image honoring the centennial of Woody Guthrie. There’s little question where this balladeer of ordinary Americans and their strugglesincluding fights for better pay and union representation—would have stood in the current dispute between the Smithsonian and the workers who serve food to its patrons. Officials at the Smithsonian would do well to listen to any of Woody’s directly pro-worker and pro-union songs available for purchase from their own website.  But the most relevant message might come from the Dust Bowl classic, “Goin' Down The Road Feeling Bad.”

"Discrimination has no place in New York. At our best, we’re a city where people of all races, ethnicities, creeds, and backgrounds have an opportunity to work hard and make their mark. But today in New York, many qualified job seekers are turned away from employment because of their personal credit history. The practice disproportionately harms people of color, who are more likely to have poor credit as a result of predatory lending that continues to target communities of color, as well as the enduring impact of racial discrimination in employment, lending, education, and housing. But the problem isn’t limited to any one community: New Yorkers from all walks of life whose credit is damaged as a result of medical debt, student loans, a layoff, divorce, identity theft or simple error are shut out of jobs—despite lacking evidence connecting someone’s credit history with their job performance.
The Stop Credit Discrimination in Employment Act, intro 261 which has 39 sponsors on the New York City Council, would prohibit the use of personal credit history in employment, eliminating a serious barrier to economic security for many New Yorkers. If passed, it would provide the strongest protection against credit discrimination in the nation. This fact sheet discusses the major reasons why the Stop Credit Discrimination in Employment Act is critical to ensuring fair and equal access to job opportunities.
Nearly half of all employers run credit checks on new job applicants.
Employment credit checks are widespread, and used by employers to screen job applicants for a wide range of positions. For example, credit checks may be required for jobs doing maintenance work, offering telephone tech support, working as a delivery driver or selling frozen yogurt as well as financial posts. A 2012 survey by the Society of Human Resources Management found that 47 percent of employers use credit checks when hiring for some or all positions at their firm.1
New Yorkers are denied jobs because of credit checks.
Personal stories of New Yorkers like Marine Corps veteran Emmett Pinkston of Brooklyn and Gustavo Panesso of Queens underscore the high cost of credit checks on economic opportunity throughout our city.2 A nationally representative survey by Demos finds that among low- and middle-income households with credit card debt, one in four unemployed Americans has been asked to submit to a credit check as part of a job application.3 One in ten job applicants in this survey group were told they would not be hired for a position because of their credit.4
Credit checks were never designed to assess potential job performance—or measure character.
Credit reports were developed to help lenders assess the risks associated with making a loan. Over the last few years, they have been aggressively marketed to employers as a means to gauge an applicant’s character or likelihood to commit theft or fraud. Yet there is no proven link between personal credit reports and criminal behavior or performance of a specific job.5 A spokesperson for TransUnion, one of the major credit reporting companies, admitted in 2010: “We don’t have any research to show any statistical correlation between what’s in somebody’s credit report and their job performance or their likelihood to commit fraud.”6
A weak or poor credit history is often linked to medical debt and unemployment.
Research by the Federal Reserve Board finds that more than half of all accounts reported by collection agencies on credit reports consist of medical debt.7 Demos’ study of Americans with credit card debt similarly finds that poor credit is associated with lack of health coverage and medical debt as well as household unemployment.8 Unemployed workers in particular can become trapped in a Catch-22: job-seekers are unable to secure a work because of damaged credit and are then unable to escape debt and improve their credit because they cannot find work.
Employment credit checks can have a discriminatory impact on people of color.
Research from the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Reserve Board, and other investigators concludes that African American and Latino households tend to have worse credit, on average, than white households.9 Racial disparities in credit history may reflect the damage done by predatory lending that continues to target communities of color, as well as the enduring impact of racial discrimination in employment, lending, education, and housing. One result is that when credit history is used to evaluate job candidates, people of color may disproportionately be screened out. Numerous civil rights organizations, including the NAACP, National Council of La Raza, and Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, have publicly opposed the use of employment credit checks.10
Credit reporting errors are common and impact employment decisions in unpredictable ways.
A comprehensive 2013 study by the Federal Trade Commission found that one in five American consumers had a material error (an error that negatively impacted their credit history) on a credit report from one of three major credit reporting companies.11 While not all of these errors are serious enough to affect consumer borrowing, the impact on employment is far broader because what employers look for in a credit report—and how much they weigh different factors like late bills, foreclosures, or accounts in collection —is entirely subjective. A credit reporting mistake that is too small to make a difference in applying for credit might nevertheless stand out to an employer and cost someone a job. At the same time, credit reporting errors are notoriously difficult for consumers to resolve.
Employment credit checks are an invasion of privacy—a particular concern for people with disabilities and victims of domestic abuse.
Domestic abuse, divorce, and medical bills are among the leading contributors to credit problems. In cases of domestic abuse, it is not uncommon for the abuser to purposely ruin a spouse’s credit as a way of controlling the spouse.12 Despite common sense and legal recognition that questions about marital status, medical conditions, and abuse ought to be out of bounds in the hiring process, many employers ask prospective employees to “explain” any credit problems brought to light by a credit report,13 leaving job applicants to choose between discussing a recent divorce, confidential medical issues, and/or very personal details regarding the abusive dynamics in a relationship, or risk losing a job opportunity. Questions about medical debt particularly impact people with disabilities, for whom disclosure of a medical condition may lead to discriminatory treatment.
The use of personal credit history to screen job applicants illegitimately obstructs access to employment, placing an unnecessary obstacle in the path of job seekers who are often already disadvantaged by racial discrimination, disability status, lack of health coverage, unemployment and other economic challenges. The Stop Credit Discrimination in Employment Act would remove this unwarranted barrier, increasing job opportunities for qualified applicants. 
For a deeper look at this issue, see Demos’ study, Discredited: How Employment Credit Checks Keep Qualified Workers out of a Job.

"Three years ago today the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau opened its doors. It was a new government agency produced by the Dodd-Frank Act: part of Congress’ attempt to address the rampant misconduct by banks, mortgage lenders, ratings agencies and other financial institutions that brought on the 2008 financial crisis and started the Great Recession. In its three years of existence, the CFPB has already forced credit card companies to return $1.5 billion to consumers that they deceived with fraudulent add on products; reformed mortgage lending rules to ensure borrowers have a genuine ability to repay their loans; and began to sue student loan companies for predatory practices, among many other accomplishments. 
The agency also handles direct consumer complaints about abusive and deceptive financial products and services—400,000 of them so far. It’s a highly impressive record for a fledging agency.
Now the CFPB wants to let consumers take their complaints public, going beyond the existing database of bare-bones information to enable consumers to provide a full narrative with context about the financial products or services they believe harmed them and how the problem has impacted their lives. Consumers can anonymously tell the whole story about the credit reporting company that refused to remove a blatant error from their report, the mortgage servicer that started a foreclosure despite a history of on-time payments, or the car dealership that marketed deceptive auto loans. The companies they are complaining against would have an opportunity post a public response that would appear alongside the complaint at the same time it is made public. Consumer participation is entirely voluntary, and “if consumers decide at any time that they would like to withdraw consent to publish their narratives, they would have that ability.”
Advocates with Americans for Financial Reform (of which Demos is a member) have called for a public narrative data base for some time. A recent statement describes the benefits:
“Public access to consumer complaints can help individuals make smart decisions upfront. Consumers will be able to draw their own conclusions from the data. Those who identify a company with disreputable lending practices or poor complaint resolution will be in a position to harness the power of the purse to protect themselves. Businesses with good products and customer service will benefit, and academics, researchers and others will be able to help the agency spot harmful trends and patterns before they become widespread.”
At a field hearing unveiling the proposal, CFPB director Richard Cordray laid out additional reasons to make narratives public:
“With these powerful stories made available to the public, companies would have more incentive to address potential shortcomings in their businesses that are harming consumers. The narratives should encourage companies to improve the overall quality of their products and compete more vigorously over good customer service. And because the database is updated daily, exposing problems early can help other consumers avoid similar problems before they become victims too. The market could react to problems as they occur, not years later. This could help spur competition based on consumer satisfaction, which has the potential to improve the functioning, transparency, and efficiency of the financial marketplace.”
Who could be against that?
According to American Banker  “the banking industry is apoplectic” about the proposal. Bankers worry that complaints which a financial institution considers unfounded will be read by other consumers and harm their reputations.  “A company may not want to provide the same level of detail as a consumer about how it responded” to complaints, notes American Banker. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the American Bankers Association get to the heart of the dispute:  a public database has the potential to change the balance of power between financial institutions and their consumers. “If I'm a company, I'm at a disadvantage. The consumer can be anonymous where I certainly cannot."" Yet putting more power into the hands of consumers that are often taken advantage of by banks, lenders, credit reporting giants, and other purveyors of financial services is precisely what the CFPB was established to do.
The enraged opposition of the American Bankers Association reminds us that the CFPB was always an embattled agency. In 2009, the Chamber of Commerce’s promised to “spend whatever it takes” to stop the CFPB from being established. When the agency was founded anyway, Republicans prevented Elizabeth Warren, originator of the agency, from ever becoming its official leader and then carried on a long refusal to confirm alternative director Richard Cordray, despite universal recognition that he was highly qualified and competent. This year, efforts to undermine the CFPB continue with the House passing legislation to gut the agency.   While voters continue to strongly and consistently support the CFPB and its mission, empowering financial consumers will always be unpopular among those seeking to make a buck off their vulnerability and lack of information.
It’s on that note that we wish a happy third birthday to the CFPB. They haven’t managed to kill it yet. And the opportunity to publicly voice complaints about financial products and services is just its latest accomplishment worth celebrating.",blog
"The first astonishing thing about the nation’s credit reporting system is its sheer massive size: data is compiled and exchanged about 1.3 billion consumer credit accounts pertaining to 200 million American adults. But what’s even more astonishing is how control over this ocean of data – information that can determine whether any one of those 200 million Americans will get a car loan, pay more for insurance, be allowed to rent an apartment, or be considered for a job – is consolidated into just a few hands. A new report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) maps out the industry, providing an overview of “how the nation’s largest credit bureaus manage consumer data.” 
The report confirms Demos’ own research on the structure of the credit reporting industry, detailing how a handful of colossal companies trade in the data that shapes our economic lives. And while the CFPB’s findings draw on existing public data rather than original investigations using the new CFPB supervisory powers that went into effect in September, the report’s view of the industry and its shortcoming is nevertheless telling.
Three major privately-held credit reporting companies dominate the industry. And while the Big Three receive information from approximately 10,000 “furnishers of data,” from the bank that affirms you’re making student loan payments on time to the collection agency that insists you never finished paying off that hospital bill, more than half of the accounts appearing in consumer credit files come from just ten large institutions. Although the CFPB doesn’t name names, you can guess who they are: the big banks that issue credit cards, auto loans, student loans, and mortgages reporting information about these many lines of credit. Much of the credit reporting system is a mechanized conversation among these giant companies about the extent to which you’re keeping current with credit card payments so they can determine what rate they should offer you on the next card.
Sometimes, that conversation goes wrong. While the most recent CFPB report does not attempt to determine the rate of credit reporting errors, the many ways errors can arise – and the flawed system for resolving disputes – is amply documented. In the words of the National Consumer Law Center:
The CFPB report describes an automated dispute system in which the credit bureau often limits its role in disputes to little more than assigning codes as to what type of dispute is at issue: the credit bureaus do not examine documents, contact consumers by phone or email, or exercise any form of human discretion in resolving a dispute. The vast majority (85%) of credit reporting disputes are passed on to the company (known as a furnisher) that provided the information. However, according to the CFPB, “the documentation consumers mail in to support their cases may not be getting passed on to the data furnishers for them to properly investigate and report back to the credit reporting company.”
The problems with erronous accounts are daunting enough for the big banks that the system was geared to handle. But the proliferation of small, sometimes irresponsible debt collection companies presents even greater challenges: while debt collection accounts make up only 13 percent of the accounts in credit reports, they are the source of 40 percent of consumer disputes. Improved regulation and supervision of these firms is clearly necessary.  
In “Discrediting America”  Demos argued that “The CFPB should require credit reporting agencies to meaningfully review and evaluate disputes by consumers, and provide a meaningful review process to individuals who have had their disputes denied.” With its latest report, the CFPB has built its own solid research foundation that amply justifies taking action.",blog
"This morning the Senate Banking Committee will hold a hearing on the nomination of Richard Corday  to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. On the merits, Cordray should breeze through.  The politics, however, are destined to be thornier.
Nobody questions that Richard Cordray, the former Ohio Attorney General who has led the CFPB since January 2012, is highly competent and supremely qualified to continue in his position. Nor is the impact of the agency itself in doubt: in 2012 alone, 6 million U.S. consumers received refunds from financial services companies as a result of CFPB enforcement actions, according Americans for Financial Reform, and the agency has handled more than 130,000 consumer complaints since it opened its doors less than two years ago. Whether it’s protecting consumers from the type of reckless and deceptive mortgage lending that sparked the economic downturn or beginning to oversee the massive credit reporting companies that shape the financial lives of American consumers, the CFPB has proven itself to be a critical consumer watchdog.
Yet last month 43 Republican Senators sent President Obama a letter asserting that they would refuse to permit a vote to consider any nominee to lead the CFPB unless the agency was restructured in ways that would significantly weaken it. This despite the fact that the agency’s creation and structure was determined by legislation passed by both chambers of Congress and signed into law by the president nearly three years ago.
The Senators’ concerns regarding the CFPB’s structure are unfounded. As Demos President Miles Rapoport noted in a recent letter to the Senate Banking Committee:
Under current law, the Bureau is fully accountable to the American people, to Congress, the judiciary, and the President. It has sufficient freedom of action to operate successfully, but it is also already more constrained – by oversight from other regulators and by special review by small business representatives – than any other financial agency.
So why the push to weaken the agency by blocking Cordray? It’s certainly not because of anti-agency outcry by voters: polls show strong and broad public support for the CFPB and its mission. In addition, the vast majority of small business owners support the CFPB and many leaders of financial firms overseen by the agency appreciate the CFPB’s transparent procedures and the chance to operate in a marketplace with clear and predictable rules.
But not every corporation is resigned to the inevitability of a strong consumer watchdog overseeing financial matters – even if it is the result of popularly supported and democratically enacted legislation. As a result, the standoff over the CFPB’s structure and leadership may be another illustration of how the dominance of American politics by big business undermines the nation’s economic mobility, along the same lines Demos’ David Callahan and Mijin Cha outlined in their recent “Stacked Deck” report. After all, upward mobility for ordinary Americans is significantly destabilized if we are buried by high-interest student debt, besieged by predatory loans, cheated out of our homes with deceptive mortgages, or losing our retirement nest eggs to high fees. Yet sectors of the financial services industry can turn a handsome profit from these unfair and misleading practices. As the non-partisan Public Campaign points out, the senators pledging to block the CFPB have received $143 million in financial industry campaign contributions.
That may be just what it takes to stack the deck against the rest of us.",blog
"Dear Ms. Smith,
Dēmos submits these comments in response to the Federal Register Notice from the Department of Labor seeking information regarding exemptions from the Fair Labor Standards Act’s minimum wage and overtime requirements, RIN 1235-AA20. Dēmos is a public policy organization working for an America where we all have an equal say in our democracy and an equal chance in our economy. The updated overtime regulation located at 29 CFR part 541 effectively advances economic opportunity and equality and should be fully implemented and enforced. Accordingly, Dēmos strongly opposes any effort to reopen or reconsider the rule, which has already been extensively assessed with abundant opportunity for all stakeholders to contribute their perspective.
The Final Rule raises the salary threshold used to determine which employees are exempt from overtime pay to $47,476 providing or reinforcing overtime protections for an estimated 12.5 million working Americans and their families.i According to the Department of Labor’s own analysis, the overtime rule would have resulted in an average annual increase in pay of $1.2 billion per year.ii The raise in pay would likely stimulate consumer spending. Since women, people of color, and younger workers are the most likely to work in moderately-paid salaried jobs, these workers would have seen the greatest gains and stand to lose the most from any effort to revise the salary threshold downward.
The $47,476 salary level is amply supported by economic analysis and is essential to restoring the effectiveness of the EAP exemption determination. By the time the Department released its proposed update to the overtime salary threshold in 2015, the applicable $23,660 threshold, set in 2004 without any mechanism for automatic increase, was below the poverty line for a family of four and covered just 8 percent of salaried workers; by comparison, the 1975 salary threshold covered 62 percent of salaried workers.
This is because as the economic analysis accompanying the Final Rule demonstrated, the 2004 revisions to the EAP Exemption (the “2004 Rule”) were fatally flawed. The traditional methodology for defining the EAP Exemption had been to pair a robust test of employee duties (the “Long Test”) with a relatively low salary-level test (the “Long-Test Salary Level”), and a less rigorous duties test (the “Short Test”) with a significantly higher salary-level test (the “Short-Test Salary Level”). In the 2004 Rule, however, the Department set a “standard” duties test by reference to the Short Test, but arrived at a “standard” salary-level test that was as low as the Long-Test Salary Level. This mismatch was not adequately justified by economic analysis and allowed, by the Department’s later estimation, well over 700,000 overtime-eligible employees to be misclassified as exempt under the EAP exemption. The Department corrected the mismatch by promulgating the 2016 Rule, which retains the Short Test as the standard duties test while returning to essentially a Short-Test Salary Level for the standard salary level.
Were DOL to revise the salary threshold downward in any meaningful fashion, it would serve to perpetuate this mismatch, necessitating a revision of the duties test in order to make it far more vigorous than it currently is. Businesses and their associations repeatedly implored DOL to leave the duties test alone, both during the extensive stakeholder engagement DOL conducted prior to issuing its proposed EAP rule, and in their comments reiterated time and time again in their comments submitted in response to the proposed rule. In deference to these stakeholders, DOL acceded to this request, but it necessitated the robust salary threshold promulgated and supported by extensive economic analysis.
Americans are working longer hours, more productively than ever before, yet their pay is still not keeping up with their labor and productivity. Instead of wasting resources revisiting the well- assessed provisions of the Final Rule, Dēmos urges the Department of Labor to stand true to its mission “to foster, promote, and develop the welfare of the wage earners” of the United States by defending the final rule and preserving the salary threshold it establishes.

"As of today, New Yorkers’ personal finances are none of their bosses’ business. Today Local Law 37, prohibiting discrimination based on consumer credit history, goes into effect. As a result, employers can no longer ask employees or job applicants to undergo a credit check to get a job—or keep one—except in certain very restricted circumstances.
I’ve written at length about why New York needs this law: how employment credit checks are a serious barrier to economic security for job applicants who may have flawed credit due to unemployment, lack of health coverage, student loans, or simple errors in their credit report. I’ve noted that credit reports don't have real value to employers as they cannot reveal whether someone would be a trustworthy, reliable, or hard-working employee. And I’ve noted how employment credit checks disproportionately harm people of color, who are more likely to have poor credit as a result of predatory lending that continues to target communities of color, as well as the enduring impact of racial discrimination in employment, lending, education, and housing.    
Now what’s left is enforcement. Here’s how the New York City Commission on Human Rights, tasked with implementing the law, explains the new rights of employees and job seekers:
Employers cannot run a credit check on you or hire another company to perform a credit check on you. If an employer asks you to sign a document so it can check your credit, it is breaking the law. Employers cannot use consumer reporting agencies or third party companies, services, and websites to examine your credit history.

		Employers also cannot ask about your payment history or credit worthiness, credit standing, or how much credit you have. That includes credit card debt, child support, student loans, foreclosures, missed or late payments, bankruptcies, judgments, and liens. This law applies whether you are currently working or looking for a job.
 
Your credit cannot be the reason you are fired, not hired, or not promoted. Under the NYC Human Rights Law, employers are prohibited from considering credit when making employment decisions about current or potential employees.
Demos is proud to have worked with allies at the New Economy Project, NYPIRG, DC 37, RWDSU, legal services groups throughout the city, and many other organizations to help make this legislation a reality. We congratulate NYC Council Member Brad Lander and the bill’s other co-sponsors for helping to stamp out an insidious form of discrimination.   
What if your apply for a job and are asked to authorize a credit check? If an employer conducts an employment credit check in violation of the law, employees and job applicants can call 311 and ask for the Commission on Human Rights. As the Commission notes: “we can help you recover lost wages and other damages, and we can fine the employer for breaking the law.”
Local Law 37 was the result of more than three years of work by Demos and New York City Council members to prohibit discrimination based on consumer credit history: ",blog
"“The same company that brings in the most food stamp dollars in revenue—an estimated $13 billion last year—also likely has the most employees using food stamps.”
The name of the mammoth food stamp-reliant company is no secret: Walmart.
As journalist Krissy Clark notes in Marketplace’s valuable new series “The Secret Life of the Food Stamp,” Walmart benefits from food stamps in multiple ways, as taxpayers both underwrite the company’s food sales and also subsidize its payroll costs.
There is no doubt that food stamps (and a host of other public subsidies from Medicaid to home heating assistance to the Earned Income Tax Credit and beyond) reduce Walmart’s employment costs substantially. A study released last year by staff of the U.S. House Committee on Education and the Workforce found that a single 300-employee Walmart Supercenter may cost taxpayers anywhere from $904,542 to nearly $1.75 million per year.
Consider that the working people who turn to food stamps to supplement inadequate wages are demonized as society’s lazy “takers”—a young Walmart employee who enrolled in food stamps to help support his pregnant partner told Marketplace that previously “I'd always considered people who use food stamps as just taking advantage of the government.” Yet the company itself continues to be seen as a paragon of free enterprise, notwithstanding the tens of billions of dollars in subsidies through the same program.
Marketplace has done a great service by shining light on a key public misperception, illuminating the low-wage employers who benefit most from programs like food stamps. Yet an important part of the story still gets missed. It’s probably intended to be a rhetorical question when part II of the food stamp series asks: “Are Walmart’s prices so low because its employees are on food stamps?” But the answer is no.
In reality, it’s not Walmart’s low prices that taxpayers are subsidizing—it’s the company’s mammoth profits.
Walmart made $17 billion in profit in 2013, and spent $7.6 billion buying back shares of its own stock—further consolidating the company’s ownership in the hands of the Walton heirs, already among the wealthiest people on the face of the earth. As my colleague Catherine Ruestchlin and I explain in our 2013 study, these stock buybacks did nothing to boost Walmart’s productivity or bottom line. They contributed zilch to cutting consumer prices or keeping those prices low. But if, for example, funds from this financial maneuvering were redirected to Walmart’s low-paid employees, workers would each see a raise of $5.83 an hour. As a result, the overwhelming majority of Walmart workers would no longer need to turn to food stamps to supplement their wages. Other observers have found additional ways the company could substantially boost pay (and reduce reliance on food stamps) without increasing prices. Yet Walmart has made a decision to continue its dependence on food stamps and other public subsidies.
It’s no surprise that Walmart itself works to obscure the pivotal role of its corporate decision making. David Tovar, Walmart’s vice president of communications, told Marketplace that since Walmart is the nation’s largest employer “its work force is bound to reflect the country’s current economic realities, including growing rates of food stamp use.” This statement passes the buck impressively, overlooking the role that Walmart has played in shaping the country’s current economic realities—in creating an America where millions of people who get up and go to work each day are nevertheless paid too little to feed themselves.
The truth is that Walmart and all the other large and profitable retailers, fast food companies, and other corporations that fatten their bottom line by letting the public feed their employees have made a business decision to shrink their payroll on the taxpayer’s dime. It’s up to us to decide whether to continue allowing them to do it.",blog
"States work to curb the financial background checks that can keep the unemployed out of work.
After two years of working in a temporary job as customer-service representative, Debra Banks was offered the job permanently. She was sent a hire letter, set a start date, and confirmed her new salary. But there was a hitch: To get the job, Banks had to undergo a credit check.
They wouldn't be strict, a company representative assured her; after all, Banks had already worked at the firm for two years and consistently received high praise for her work. But when the credit report came back showing unpaid bills from a recent hospitalization, the company rescinded the offer. Her contact at the staffing agency told her the bad credit report was to blame.
Banks returned to temp work, only to yet again be denied a permanent job because of her credit history. Then she was laid-off from the temp position as well. ""It made me feel worthless as a person,"" Banks confesses. ""Unfortunately my credit has not improved ... I haven't been able to get a job to improve it.""
Banks's case is hardly an isolated one. Today, six in ten employers say that they check the credit histories of some or all prospective employees before making final hiring decisions. This traps many jobseekers in what workplace advocate Nat Lippert describes as a devastating catch-22: They can't attain employment because of poor credit, yet they can't pay off bills and improve their credit without income from a job.
A growing number of states are also taking action to restrict the use of credit checks in employment. Hawaii, Illinois, Oregon, Washington, Maryland and Connecticut have passed legislation limiting the use of credit checks in hiring, firing, and promotions. More than 20 other states, including California, New York and Tennessee are considering bills. The moves are, in part, to help good employees like Banks get jobs they deserve, but also address a more fundamental problem: There's no real evidence that the practice is good for employers, either.
Companies justify the credit checks by saying they need some way to assess a job applicant's reliability and character. Credit checks have been aggressively marketed to employers by for-profit credit bureaus to do just that. Yet it's far from clear that running credit checks benefits employers. The only available rigorous study of employment credit checks concluded that there's no correlation between credit history and job performance. Even industry representatives admit this. Eric Rosenberg, Director of State Governmental Relations for TransUnion, one of the three major credit reporting agencies, conceded: ""...we don't have any research to show any statistical correlation between what's in somebody's credit report and their job performance or their likelihood to commit fraud.""
At the same time, employers may be exposing themselves to unexpected legal liability. African Americans and Hispanics - likely due to a variety of factors like higher poverty and unemployment rates, fewer assets, and a legacy of discrimination, including lending industry practices such as redlining-are disproportionately likely to have low credit scores. That means that excluding job candidates based on credit history disproportionately screens out people of color. The potential for bias is magnified by the fact that there are no accepted metrics for employers to assess a job applicant's credit report. Decisions are open to individual discretion and inadvertent bias.
Whether or not employers are intentionally trying to screen out people of color by using credit checks, they can be held accountable for the discriminatory effects. In 2010, Bank of America was found to have discriminated against African-Americans by using credit checks in the hiring process for entry-level employees. A similar lawsuit against Kaplan Higher Education Corporation filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is pending.
That states are taking action to curb the use of credit checks by employers shows a mounting political will to address the practice's unfairness, but the laws vary. So far, the credit-reporting industry has succeeded in lobbying for exemptions in every state ban. The result is that individuals who have poor credit are still shut out of employment in entire industries.
Even the strongest state laws, like those passed in Maryland in April or in Hawaii in 2009, allow credit checks on people applying for managerial positions or jobs in financial institutions. Maryland's law specifically states that employers can run credit checks for any employee that ""is provided an expense account or a corporate debit or credit card."" The idea is that a prospective employee's personal spending habits shed light on how responsibly they would handle a company's money. But such exemptions ignore the fact that poor credit may stem from causes - from costly medical procedures that were inadequately covered by insurance, to messy divorces where a former spouse leaves a consumer saddled with debt, or predatory lending schemes that lead to foreclosure - that have little do with a prospective employee's ability to be conscientious with the corporate credit card.
In Illinois, the exemptions are even more extensive. Employees of insurance companies, law enforcement agencies, and all local and state governments may still be subject to credit checks. Most troubling is a carve-out in both Illinois and Connecticut that permits credit checks in any case where a prospective employee has ""unsupervised access to cash or marketable assets valued at $2,500 or more."" With that loophole, anyone from bartenders to stockroom employees could be disqualified from work due to their credit history.
Stronger legislation is on tap at the federal level, where the Equal Employment for All Act sponsored by Representative Steve Cohen would ban employment-related credit checks except in narrow circumstances, such as positions requiring national security clearance. But with 32 exclusively Democratic co-sponsors, the bill is stuck in the Committee on Financial Services and stands little chance in the Republican-controlled House.
Ultimately litigation, like the suit against Kaplan, may have an even greater impact on employer behavior than exemption-riddled state laws. If high-profile employers are forced to pay costly damages for the racially discriminatory impact of screening potential employees' credit histories, other companies will take notice. The fear of expensive litigation and the attendant public relations fallout may be what it takes to make employers reevaluate hiring practices.
But for the millions of Americans with poor credit struggling to find or hold onto work, tearing down the credit check barrier can't happen soon enough.",media
"What differentiates households that accumulate and carry balances on their credit cards from those that don’t have debt? Building on a national survey of 1,997 households, this study examines two groups of working age low- and middle-income households that are statistically indistinguishable in terms of income, racial and ethnic background, age, marital status and rate of homeownership—yet one group carries credit card debt, while the other has credit cards but no debt.
Contrary to popular belief, we find little evidence that households with credit card debt are less responsible in their spending habits than households that do not have accumulated debt. Instead, we see that, among similarly situated low- and middle-income households of working age, factors like education, value of assets to fall back on, insurance coverage and whether a household member has lost a job are among the foremost predictors of whether a household will accumulate credit card debt.
Among working-age low- and middle-income households, key indicators of credit card debt include:
EDUCATION: Respondents with a college degree are 22 percent less likely to be carrying credit card debt than high school graduates.
LACK OF INSURANCE COVERAGE: Households in which a member has gone without health insurance at some point in the last three years are 20 percent more likely to be carrying credit card debt than households in which no one has been uninsured. 
CHILDREN: Households that include children under 18 years of age are 15 percent more likely to be carrying credit card debt than childless households. 
UNEMPLOYMENT: Households where someone has been unemployed for at least two months in the last three years are 14 percent more likely to be carrying credit card debt than households that were not hit by joblessness. 
SAVINGS AND HOME VALUE: The average household without credit card debt reports an amount of savings nearly three times times greater than the average household with credit card debt; meanwhile homeowners that have negative equity in their homes are 24 percent more likely to be carrying credit card debt.",research
"Today marks 95 years since the passage of the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote, and 44 years since Congress designated its anniversary Women’s Equality Day. This gives us the opportunity to consider how far we’ve come, how far we have to go, and envision what the world would look like if women attained full equality. I will leave a discussion of political equality to my colleagues working tirelessly in that mission, and focus on the economy.
Women make up almost half of all workers in America and working mothers are the primary breadwinners in 40 percent of the nation’s families, so economic equality would make an immense difference for families and the economy as a whole.
Just how immense? The Institute for Women’s Policy Research finds that if working women were paid the same as men of the same age with similar education and hours of work then the US economy would have produced additional income of $447.6 billion in 2014. The average incomes of families with a working woman would increase by $7,078 annually and poverty rates would fall dramatically. Equal pay for working women of color, who face a far larger pay gap than white women, would boost the average incomes of their families to a still greater extent.
To achieve this, lawmakers must enact policies to combat overt discrimination such as the Paycheck Fairness Act and the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. But that’s not enough. We must also uproot the structural factors that prevent women from pursuing and attaining the same career opportunities as men.
Since women are more likely to leave the workforce or scale back on employment to care for children, elderly parents, or other loved ones in need, paid leave is a critical reform to boost family incomes and enable women to remain attached to the workforce. The catch is that to fully benefit women without imposing a stigma that could backfire on women’s wages and employment, leave policies must be crafted so that men have incentives to take advantage of them as well. In other words, an America where women are equal is one where men also have greater opportunity to cuddle their babies and be present for their aging parents—roles that growing numbers of millennial men say they crave but have difficulty achieving.   
At the same time, while it is entirely legitimate (and quite important) to ask why there aren’t more female executives at the nation’s largest companies and partners at top law firms, women’s equality also demands that we work for a world where the jobs that employ a majority of women are no longer so poorly paid.
It is unacceptable that early childhood teachers—increasingly recognized as critical to children’s development—still earn wages too low to live on, and see little or no increase in wages when they have greater educational attainment. Similarly, it’s intolerable that minimum wage and overtime pay standards that apply to other employees still have not been extended to home care workers, a workforce overwhelmingly made up of women of color. Strategies that target poor conditions in these and other disproportionately female occupations are needed, as are those that increase women’s opportunities in higher-paid, male-dominated jobs.
In the meantime, policies that lift up working people in general—from raising the minimum wage and the tipped minimum wage to improving overtime pay and expanding the ability to join unions—wind up providing substantial benefits to working women and are a key part of achieving equality.

"“I went through four interviews and everything went smoothly. I was on my way to the orientation program [for my new job] when I got a call on my cell phone: they had to cancel my orientation because there was a discrepancy in my credit report. . .” 
I’ve written about employment credit checks in this space before, considering how personal credit reports -- originally developed as a tool for lenders to determine who is most likely to pay back a loan -- have never been proven accurate for employment purposes. Employment credit checks can have a racially discriminatory impact and may invade personal privacy, inadvertently revealing details about medical history and disability status that our laws are meant to protect. Finally, despite the frequency of errors in credit reports, the process of eliminating mistakes is labyrinthine.
But these dry facts only tell part of the story: the other side comes out in the stories of qualified people, like Gustavo Panezo, quoted above, who have been shut out of jobs they could perform admirably simply because of their credit. A series of video testimonials compiled by NEDAP puts a face and voice to the New Yorkers who were denied work because of their personal credit. Watch below:

Why New Yorkers specifically? While the problem of employment credit checks is national, New York City and State have each recently introduced legislation that would be the strongest in the country, outlawing the use of credit checks for employment purposes except as otherwise required by law.
Right now, New York City’s “Stop Credit Discrimination in Employment Act,” sponsored by Councilman Brad Lander, has particular momentum. The bill has a veto-proof majority of 34 co-sponsors and dozens of community organizations have signed on in support.
In an editorial this spring, the New York Times decried the existence of a “Credit History Underclass”   and noted that “The interest around this issue shows that more lawmakers are starting to realize how this unfair practice damages the lives and job prospects of millions of people. The sooner they act to end it, the better.”",blog
"Dramatic new public policy initiatives are needed to ensure that all Americans have a chance to move into the middle class and to ensure greater security for those already in the middle class.
Widely shared middle-class prosperity is a signature of American society. It has made America the most hopeful and dynamic country on earth and it is a foundation of strong democracy.
Yet today, America’s middle class is in trouble—and those troubles long preceded the financial crash of 2008 and the downturn that followed. As a result of major economic and policy changes over the past three decades, the traditional routes into the middle class have become more difficult to travel and security has eroded for those already in the middle class. Many jobs do not pay enough to cover basic living expenses, much less allow workers to save money and build assets for the future. In fact, a quarter of full-time working-age adults are still not earning enough money to meet economic needs like housing, utilities, food, health care, and transportation for themselves or their families.
A college education has become ever more critical to moving up the income ladder—even as it has also become less affordable and the earning power of a college degree has stagnated. Building significant wealth assets for retirement or to help the next generation remains an impossible dream for millions. Many households are instead mired in debt. In short, too many people who play by the rules and do everything right find that they cannot climb into the middle class—or stay there.
The hard economic times of the past few years have compounded the long accumulating challenges facing the middle class. Jobs are harder to come by amid extended high unemployment. Many jobs lost during the recession may never come back as a result of corporate policies that have eliminated jobs, moved them overseas, or replaced people with technology. The nation’s new jobs disproportionately offer lower wages and fewer benefits than those they replaced.
The dream of homeownership has turned into a nightmare for millions of Americans who have lost their homes to foreclosure or now find themselves owing more on their mortgages than their homes are worth. Retirement savings accounts were hit hard by the stock market plunge of 2008-2009. Government investments in education and job training have declined amid draconian budget cuts and hundreds of thousands of once secure jobs in the public sector have been eliminated.
America’s economy has been an awesome engine of wealth creation in the past thirty years, but the new prosperity has disproportionately gone to the wealthiest. Between 1979 and 2007, according to the Congressional Budget Office, American households in the highest-paid 1 percent of the income distribution saw after-tax income gains of 275 percent—while the 60 percent of the households in the middle saw their incomes grow by just under 40 percent over this same period. And, according to much research, social mobility – the very essence of the American idea – has stagnated or declined in the United States, with many young people struggling to replicate their parents’ standard of living. For example, young men are earning 10 cents per dollar less than their fathers did 30 years ago, according to research from Demos. A persistent and growing racial wealth gap, with historic inequities and injustices exacerbated by the recent iniquity of predatory lending, restricts opportunity for people of color to join or remain part of the nation’s middle class. Princeton economist Alan Krueger observes that the economic data “challenge the notion that the United States is an exceptionally mobile society. If the United States stands out in comparison with other countries, it is in having a more static distribution of income across generations with fewer opportunities for advancement.”
A host of public policy choices created this state of affairs – including tax cuts that disproportionately benefitted the wealthy, financial deregulation, state divestment in public higher education, and decisions to let the minimum wage stagnate, to name only a few – and things are likely to get worse without major policy corrections. The long-term trends that have moved America toward a postindustrial service economy are here to stay and, in fact, have accelerated during the economic downturn. Over the next two decades, the Department of Labor projects that the largest job growth will be in low-wage jobs offering little opportunity for advancement and that do not offer health insurance or pay enough to allow workers to put money toward home equity and retirement savings. Meanwhile, most of the good jobs that are created will require a post-secondary education that is likely to remain out of reach for millions as college tuition costs continue to rise.
Even as structural changes have imperiled the middle class, national action has been lacking. Over recent decades, many political leaders have failed to reckon with a basic fact of the new economic era – for millions of Americans, no amount of individual effort or self-improvement or thrift can guarantee a secure middle-class life. The American social contract – a promise of opportunity and security for those who act responsibly – is fundamentally broken.
Dramatic new public policy initiatives are needed to accomplish two broad interrelated goals: to ensure that all Americans have a chance to move into the middle class and, second, to ensure greater security for those in the middle class. Such initiatives must move far beyond incremental measures and be of sufficient scale to permanently address the economic insecurities of what is now a vast number of U.S. households.

"House Majority Leader Eric Cantor really cares about working families. He favors “common sense legislation to protect workers and make life work for more people” and wants to “help working parents who are juggling responsibilities at home and on the job.” 
That’s why Cantor is throwing his support behind H.R. 1286, the Healthy Families Act, which would follow the lead of San Francisco, New York City, Seattle, Portland OR, Washington D.C., the state of Connecticut and 145 countries around the world that guarantee working people paid time off the job to cope with illness. He wants to raise the minimum wage to help 30 million working Americans make ends meet.  And he’s ready to champion paid family leave, too.
In our dreams.
Back in waking reality, Cantor is pushing a bill that wraps itself in family-friendly rhetoric while actually stripping workers of their ability to get paid for overtime work. The name of the bill, Judith Warner notes in Time Magazine, is downright treacherous: it’s called the Working Families Flexibility Act. As Brenden Timpe has noted, the bill aids employers, not workers. And yes, the House is scheduled to vote on it this week.  

Writing for The Hill, Eileen Applebaum, an economist with the Center for Economic Policy Research details what the comp time bill would really do:
Its major effect would be to hamstring workers – likely increasing overtime hours for those who don’t want them and cutting pay for those who do. The proposed legislation undermines the 40-hour work week that workers have long relied on to give them time to spend with their kids. The flexibility in this comp time bill would have employees working unpaid overtime hours beyond the 40-hour workweek and accruing as many as 160 hours of compensatory time. A low-paid worker making $10 an hour who accrued that much comp time in lieu of overtime pay would effectively give his or her employer an interest-free loan of $1,600 – equal to a month’s pay. That’s a lot to ask of a worker making about $20,000 a year. Indeed, any worker who accrues 160 hours of comp time will in effect have loaned his or her employer a month’s pay. This same arithmetic provides employers with a powerful incentive to increase workers’ overtime hours. Instead of having to pay time-and-a-half wages when an hourly-paid employee works longer than the standard 40-hour work week, the employer incurs no financial cost at the time the extra hours are worked.
As if that weren’t bad enough, the legislation would actually stifle job creation. Instead of hiring more employees as the economy recovers, the bill would give businesses new incentives to pile extra overtime hours onto current employees.
As we’ve documented frequently on this blog, work hours are a major concern for low-wage workers – and the rest of us. Retail workers struggle to get by on unstable schedules with constantly shifting working hours. Forty million Americans, including two out of three low-wage workers in the U.S. don’t have a single paid sick day off work. And too many of us are striving for every extra paid hour we can get as wages have remained flat at a time of record profits. The problems are real and could be addressed by policy, but they need real solutions, not the cynical ploys to deprive workers of the few remaining rights on the job.",blog
"Demos’ new briefing book, Everyone’s Economy, offers an economic agenda that will enable all of us to thrive. Women’s History Month is an opportunity to dig into the ways that a race-conscious, populist economic agenda must elevate women. Over the next 2 weeks, Demos will share a series of blog posts that explore different ways that policy can impact women’s economic opportunity and stability. Today, we look at how raising job standards lifts up women.
Women work hard, and that should be enough to sustain our families. Yet even as corporate profits grow, millions of women (especially women of color) disproportionately work at low-paying jobs with unstable schedules, no paid sick time, and vulnerability to wage theft. Our workplaces have been pulled out of balance by rules that unfairly favor corporations and the rich. Today, as women and people of color make up a growing share of America’s working class, employers are weakening job standards for all working people.
Deteriorating job quality impacts every person who works, while often hitting women of color in low-paid jobs the hardest. Americans working as cashiers, cooks, home care and child care workers, restaurant servers, hotel housekeepers, nursing assistants and many other predominantly female occupations find their paychecks falling short of basic needs. Low standards in these jobs are often rooted in sexist assumptions about women’s work being less valuable than men’s. Wage theft, unstable schedules, denial of overtime pay, and a lack of paid sick time further degrade jobs and force women and their families to struggle.
Working women deserve a fair return on our work and a decent life for our families. Policymakers should raise the standards for American jobs for all working Americans. Bills before Congress now would raise the minimum wage; guarantee stable, predictable schedules; allow working people to accrue paid sick days (particularly important for women as they are more likely to take time to care for sick children and other family); prevent wage theft and help workers fight back against it; stop businesses from misclassifying their employees as independent contractors; and restore overtime pay laws so that working women (and men) are paid for all the work they do.

"In almost every Nissan auto plant across the world, workers are represented by a union. One exception is the facility in Canton, Mississippi, where Nissan management is bitterly opposing efforts by its predominantly African-American employees to join the United Auto Workers union. The campaign will culminate next week, when approximately 3,500 Nissan employees in Canton will vote on union representation.
Affirming that “workers’ rights are civil rights,” employees at the Canton plant maintain that the company has failed to respect their dignity. Despite the lucrative tax incentives offered to lure Nissan to Canton, the company has staffed its plant with large numbers of temporary workers who lack job security and receive less pay and benefits than Nissan’s regular employees doing the same work. Even when former contract workers have been hired by the company directly, they remain on a lower pay scale, producing an unfair, two-tiered system.
Workers also raise concerns about safety and the ability to speak up about unsafe conditions without fear of retaliation. The Nissan plant in Canton has been cited by OSHA for serious violations of workplace safety rules.
With the support of the NAACP and other civil rights organizations, as well as local clergy and community groups, Congressman Benny Thompson, Senator Bernie Sanders, and actor Danny Glover, workers are standing up against what they say is a campaign of intimidation by management aimed at scaring them away from joining the union. Workers report being forced to attend anti-union meetings with supervisors, the harassment of pro-union employees, and illegal threats to close the plant if workers make the decision to join the union. The company denies allegations of illegal behavior. Union activists at the plant, many the children of civil rights activists, look to the local black community’s long history of standing up to oppression and intimidation.
Throughout the last presidential campaign, manufacturing jobs were held up as the cornerstone of American prosperity. Candidate Donald Trump claimed that the middle class would flourish under new trade deals aimed at reclaiming “stolen” factory jobs. Yet this analysis overlooks why American manufacturing jobs historically provided the type of stable, well-paid employment that helped to build the American middle class: not because of a magic ingredient inherent in manufacturing work, but because industrial workers built power through unions to demand and win a better deal on the job. The benefits of union membership have been especially significant for black workers, reducing racial wage disparities.
Today, in manufacturing as elsewhere, workers’ rights and power to negotiate are under attack. The National Employment Law Project documents declining pay in manufacturing, pointing out that although manufacturing workers once earned a wage significantly higher than the U.S. average, by 2013 the average factory worker made 7.7 percent below the median wage for all occupations, with a particularly steep wage decline in the automotive sector. The use of temporary workers, like those at Nissan’s Canton plant, have helped to accelerate the decline in pay and job quality.
In fact, lower wages and a compliant workforce are major factors drawing manufacturers like Nissan to a largely non-union state like Mississippi. Next week’s vote will help to determine whether manufacturing workers can reverse the downward trend in wages, power and respect.
Veteran labor reporter Mike Elk makes the case that “if the union vote is successful, it would be the largest union victory in Mississippi in more than a generation. A win in Canton would send a bolt of energy into the growing labor movement across the south.”",blog
"The consumer advocates at the Center for Responsible Lending don’t mince words: “overdraft ‘protection’ is a racket; not a service.” CRL explains:
Transaction shuffling and multiple, exorbitant fees for small shortfalls in their checking accounts cost Americans billions per year in unfair fees. More than half of Americans are now living paycheck-to-paycheck, making a majority of U.S. families vulnerable to bank overdraft practices that are exceedingly misnamed “overdraft protection.”
In effect, overdraft “protection” products can become like payday loans, with high fees substituting for high interest, and consumers at risk of getting caught in a cycle of debt they cannot emerge from. But as toxic as overdraft products can be for consumers, they are highly lucrative for banks. In fact, according to a recent Wall Street Journal investigation,  some banks make a disproportionate amount of their income relative to overall deposits from overdraft and other fees. Many of these high fee stores turn out to be banks with a heavy presence inside Wal-Mart stores. According to the Wall Street Journal, the five banks with the most Wal-Mart branches were among the top 10 U.S. banks ranked by fee income as a percentage of deposits in 2013.
Walmart customers, many living paycheck to paycheck, are exactly the people most vulnerable to the cycle of abusive, high-cost credit offered by overdraft products. What’s more, as the Wall Street Journal’s profile of a Cleveland-area banking customer suggests, the fact that the bank is located inside a store known for its low prices may contribute to the misperception that fees represent some sort of a bargain, when in fact they may approach the cost of a payday loan. A Walmart spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal that the company: “has a ""very thorough process"" for vetting banks to which it leases store space, to ensure ""they're in line with Wal-Mart's philosophy of saving customers money."" Yet the Center for Responsible Lending warns:
Many financial institutions use abusive overdraft programs to unfairly drain their customers’ checking accounts, putting consumers on a treadmill of high-cost credit. Abusive overdraft programs drive consumers out of the banking system; indeed, they are the leading reason consumers lose their checking accounts. Overdraft programs also crowd out better products by removing incentives for banks to offer lower-cost, manageable ways to deal with financial shortfalls.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which found ""wide variations across financial institutions regarding the costs and risks of opting in to overdraft coverage"" in a study last year, is considering new regulations of overdraft products. In the meantime: buyer beware—especially if you bank at Walmart.",blog
"Alissa Vladimir contributed to this post.
On Tuesday, the Ohio state legislature passed a law to ban abortion as soon as a fetal heartbeat can be detected, as early as six weeks after pregnancy. If signed by the governor, the law will not only be the most extreme abortion prohibition in the U.S. – an unconstitutional threat to women’s health and bodily integrity – it would also be a tremendous blow to the economic security of American families.
Six weeks after conception, many women do not yet realize they are pregnant. Tests that might reveal serious fetal abnormalities or severe threats to the health of a mother cannot be performed until weeks or months later. The proposed law has no exceptions for cases of rape or incest. Its stated rationale relies on distorted science.
This attack on women’s health and freedom is clear. But the ways in which the proposed ban – and other less radical restrictions on reproductive rights – constitutes an assault on working families has been less thoroughly explored.
Having a child is one of life’s most serious commitments, economically and otherwise. Without the ability to decide whether and when to become a parent, families’ economic security is always in jeopardy. An unintended pregnancy can upend financial stability, making it difficult for mothers to pursue education and maintain employment. Indeed, many women seeking abortions have low incomes and are already mothers, reporting that they were seeking to terminate a pregnancy because they could not afford to have a child. Yet obtaining an abortion is also costly, leading many women to face weeks of delay arranging for funding and transportation before they can obtain the procedure. As is the intention, a six-week ban would make access to abortion impossible for these women.
The Reproductive Health Technologies Project’s analysis of data on women turned away from clinics finds that women denied an abortion are substantially more likely to be in poverty two years later than those who received the care they needed:
At the time they presented at a clinic, the women turned away from the abortion care they sought were on similar socio-economic footing with the women who obtained abortions. However, two years later, according to preliminary analysis, women denied an abortion had three times greater odds of ending up below the federal poverty line, adjusting for any previous differences between the two groups.
It’s no accident that the same Ohio legislature enacting draconian abortion restrictions is also moving to disrupt the ability of city and county governments to raise their local minimum wages or implement local laws on fair scheduling in the workplace. Higher wages and sustainable schedules make it less arduous for working parents to care and provide for their children. Ohio has also slashed funding for health programs aimed at new mothers and their babies. Together, these measures radically restrict the ability of working Ohioans to support their families and attain economic stability.
Next week, Demos will release a report that further explores the economic constraints facing American parents, including the ways that restricted reproductive rights trap women and their families. We wish these findings were not so destructively dramatized by current events.",blog
"Demos submits the following comments strongly supporting the proposed Department of Labor (Department) rule to amend Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)  regulations by extending minimum wage and overtime premium pay to nearly 1.8 million low-wage home care workers.  Demos is a non-partisan, non-profit policy research organization focused on rebuilding pathways to a more diverse middle class, and increasing democratic participation. This proposed rule will help lift hard-working Americans closer to the middle class, ensuring fair pay for women, especially women of color.   
With this rule, the Department of Labor will affirm the principle that all working people deserve basic work protections. At the same time, by effectively raising pay for some of the nation’s lowest wage workers, primarily women who will quickly spend any additional income to support their families, the proposed rule will provide a boost to the economy, promoting economic recovery for the nation as a whole.
More than nine out of ten workers in the rapidly growing home care industry are women, disproportionately women of color. Many of these women are primary income earners for their families who struggle to survive on median annual wages of less than $21,000 for full-time work, less than the Federal Poverty Guideline for a family of four.  Home care workers provide a lifeline for the elderly and people with disabilities – yet for decades, their stressful and physically demanding jobs have come without the basic protections of the federal minimum wage and overtime laws. Extending the protections of the FLSA to a field heavily dominated by women will help these women lift their families out of poverty and reduce ongoing pay disparities between women and men. 
While cost considerations would not justify the continued denial of legal rights to home care workers, we note that the cost of extending FLSA protections to home care workers is manageable. Sixteen states already require both minimum wage and overtime pay for most home health workers who would otherwise be excluded under current regulations. The national cost of the proposed change is estimated to amount to less than one-tenth of one percent of the home care industry’s $84 billion in annual revenue.  With thousands of third party agencies now employing roughly 70 percent of workers in the industry, the proposed rule’s extension of FLSA protections to home care workers employed by third parties is vitally important.
Moreover, providing wage and hour protections to home care workers will have benefits for the industry and consumers as well as for the workers themselves. There is a high rate of turnover in the home care field, mainly caused by low wages, insufficient hours, and lack of reimbursement for travel costs. High turnover disrupts continuity and quality of care for customers and places great financial burdens on agencies and state and federal governments. By increasing wages, encouraging more even distribution of work hours, and requiring reimbursement for travel costs, the proposed rule will reduce turnover and promote better outcomes for both home care workers and the individuals and families they serve.
We applaud the Department for proposing regulations that will finally extend basic legal protections to home care workers who for too long have been underpaid and undervalued.  Demos greatly appreciates this opportunity to comment.

"How Walmart has wielded its market power to change the face of American industry and lower labor standards in the retail sector
UPDATE: Read the Demos study on the retail sector at large and how low wages impact workers and the economy. 
Why is it that America no longer makes things the way we used to? Between 1980 and 2011, the United States lost 7 million manufacturing jobs,1 many of them middle-class positions that enabled workers to support their families with dignity. Today, the nation’s largest employer is not a manufacturer, but mega-retailer Walmart – which is celebrating its 50th anniversary this week. Walmart pays its associates just $8.81 an hour on average.2 In this economy, a quarter of full-time working-age American adults are not earning enough money to meet their families’ economic needs.3 While the decline of American industry was caused by a variety of complex factors, the actions of the nation’s biggest corporation and largest retailer play an under-estimated role. 
As America’s biggest company, Walmart wields tremendous market power. Walmart could use this might to help build up the American economy, offering good jobs to its own employees, encouraging contractors to do the same, and helping to strengthen U.S. manufacturing through its relationships with its suppliers. Instead, Walmart has wielded its market power to eliminate good-paying manufacturing jobs and lower labor standards in the retail sector and throughout its entire supply chain.
 
The vast majority of merchandise Walmart sells in the U.S. is manufactured abroad. The company searches the world for the cheapest goods possible, and this usually means buying from low-wage factories overseas.  Walmart boasts of direct relationships with nearly 20,000 Chinese suppliers,4 and purchased $27 billion worth of Chinese-made goods in 2006.5 According to the Economic Policy Institute, Walmart’s trade with China alone eliminated 133,000 U.S. manufacturing jobs between 2001 and 2006 and accounted for 11.2 percent of the nation’s total job loss due to trade.6 But China is hardly the only source of Walmart goods: the company also imports from Bangladesh, Honduras, Cambodia, and a host of other countries.
With $419 billion in annual net sales, Walmart’s market power is so immense that the even the largest suppliers must comply with its demands for lower and lower prices because they cannot afford to have their goods taken off its shelves. Companies that used to manufacture products in the United States, from Levi’s jeans to lock maker Master Lock, were pressured to shut their U.S. factories and moved manufacturing abroad to meet Walmart’s demand for low prices.7
Walmart was a leader in sourcing goods overseas, establishing a centralized purchasing system, technological infrastructure, and linkages to foreign factories that other companies imitated and built on.  While researchers find that Walmart still imports disproportionately more goods than other apparel retailers,8 its innovations accelerated the use of offshore suppliers by its competitors, speeding the loss of American manufacturing jobs.
Even when Walmart products are made in the United States, manufacturing jobs still get eliminated as suppliers cut costs to meet Walmart’s demands for low prices. A spokesman for the National Knitwear and Sportswear Association noted that producing goods for Walmart “forces domestic manufacturers to compete, often unrealistically, with foreign suppliers who pay their help pennies on the hour.”9  A Walmart spokesperson admitted that this was the point of the company’s efforts to buy domestic goods: “one of our big objectives was to put the heat on American manufacturers to lower prices.”10 Even as manufacturing costs increase, Walmart demands that suppliers’ prices go even lower, a dynamic that helped push Kraft Foods to plan the closure of 39 factories and lay off 13,500 workers.11 
Layoffs aren’t the only way manufacturers contrive to meet the low prices Walmart demands. Walmart’s domestic suppliers lower wages, cut benefits, aggressively fight employee efforts to unionize and bargain collectively, and skimp on worker comfort and safety. For example, Louisiana seafood processor C.J.’s Seafood, which sells an estimated 85 percent of its processed crawfish to Walmart, has recently come under scrutiny for allegedly abusing employees working in the U.S. on temporary immigrant visas (known as guestworker visas).12 A complaint to the U.S. Department of Labor claims that the Walmart supplier “engaged in extremely coercive employment related actions, including forcing guestworkers to work up to 24-hour shifts with no overtime pay, locking guestworkers in the plant to force them to continue to work, threatening the guestworkers with beatings to make them work faster, and threatening violence against the guestworkers’ families in Mexico after workers contacted law enforcement for assistance.”13
6. Squeezing U.S. manufacturers out of business.
Walmart’s unrelenting push for low prices eats into the profit margins of its U.S. suppliers, often weakening companies in the process. Journalist Charles Fishman provides a vivid example: Walmart provided 30 percent of Vlasic Pickles’ overall business and insisted that if the company did not allow Walmart to sell a gallon jar of pickles for the ruinously low price of $2.97, they would stop buying Vlasic’s other products. “The pickle maker had spent decades convincing consumers that they should pay a premium for its brand. Now Walmart was practically giving them away.”14 According to Fishman, Vlasic’s profit margin from pickles shrunk 25 percent or more.  Nor is Vlasic alone in seeing its business cannibalized by Walmart: of the top ten companies supplying Walmart in 1994, four sought bankruptcy protection by 2006.15
By squeezing its suppliers, Walmart leaves companies without the resources to make new investments in research and development. And once companies become dependent on Walmart as a massive purchaser, their greatest incentive is to keep producing the products Walmart has decided to sell, making it unnecessary and unprofitable to innovate.
If discount retailers like Target and Kmart want to remain competitive with Walmart, they must demand similarly low prices from suppliers. As a result, the pressures pushing down costs and propelling the elimination of American manufacturing jobs are magnified.
According to the non-profit Center for Responsive Politics, Walmart spent $7.8 million on lobbying in 2011 alone.16 While this money was paid to influence a range of legislation, from promoting corporate tax cuts to opposing a bill to guarantee paid sick time to working people, trade policy was among the issues Walmart lobbied on most aggressively. In fact, Walmart has lobbied to make it easier to push American jobs out of the country for years, playing a key role in in lobbying for NAFTA in the early 1990s.17
Walmart has set the template for today’s economy: one in which increased economic productivity is not shared with working people, and the vast inequality that this creates is seen as normal. Today the six members of the Walton family who inherited the Walmart fortune enjoy wealth equal to that of the least-wealthy 30 percent of Americans combined.18 These billionaires are the ultimate beneficiaries of Walmart’s push to cut costs, condemning retail employees to work in poverty and American factory workers to unemployment.
Walmart is the nation’s largest employer and one of America’s most profitable companies, netting $15.7 billion in profits in 2011.19 With the great resources at its disposal, Walmart could afford to take the high road, supporting good manufacturing jobs in America by allowing for higher wages and more investment in its supply chain and paying its own employees – from retail “associates” to warehouse workers and cleaning contractors – a living wage. That would set the template for a new American economy, one in which Americans might once again “make things” and also find greater dignity and stability in selling them.",policy-briefs
"Mother’s Day was a couple of weeks ago, but Americans need another day to think about what we owe to moms. May 30th is a less festive occasion: It’s Moms’ Equal Pay Day, a date indicating how far into 2018 mothers have to work to catch up with what fathers were paid back in 2017. In other words, today underscores the reality that mothers must work a full 5 months longer than fathers to provide the same support to their families. The pay inequity harms mothers, their partners, children and everyone else who relies on a mother’s income for all or part of their household’s needs.
In our 2016 report The Parent Trap, my Demos colleagues and I quantified the plunge in income associated with having a child too young for public school. After controlling for differences in age, partnership status, education, and race, we found that the drop in income associated with having a young child amounts to $14,850 a year for households with two adults. For women who become single mothers, household income declines a staggering 36 percent. The high cost of child care and a lack of paid leave to care for a baby is responsible for much of the decline: Mothers who live with a partner and were paid low wages are the most likely to leave the workforce when a baby is born.
Yet it’s not all about taking time out of the workforce. Researchers have revealed a “motherhood penalty” as mothers in the paid workforce face discrimination “in the form of lower perceived competence and commitment, higher professional expectations, lower likelihood of hiring and promotion, and lower recommended salaries,” according to Cornell University scholars Shelley J. Correll, Stephen Benard, and In Paik.  While fathers see a pay bonus after becoming parents, mothers’ pay takes a hit.  For mothers of color, the income penalty associated with having a child is compounded by racial discrimination that further reduces pay.
We owe far more to our mothers. Our recent briefing book, Everyone’s Economy, lifted up a range of policies—including many bills already pending before Congress—that would cut the motherhood penalty and help to equalize pay. Policymakers should:
Enacting these policies would be a giant step toward workplace parity for mothers, fathers, and all working people.",blog

just a few weeks after starting in my new position the company fired me because my debt-to-credit ratio was too high. I later learned that 60% of employers now check credit reports, which typically include student debts. How are you supposed to pay off your student debts if you can’t get (or keep) a job BECAUSE of your debts? And what do my student debts have to do with my ability to do a job well anyway?
Horton channeled her frustration not only to her former bosses, but toward the corporations relentlessly hawking credit reports to employers. In April, she launched a petition on Change.org calling on credit reporting giant TransUnion to stop selling credit reports to employers. Her plight resonated: within just a week, the petition accumulated more than 40,000 signatures and is still gaining rapidly. The appeal mirrors one signed by more than two dozen civil rights, fair employment and consumer groups (including Demos) asking TransUnion to discontinue its sale of employment credit reports due to their discriminatory impact, lack of validity in predicting job performance, and the frequency of errors.
But the petitions also point to a larger reason to oppose employment credit checks: they serve as an illegitimate barrier to people finding work. Horton points out that Penny Pritzker, TransUnion’s Chair and partial owner, sits on President Obama’s Jobs and Competitiveness Council, which advises the President on putting Americans back to work. It’s ironic, Horton notes, that someone is “advis[ing] on national job creation when her company sells products that may keep qualified people out of work.”
Why has Horton’s petition proven so popular? The idea that student debt would disqualify someone for employment strikes at the heart of America’s fundamental belief in opportunity. The United States has historically been a nation of self-improvers where those who make the effort to invest in their own future -- especially through education -- garner rewards for doing so. If low-income students who must borrow to afford a college education are then shut out of jobs because of their student debt, we are one step closer to a society in which only the already-privileged can access opportunity.
A seemingly trivial human resources practice -- running credit checks on job applicants and employees -- becomes the mechanism for tremendous discrimination and denial of opportunity.",blog
"Are you breathing a sigh of relief, job applicants? If a prospective employer runs a background check prior to hiring you, the chances they’ll falsely learn that you’re an armed robber, “a sex offender who [is] in prison at the time” or something similarly misleading are “less than 10 percent” according to an attorney for the National Association of Background Screening Professionals. 
That heartening statistic comes courtesy of an investigative report on this morning’s Today show, which finds that flawed background checks are causing innocent people to lose jobs, just as error-ridden credit reports do. Peddling criminal checks and credit reports to employers together simply compounds the opportunities for mistakes that can derail job searches and effectively destroy careers.
High error rates in credit reports and criminal background checks alike could be reduced by industry, of course, but as consumer attorney Jim Francis explains, “they would have to spend money on personnel and instituting procedures, which would carve into their profits.” In the meantime, you’re left with a credit reporting system in which “Americans are left virtually powerless to erase the mistakes” and background check system in which errors may get fixed long after the job in question is lost.
The industry’s lack of accountability for errors cries out for public oversight and regulation – so it’s encouraging that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  and Federal Trade Commission are taking action to rein them in.
But as I looked at the Today show’s image of “innocent” Catherine Taylor, the white, middle-aged stay-at-home mother who had her file mixed up with the “other” Catherine Taylor – this one a black woman of the same age who reportedly had repeat drug offenses on her record – it was powerfully clear that the problems with the employment background check and credit check industries go beyond the need for greater accuracy. Are we so certain it would have been just to deny the job to the “other” Catherine Taylor, assuming she was otherwise qualified?

With our criminal justice system profoundly marked by racial bias and personal credit histories shaped by a legacy of discrimination in lending, housing and employment; even error-free credit checks and criminal background checks can be mechanisms that reinforce racial discrimination, ensuring, as the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law that “old arrests and minor convictions can turn into life sentences of joblessness.”
That’s why it’s critical that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has taken action on criminal background checks – not only to ensure their accuracy, but to provide guidance ensuring that they aren’t used in a discriminatory fashion. As I’ve argued before, similar guidance is needed on employment credit checks.",blog
"Under New York’s proposed paid family leave law, businesses won’t pay anything for the new family leave benefit. The program would be funded entirely by a small payroll deduction from each worker in the state. An insurance provider will pay the benefits out to workers.
It’s certainly not the most progressive way to fund a new public benefit, but one thing it’s not is a burden on businesses.
In fact, it’s a benefit.
As David Bolotsky, CEO of the Brooklyn-based small business Uncommon Goods, wrote in a recent op-ed:
Anyone who runs a business knows that their most valuable asset is their team. Losing good employees is costly. Just hiring and training a replacement can cost thousands, not to mention the lost productivity when the position is unfilled. Furthermore, not offering benefits like paid leave makes it more difficult to attract and retain capable employees… we’d like to see paid leave be the law of the land. That’s why we support legislation that would expand paid family leave to all American employees. Some in Congress say that it would place an undue burden on business. Our experience shows the opposite: Paid leave is a wise investment, both for businesses and the country.
The experience of states that have enacted paid family leave backs Bolotsky up. Consider California, which was the first state to establish a paid family leave system in 2002.
In a survey of California businesses conducted by the Center for Economic Policy Research, 91 percent of companies with fewer than 50 employees reported the paid family leave law had no negative effect on the company’s profitability and performance.  88.8 percent said the law had no negative effect on employee productivity. Overall 87 percent of California employers say they experienced no cost increases associated with the law, while 9 percent say their costs were reduced, often when the company shifted from running its own paid leave program to the public system.
A key business benefit that emerged in California was the same trend Bolotsky identifies: the powerful effect on employee retention. Use of paid family leave greatly increased the likelihood that workers would return to the same employer after leave. The effort to retain valued employees is a key reason some of the nation’s most dynamic companies—most recently New York-based Etsy—have dramatically enhanced their provision of paid leave. Yet left to themselves many small businesses are unable to offer the generous paid leave benefits some bigger firms provide, putting them at a disadvantage when it comes to attracting and retaining workers.
With no cost to companies and substantial benefits, business leaders have spoken out in support of paid leave in New York. The politicians now calling to exclude small companies—and their employees—from a system that functions best when it is universal should listen to voices like Bolotsky's and ensure that everyone can participate in New York's paid family leave system.",blog
"Encouraging though it may be, last Friday’s strong jobs report doesn’t change the big picture: the economic recovery, officially underway since June 2009, is still leaving millions of working Americans behind. Today, a new report from the Alliance for a Just Society highlights the failure of our economic policies to produce the full-time living wage jobs working people need to sustain their families.
Report author Allyson Fredericksen finds that in 2014, 17.7 million job seekers (including both the unemployed and workers seeking a different job) pursued just 5 million job openings, leaving almost 13 million job seekers excluded from employment. But for many, even landing a job was not enough to make ends meet: of those 5 million job openings, nearly half paid less than $15 per hour, leaving only 2.7 million that paid $15 or more per hour. And for workers able to secure only part-time employment, wages were even more inadequate: in 2014, more than one in five part-time workers wanted full-time employment but were unable to find it.
The core finding: there are not enough living wage jobs to go around. And women and people of color are especially impacted by low wages and part-time work.
At Demos, we’ve looked closely at two large, low-paying industries – retail and fast food—and we’ve found that continued economic recovery and growth will not be sufficient to produce well-paying employment. The new AJS report reaches the same conclusion, finding that the fastest growing occupations tend to pay low wages and offer part-time, often erratic and unpredictable schedules.
To change this trajectory, and promote good jobs that enable people working hard to sustain their families and communities, we need to change public policy. Legislation to increase the minimum wage, support labor organizing and collective bargaining, and better regulate scheduling practices are among the measures that would permit workers scrambling to make ends meet with “a patchwork of paychecks” to attain economic security.",blog
"Dear Commissioners Salas, Agarwal, and Malalis:
Demos appreciates the opportunity to offer testimony on the state of workers’ rights in New York City. We are a non-partisan public policy organization working for an America where we all have an equal say in our democracy and an equal chance in our economy. We are a national organization proud to be based here in New York City. And we recognize that workers’ rights are critical to our mission of reducing economic inequality.
Our testimony will focus on four key areas of concern for working New Yorkers:
Addressing concerns on each of these fronts will require resources for legal enforcement, public education and outreach, and research to improve understanding of conditions for working New Yorkers and the efficacy of the city’s efforts at redress.  Dēmos welcomes the establishment of New York City’s Office of Labor Policy and Standards to serve as the city's focal point on workplace issues and we appreciate the continuing efforts of the Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs and the New York City Commission on Human Rights in combatting discrimination.
Widespread violations of basic wage and hour laws
Research into violations of basic employment laws reveals the critical importance of enforcing wage statutes, both for low-paid New Yorkers and for our city and its overall economy. The National Employment Law Project’s landmark 2008 survey of thousands of people employed in low-paying industries in New York City exposed pervasive violations of workplace protections: more than half of workers surveyed reported being subjected to pay violations such as failure to pay minimum wage, not being paid for overtime, being required to work off the clock or being compelled to work through meal breaks.1 Illegal employer retaliation against workers who complained was also widespread. Meanwhile, a 2011 U.S. Department of Labor study assessing minimum wage violations alone estimated that workers throughout New York State were losing $10-$20 million dollars every week exclusively to violations of the federal minimum wage.2 When workers are cheated out of wages, the city bears a greater burden as fewer taxes are collected, impoverished workers turn to public programs to support their families, and workers have less money to spend supporting neighborhood businesses and the local economy. A growing body of research also details how strained family budgets negatively impact the next generation of New Yorkers.3
These findings highlight the need for greater city-level enforcement efforts for wage and hour and other basic workplace protections, especially as the budget of the federal Department of Labor faces severe cuts and potentially a shift in priorities away from enforcing core workplace rights.4 Indeed, the much-needed increases in New York State’s minimum wage that are now being phased in will only be effective to the extent that the minimum is meaningfully enforced. The pervasiveness of violations also demonstrates the importance of the of Office of Labor Policy and Standards mandate to work in close partnership with workers and their organizations to raise awareness of pay regulations and gain an understanding of the industries, occupations, and circumstances where violations persist and how to combat them more effectively. Working with employers to understand and comply with the changing law is also essential. The greater rate of wage violations among immigrant workers makes translation and interpretation of public information about workers’ rights into the languages understood by New Yorkers especially important, as is the emphasis that workers’ fundamental rights apply regardless of immigration status.
Finally, the need to rely on research data collected in 2008 (National Employment Law Project) and 2011 (U.S. Department of Labor) to assess the pervasiveness of violations highlights the imperative for additional, up-to-date research to better understand compliance with wage and hour and other vital workplace laws and to assess the extent to which regulatory and enforcement efforts are effective and how they could be improved. Alongside enforcement, public outreach, and coordination efforts, rigorous, critical research into the conditions faced by workers will require significant resources but is vital to protecting New Yorkers’ right to fair compensation for their labor.
Public Awareness of Paid Leave
Throughout the nation, 6 in 10 low-paid workers have no access to paid sick time.5 Working New Yorkers do have this right – and multilingual public outreach efforts like the “Feel 100%, Work 100%” campaign on subways and buses have undoubtedly helped to increase awareness. These efforts must be ongoing, with resources devoted to continuous outreach to workers and their employers. As with violations of wage and hour laws, public outreach and education must be coupled with enforcement, partnership with worker organizations, research and a continued emphasis that the law applies regardless of immigration status. As OLPS’s mission appropriately includes conducting public education and outreach about not only city workplace laws but also state and federal protections that apply to New Yorkers, it will also be vital to work with New York State to educate expectant parents, family caregivers, and their employers in the city about rights and responsibilities under the state’s new paid family leave law, going into effect on January 1, 2018.
Investment in Child Care
Access to child care must be considered a core element of workers’ rights in New York City: first, because quality, affordable child care is essential for parents of young children to participate in the workforce and second because the Census estimates that more than 27,000 people are employed as child care workers in the New York City metropolitan area (a number which may dramatically undercount child care employment given the extent to which child care employment is often informal).6 The reality that child care is both unaffordable for parents and offers unlivable wages to child care workers indicates that private markets are not adequately meeting the need for care: child care is – and must be treated as – a public good to serve all New Yorkers.  
The guarantee of universal preschool to all four-year-olds in New York City is a giant step toward addressing the crisis of care facing working parents. Yet parents of younger children still face daunting obstacles to participation in the labor force, particularly among low-income households whose expenses for child care often exceed the cost of rent. In 2015, the Public Advocate’s Office concluded that the average annual cost of infant care in New York City was $16,250 and was increasing by almost $1,612 each year.7 While child care subsidies currently serve just 17 percent of eligible families statewide, the most recent New York State budget cuts an additional $7 million in child care subsidies to low-income families. Despite promises to help families with child care costs, Trump’s budget and tax plans may make matters worse for working New Yorkers.8 To participate in the labor force, New Yorkers need greater access to affordable, quality child care.
A focus on the city’s child care workforce is vital as caregivers, predominantly women of color and immigrants, are among New York’s most vulnerable employees, facing low wages and economic insecurity whether they are employed in home- or center-based care. Since 1997, child care workers nationwide have experienced no real increase in earnings despite a near doubling in the cost of child care services to parents.9 Domestic Workers United’s 2006 survey of child care and other workers employed in New York City’s private homes found even more troubling patterns of low pay, legal violations, lack of health coverage and abusive treatment by employers.10 OLPS’ focus on the child care workforce is important for educating workers and employers about their rights, enforcing the Domestic Workers’ Bill of Rights and other relevant laws, and undertaking research to better understand the scope of serious challenges that continue to face the workforce.11 This effort must be well-resourced to accomplish its aims.
Combating Discrimination
Eliminating discriminatory barriers to employment for qualified workers is essential so that all New Yorkers have an equal chance in our economy. In 2015, New York City enacted the Stop Credit Discrimination in Employment Act banning the use of consumer credit history for employment decisions and the Fair Chance Act barring employers from inquiring about or considering the criminal history of job applicants until after extending a conditional offer of employment. These laws further strengthen New York City’s robust anti-discrimination laws by ensuring that jobseekers with an arrest or conviction record and those with blemished personal credit histories have a fair opportunity to be judged and their qualifications and attain employment. The effectiveness of these and other laws prohibiting employment discrimination will rely on continued public education and outreach so that job seekers, employees, and employers are aware of their rights and responsibilities. The New York City Commission on Human Rights must also be proactive in detecting patterns of discrimination and taking action to prevent employment bias.
The protection offered by the Fair Chance Act and Stop Credit Discrimination in Employment Act is particularly important because both personal credit history and criminal record can become proxies for racial discrimination. People of color face disproportionate challenges in attaining and maintaining good credit due to the enduring impact of racial discrimination in employment, lending, education, and housing.12 Despite the prevalence of employment credit checks throughout the United States, there is a lack of evidence connecting personal credit history with job performance.13 Thus New York’s law banning credit checks at any stage of the employment process is critical. At the same time, a racially biased criminal justice system means people of color are disproportionately likely to have a record of arrest or conviction. Long after a sentence has been served, the stigma of a criminal record persists on employment background checks, decreasing a job-seekers’ chances of a job callback or offer of employment by almost 50 percent.14 Yet rates of criminal recidivism are significantly lower among former offenders who are able to obtain steady employment.15 Removing questions about conviction and arrest records from job applications and not inquiring about conviction history until the conditional offer stage of the hiring process ensure that job applicants have a fair chance to be judged on their qualifications.
In Conclusion
Thank you again for the opportunity to provide testimony. Improving conditions for working New Yorkers by upholding wage and hour laws, paid sick time and paid family leave, and protection from employment discrimination, while increasing public investment in child care and the well-being of the child care workforce is a formidable challenge and will demand significant resources for legal enforcement, public education and outreach, and research. Given appropriate resources, we are confident that New York City’s Office of Labor Policy and Standards, the Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs and the New York City Commission on Human Rights are up to the task.

 ",testimony-and-public-comment
"Dear Ms. Verma:
I am writing on behalf of Demos to urge you to withdraw the proposed rule issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and published in the Federal Register on July 12, 2018, which would repeal a current regulatory provision clarifying that states may make deductions from provider payments for costs such as health care and skills training without violating the Medicaid prohibition on reassignment of provider claims at 1902(a)(32) of the Social Security Act.
Demos is a public policy organization working for an America where we all have an equal say in our democracy and an equal chance in our economy. A core part of attaining an equal chance in our economy is guaranteeing the freedom of all working Americans to join a union. As an organization dedicated to racial and gender equity, we are particularly concerned that the proposed rule restricts that freedom and endangers job standards for the home care workforce, 90 percent of whom are women, and more than half of whom are women of color.  
We know that the ability for home care workers to choose to join a union and have dues deducted from pay not only puts this historically marginalized workforce on the same level as other private and public sector workers who have this ability, but has also led to improvements to workforce standards that have improved the lives of home care providers and strengthened Medicaid home and community-based services (HCBS) programs. The proposed rule would reverse that progress and represents an attack on home care workers. Apart from the substance of the proposal, we are also troubled by the process that led to this NPRM. We know of no state Medicaid program that has requested this change, nor do we understand why CMS is proposing an action that completely reverses previous policy and that the agency acknowledges could be economically significant with so little discussion of its rationale for the change and almost no analysis of its economic and other impact. Also troubling is the fact that CMS has taken the extraordinary step of limiting the public comment period to 30 days, allowing little time for the hundreds of thousands of workers who will be affected by it to provide input. We urge you to withdraw this rule, for the reasons described below.    
Role of Home Care Workers in Medicaid HCBS Programs
In recent decades, the proportion of total Medicaid spending on long-term services and supports (LTSS) devoted to HCBS has grown from a level of less than ten percent in the early 1980s to more than half (53 percent in 2014) of Medicaid LTSS spending,[1] in response to both changing consumer preferences and legal decisions. HCBS that are provided in a consumer’s home typically include assistance with activities such as bathing and toileting, meal preparation and feeding, as well as some health-related tasks, and accompanying a consumer to medical appointments. HCBS programs cannot function without home care workers—without a worker there is no access to care. While many home care workers provide care to a family member, and doing so is their full-time job, most do not—and the need for workers will become increasingly acute as the population of people needing care increases rapidly in future years.
There are two basic models for delivering home care services. Under the agency model, the state Medicaid HCBS program contracts with home care agencies that employ home care providers and the home care agency assigns workers to beneficiaries, directs their work, sets wages, and issues a paycheck to them. In contrast, self-directed models of HCBS, under which consumers retain greater power to hire and direct services, individual providers (IPs) of home care contract directly with the state and are typically paid via a fiscal intermediary that processes payments in the same way that private businesses may hire a payroll processing companies to compute tax, health care and other deductions and cut checks for employees—functions that would be extremely burdensome for the consumer to perform. From the perspective of CMS, the formal Medicaid payment to agencies is made in the form of a rate payment to the agency that incorporates costs of labor and administrative costs, a portion of which the agency then uses to pay the worker. In contrast, in the case of IP home care workers the analogous payment occurs at the individual provider level, when the state makes a payment to the provider—yet from the worker perspective there is little difference: in both cases a worker receives what amounts to an hourly payment for providing identical types of services.
The Role of Home Care Worker Organizations
A key challenge in ensuring access to care for elders and people with disabilities is the poor quality of home care jobs. It is no secret that there is a shortage of home care workers—the vast majority of states have already reported ""serious"" or ""very serious"" shortages in the home care workforce generally,[2] and the shortage of workers has affected Medicaid HCBS programs as well as the broader market for some time. A 2008 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report that examined the direct services workforce, including home and personal care workers, found that “a major factor in the deficit of direct care workers is the poor quality of these types of jobs,” noting that “much more needs to be done to enhance to the quality of these jobs” in order to create an effective workforce.[3] The IOM report identified a number of issues that contribute to this poor job quality, including low wages, lack of benefits, high levels of physical and emotional stress, and job-related injuries.
Unions have played an important role in helping address these issues by raising wages through the collective bargaining process and advocacy to increase Medicaid funding and payment rates, as well as providing opportunities for home care workers to share their experiences with each other and creating a mechanism to provide workers with a voice in decisions that affect them. One 2005 study that examined the effect of wage increases for 18,000 home care workers in San Francisco over the years 1996-2002, after workers won substantial wage increases through their union, found a significant decrease in turnover associated with the pay increase.[4]  Perhaps equally important has been the role of home care worker unions in providing a voice and identity for a workforce that has historically been marginalized. For both cultural reasons and thanks to the design of social U.S. social programs, home care work has been devalued and providers of care treated as second class citizens, unworthy of basic labor protections or decent wages—treatment reflected in the exclusion of home care workers from Fair Labor Standards Act protections until quite recently.[5] This is particularly true in the case of IP home care providers who may experience even greater isolation and be regarded as less “professional” than home care workers employed by agencies, who typically had somewhat better access to standard employment benefits, such as health benefits, in the years before independent providers formed unions.[6]
In states where home care workers have formed unions, providers employed by home care agencies are able to join a union and collectively bargain with the agency under the federal National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). The unique structure of the IP employment situation means that these workers do not have the same collective bargaining rights under the NLRA. Instead, a number of states have created structures—such as a state authority— to allow IPs to join together in a union, allowing these workers to bargain for wages and provide input into discussions of issues that affect them and the consumers they serve. In this case, the state is authorized to deduct a portion of an IP home care worker’s service payment for dues and any other benefits, in the same way that home care agencies make these deductions for workers they employ. Following the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2014 decision in Harris v. Quinn, states may deduct dues only for independent providers who are members of a union and may not make such deductions for workers who have not joined the union. The ability for IP home care workers to make dues deductions thus provides an important measure of parity with agency home care and other institutional direct care workers who provide similar or identical services, and state’s adoption of these structures is part of a larger set of policies to remedy the historically unjust treatment of this particular group of workers. In proposing to now apply a Medicaid payment rule that was never intended to apply to this group of workers (see discussion below), CMS seeks to exploit the unique employment and payment structure of IP home care providers to reverse the progress that has been made and to once again relegate these providers to second-place status. In so doing, it risks harming not only the workers, but also the consumers who depend on them.
The Anti-Reassignment Provision Does Not Apply To Home Care Provider Deductions    
An examination of the history of the statutory provisions clearly shows that when Congress adopted the anti-reassignment provision (1902(a)(3)) in 1972 it did so to address concerns about the practice of “factoring,” under which physicians and other providers assigned their payment claims to a third party, such as a collection agency, a practice that Congress recognized had led to “incorrect and inflated claims for services and…created administrative problems with respect to determinations of reasonable charges and recovery of overpayments.”[7] Neither the statute nor the relevant regulations say anything about dues deductions; moreover, courts have uniformly concluded that similar arrangements, where funds are automatically transferred to a third party (such as so-called “double lockbox” arrangements used to convey Medicaid provider payments to a third party pursuant to the provider’s standing instructions) are valid so long as they are consistent with the purposes of the statute. The practice of states making deductions for union dues and other costs, such as health care, on behalf of independent home care providers existed well before 2014, starting with voluntary dues deduction arrangements in some California counties in the mid-1990s. CMS leaders under several previous administrations were aware of and did not oppose the practice, yet the NPRM singles out dues deductions to unions as the sole example of a practice that will be implicated by the new rule. This amounts to a substantial policy shift for which CMS provides no policy rationale, and one that will have a major impact on states, providers and consumers who have built consumer directed programs in reliance on CMS’s position that payments like those described in 2014 regulation are allowable.
CMS’ Characterization of the Current Payment Structure is Incorrect and Misleading
CMS provides little rationale for the NPRM, beyond an apparently sudden and new “concern” that the provision is “overbroad and insufficiently linked to the exceptions expressly permitted by the statute.”[8]  We addressed the second of these concerns in the section above, but it is difficult to assess what policy problem, CMS seeks to address, given the lack of discussion in the NPRM. No stakeholder organization has identified the ability of workers to make deductions for dues and other benefits as a problem. The press release CMS issued to announce the NPRM is somewhat more explicit about CMS’ motive. It notes that the rule will end the ability of states to “divert Medicaid payments away from providers” and claims that the rule is “designed to ensure that taxpayer dollars dedicated to providing healthcare services for low-income vulnerable Americans are not siphoned away for other purposes.” These claims echo the contention of Senator Ron Johnson, in a letter he sent to CMS and in a follow-up staff report from the Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs, that states are “skimming” dues from Medicaid payments that would otherwise go to provide care for Medicaid recipients. The NPRM’s regulatory impact analysis reflects a similar misunderstanding, suggesting for instance that states may be increasing reimbursement levels in order to reassign portions of the provider payment to a third party and that they may lower those rates if providers are no longer able to deduct payments for dues or other benefits.[9]
This description of the flow of dollars under current payment arrangements is a gross mischaracterization that at best reflects a profound lack of understanding of IP home care payment structures and at worst is deliberately misleading. Deductions made by states on behalf of home care workers for dues and other costs, such as health benefits, do not “divert” or “siphon” Medicaid dollars from any state Medicaid program. Rather, individual provider home care workers receive payments from state Medicaid programs for services they provide to home care consumers. There is no “diversion” because the amount deducted for dues comes from the payment for services that has been made to the provider, who voluntarily chooses to direct it to a union or other entity. If the worker chooses not to authorize dues deduction, she keeps the full payment for the home care work she has already performed; it is not suddenly available for new spending—Medicaid expenditures and the amount spent on care remain the same.
CMS’s Analysis of the Regulatory Impact is Insufficient
Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to perform cost benefit analyses of proposed regulations and to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits, “including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and equity.”[10] The criteria for determining whether a rule can be considered economically significant takes into account not only the impact of the regulation on the economy as measured in dollar terms, but also broader effects[11] (“Costs and benefits shall be understood to include both quantifiable measures (to the fullest extent that these can be usefully estimated) and qualitative measures of costs and benefits that are difficult to quantify, but nevertheless essential to consider.) Yet not only is CMS unable to provide an analysis of the direct dollar impact of the regulation—acknowledging that it lacks sufficient data and relying on citations from a single newspaper article to support a speculative and preliminary estimate,[12] the NPRM also lacks any discussion of the broader impact of the rule. Given the important role of unions in raising standards for the home care workforce, it stands to reason that curtailing the ability of workers to participate in unions through application of the reassignment prohibition will have an adverse impact on them. A full analysis of economic impact would also consider the effect on GDP of workers leaving paid work to care for family members because no provider is available due to increased worker shortages. We urge you to conduct and publish an analysis of these issues before moving ahead to finalize this rule and believe that a fair and full assessment will lead you to withdraw the rule.
For these reasons, Demos urges CMS to withdraw the proposed rule on the reassignment of Medicaid provider claims.

"Two major stories of corporate misconduct toward employees hit the headlines yesterday: in the morning, low-wage federal contract workers filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Labor alleging that more than 100 employees in the food court of federally-owned Union Station had been victims of wage theft—paid less than the minimum wage or denied overtime pay. In the afternoon, the National Labor Relations Board issued a complaint against Walmart for illegally threatening and retaliating against employees who exercised their legal rights to strike and protest.
I’ve had the opportunity to do research about both Walmart’s employment standards and the federal government’s policies toward its contract workforce, (I also shared this research at the press conference announcing the Union Station complaint). The gist of both studies is that pay rates could use a lot of improvement, and the country as a whole would benefit if low-paid workers—whether they’re federal contract employees, Walmart workers, or anyone else stuck in a low-wage job—earned enough to buy the basics and support their families.
But raising wages above the minimum isn’t even at issue in the recent complaints: following the law is.
According to the Union Station complaint, the fast food companies with outlets in the landmark train station’s basement food court—located in the heart of Washington DC, within sight of the Capitol Building—thought they could get away with paying employees at little as $5.56 an hour, in blatant violation of both city and federal minimum wage laws. Good Jobs Nation, the organization representing Union Station workers, asserts that according to their calculations:
the employees of the businesses included in this Compliant have lost, on average, almost $10,000 per year, per person—or 28 percent of the pay to which they are legally entitled—as a result of wage theft and that, together, Union Station food court employees are entitled to recover over three-million dollars in backpay and damages for the three years recoverable under the FLSA in case of willful violations. 
Meanwhile, the National Labor Relations Board issued the largest-ever complaint against Walmart this week for breaking federal labor law by violating workers’ rights. The complaint alleges Walmart illegally fired and disciplined nearly 70 workers, including those who went on strike last June to speak out for better jobs.
What the two cases have in common is the sense among corporations that they can break workplace laws—whether it’s wage and hour laws or employees’ right to organize—with impunity. The generally weak penalties for violating labor and employment laws represent the biggest obstacle to strong enforcement. Yet as the Department of Labor and National Labor Relations Board investigate and prosecute these cases, they must send the strongest possible message that violations of workplace rights are not acceptable.",blog
"Signed into law on May 22, 2009, the Credit CARD Act has benefited millions of households in ways that directly affect their monthly budgets. Demos’ 2012 National Survey on Credit Card Debt of Low- and Middle- Income Households finds that the Credit CARD Act empowers Americans to take control of their finances by increasing the transparency of credit card statements and dramatically reducing unfair and excessive fees and penalties
The Credit CARD Act set new regulations for clarity and disclosure in monthly billing statements. For example, credit card statements must now include information on how long it will take to pay off the current balance if consumers pay only the minimum payment amount each month.
The Credit CARD Act requires credit card companies to provide 21 days between the time they mail a bill and when they charge a late fee. It also puts reasonable limits on late fees and interest rate penalties.

One of the most abusive credit card practices before the Credit CARD Act was imposing over-the-limit fees. Instead of denying transactions that exceeded a consumer’s credit limit, credit card companies used to process them and then charge consumers a fee—whether the consumers wanted to go above their credit limit or not. The Credit CARD Act requires consumer authorization for exceeding limits.
Smart regulation has made credit cards a better, fairer financial product for American consumers.",policy-briefs
"You usually get what you pay for. That’s why the Village Voice’s recent headline “Air Safety on the Cheap,” was so alarming. The article documented the working life of Prince Jackson, a security guard employed by a contracting company at Kennedy International Airport. Charged with responding to alarms and ensuring that unauthorized people do not enter restricted areas of the airport or get into the terminals without a security screening, The Voice made the case that “Jackson is an integral part of aviation security at JFK.” But it also added: “He makes $8 an hour, doesn't get sick days, and doesn't have health insurance.” The upshot? Shoe removal and fancy body scanners aside, treating security employees with such indifference may say more about the real priority placed on airport safety.
Unfortunately, Jackson’s story is typical of the 14,634 passenger service workers working for airline contractors in the the three major airports serving the New York metro area, according to a new report from New York University’s Women of Color Policy Network. Workers in passenger service jobs -- including security officers and screeners, baggage handlers, skycaps, ramp agents and janitors – earn a median of $8.00 an hour and lack benefits.
It’s clearly a bad deal for workers, and should be enough to make anyone nervous about security, but adding insult to injury is the fact that taxpayers are also getting the short end of the stick. The NYU report points out that the federal government provided $15 billion in grants and loans to the airlines after 9/11 and continues to bestow public subsidies such as tax-free bonds and fuel breaks on the industry. And despite all this public largesse, the airline industry chooses to do business with such low-wage contractors that their workforce policies necessitate a second set of public subsidies: nearly one in four passenger service workers at airline contractors rely on government sponsored health coverage, and one in five depend on food stamps to feed their families. Other subsidies, from the earned income tax credit to rental and heating assistance were not quantified in the report, but are likely substantial.
Much of the wealth of the New York metropolitan region flows through its airports, yet many of the employees critical to keeping the airports functioning live in poverty. The airlines could continue to shrug their shoulders and insist that it is their contractors – not the airlines themselves – that are responsible for the state of affairs. Or New Yorkers could hold the Port Authority, the public entity that is ultimately responsible for the airports, accountable for the contracting practices implemented in its purview. This is a strategy that’s worked before.
In 2000, the San Francisco Airport Commission adopted a program to increase the quality of airport services by establishing a new minimum wage for airport workers and guaranteeing basic benefits and paid time off, among other policies. While the costs of the program amounted to just $1.42 per passenger, low-wage workers saw their incomes shoot up 33 percent and employment at the airport increased. Employers reported increased employee performance. Employee turnover rates declined dramatically, plunging 80 percent for security screeners, a particularly important fact for safety since lower turnover is associated with greater likelihood of detecting security breaches.
A similar program implemented by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey would cost airlines less than one percent of their annual revenue, according to the NYU study. Surely that’s not too much to pay for a boost in both air safety and economic justice.",blog
"Alongside the everyday low prices, Walmart shoppers in Landover Hills, Maryland, might encounter Gail Todd. A mother of three who works there as a sales associate, Gail would like to work full time but has recently seen her schedule cut to as few as 12 hours a week. She has no idea how much she’ll end up making this year; even when she was working closer to full time, she expected to bring home just $17,000. Currently she and her family depend on D.C.’s public health care system, food stamps and low-income housing to stay afloat.
Gail’s dilemma is the norm among retail workers. Retail salesperson is the most common job in the country, and the industry’s low pay and erratic scheduling leaves employees — especially the 7.2 million women who disproportionately fill these low-wage jobs — in poverty. The national discussion on the gender pay gap has focused on high-level executives such as Jill Abramson, but inequality in pay is not limited to America’s C-suites. In fact, the retail industry has a big gender pay gap. The typical retail salesman brings home $14.62 an hour, while the typical retail saleswoman earns just $10.58 an hour. Overall in sales and related occupations, the pay gap is costingwomen $40.8 billion in wages a year.",media
"If you want to make crime pay—and get a lighter penalty if you’re caught—you’re better off cheating your employees out of their fair wages than trying to nick the latest video game console or pair of designer shoes off the shelves of your local retailer. That’s the conclusion of my new Demos research brief, The Steal. And no, it’s not a how-to for aspiring criminals.
Instead, it’s a look at one way the American justice system is skewed in favor of power and privilege, treating the crimes of the powerful, such as stealing from employees’ paychecks, far more leniently than crimes committed by those with less power, such as shoplifting.
Drawing on data from a rigorous new study of minimum wage violations by David Cooper and Teresa Kroeger at the Economic Policy Institute, we compare the dollar value of shoplifting with the value of minimum wage violations, and find that they are roughly comparable. Each year between 2013 and 2015, retailers lost approximately $14.7 billion to shoplifting, while employers stole an estimated $15 billion through one form of wage theft alone: paying less than the legal minimum wage. 
Minimum wage violations and shoplifting are crimes of similar scale, yet that’s where the similarities end. Despite the way that wage theft devastates working Americans and their families, pushes hundreds of thousands of people into poverty, robs states and cities of tax revenue, and places law-abiding businesses at a competitive disadvantage, we find that dramatically more resources go into detecting and deterring shoplifting than into preventing wage theft.
When wage thieves are caught, they also face a starkly different experience from shoplifters. If a shoplifter steals more than $2,500 in merchandise, he or she can face felony charges in any state in the country. Many states impose felony charges for stealing much less valuable merchandise. Yet criminal penalties of any kind are very rare when it comes to wage theft. Even when millions of dollars are stolen from employee paychecks, only mild civil penalties are applied under federal law.
The result is no surprise: unprincipled employers realize that the reward of stealing wages is greater than the risk of a slap on the wrist if they get caught. Not only are many large corporations serial violators of wage laws, many even continue to be awarded lucrative federal contracts after being penalized.
The disparity between the crimes of the powerful and those with less power is deeply linked to who the victims and perceived perpetrators are. Women, people of color, and immigrants, especially undocumented workers, are disproportionately likely to be victims of wage theft; a violation that disproportionately impacts them is allotted fewer resources for deterrence, investigation, and enforcement compared to shoplifting, and penalties are weaker. In contrast, even though shoplifting is committed by people of all ethnic and racial backgrounds, people of color, particularly African American consumers, are profiled as potential shoplifters, feeding into racial and ethnic disparities throughout the criminal justice system.
Efforts to create a more just system must focus on both sides of the equation. The nation must eliminate retail profiling and racial bias in the criminal justice system, but also place a far greater focus on deterring and penalizing the crimes of the powerful, including wage theft.",blog
"“If a company is going to receive taxpayer money, it should have safe workplaces. It should pay its workers the wages they’ve earned. It should provide the medical leave workers are entitled to. It should not discriminate against workers… If you want to do business with the United States of America, you’ve got to respect our workers, you’ve got to respect our taxpayers.”
The statement from President Obama seemed about as uncontroversial as they come. The content of his executive order, designed to urge companies with federal contracts to come into compliance with the most basic worker protection laws, was similarly judicious and reasonable. But to the corporate lobbyists from the Associated Builders and Contractors and the International Franchise Association, talk of following workplace safety regulations and anti-discrimination laws sounded like fighting words.
The trade groups, among the most prominent representing federal contractors and concessionaires, immediately denounced favoritism, abuse, and “politically motivated executive overreach” that would result in “blacklisting businesses from federal contracts.” The lobbyists vowed to fight the order through Congress, the courts, and the rulemaking process.
A New York Times editorial this week was incredulous. Were contracting lobbyists really calling for “the right to cheat and maim” their employees? After all, the problems addressed by the executive order are very real: while most contractors surely abide by the law, nearly 30 percent of companies receiving the highest penalties for violations of federal labor law are among the ranks of federal contractors, according to a study by the U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. Forty-nine federal contractors liable for major violations of labor law were responsible for close to 1,800 distinct enforcement actions by the Department of Labor over six years and were obligated to pay $196 million in penalties and back wages. 
As my colleague Jenn Rolnick Borchetta has repeatedly argued in the context of President Obama’s minimum wage increase for contract workers, claims of executive overreach on contracting ring hollow. The President is on solid legal ground As the New York Times points out:
Under existing law, federal officials can bar contracts to companies with serious labor law violations. Mr. Obama’s order helps to execute the law by requiring bidders for federal contracts to disclose their labor-law violations going back three years and by putting an official at each federal agency in charge of tracking the disclosures.
The administration has been careful not to burden contractors and certainly does not seek to penalize companies for isolated, inadvertent and easily correctable mistakes. If a company has not had any violations, it simply checks a box attesting to that fact. If a company reports violations, procurement officials are to look for evidence of pervasive, repeated, willful or serious wrongdoing in weighing whether to deny a contract.
In addition, the order does not take effect until 2016 — giving companies time to start cleaning up their labor records if necessary.
But while the executive order a sensible move to bring companies whose business depends on taxpayer dollars into compliance with basic workplace protections, it’s not a complete one. New York Times editorial board member Teresa Tritch recently made the case that to truly ensure that “federal contracting is not a contest to see who can pay the least, but a rational process both for ensuring good jobs at fair pay and for setting an example for the private sector”
President Obama should go further, signing a Good Jobs executive order that would encourage contractors to improve workplace benefits and respect their employees’ rights to bargain collectively. This would reach beyond compliance with existing law and the President’s minimum wage increase to put more than 20 million Americans on the pathway to the middle class, as my colleagues explained in a recent study. Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton was thinking along the same lines when she introduced legislation directing the Secretary of Labor to promulgate regulations implementing Good Jobs Model Employer Standards.
The Department of Labor shouldn’t let handwringing by lobbyists stop them from drafting effective regulations to ensure that contractors follow existing laws.
Nor should the President let his detractors slow him down. President Obama’s executive orders—raising the minimum wage for federal contract workers; barring contractors from employment discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity; ensuring that contract employees who discuss their compensation are not retaliated against; and now encouraging compliance with worker protections—will improve the lives of millions of federal contract workers and paint a vivid picture of the nation we could be if Congress acted to ensure that all employers are held to the same standard.
A “Good Jobs Executive Order” is the next logical step.",blog
"It’s not every day that low-paid workers — cleaners mopping the floors of Washington’s Union Station, vendors selling pretzels at the National Zoo, servers dishing out hot lunch at congressional cafeterias — speak out and win a voice in setting national policy. Yet three years ago, that’s exactly what began to happen.
In May 2013, workers employed by private companies under contract with the federal government came together to form Good Jobs Nation – and walked out on strike in the nation’s capital.
Hundreds of workers flooded the streets of D.C. that day and for 17 more strikes in the years since. They stood up on behalf of nearly 2 million more workers who — as my Demos colleague Robert Hiltonsmith and I found in our research — were paid $12 an hour or less to work on behalf of the American people, employed by private companies through contracts, grants, loans, concession agreements and property leases with the federal government. At the same time, many of these same companies provided their executives with exorbitant compensation on the taxpayer dime. Even as President Obama and a growing number of economic analysts were identifying the loss of stable, middle-class jobs as a top national concern, U.S. tax dollars were effectively fueling the low-wage economy and exacerbating inequality.",media
"Education has long been recognized as a primary means of improving one’s economic prospects. Today, a postsecondary degree or certificate has become increasingly necessary for earning a middle-class living. The last two decades have greatly heightened the demand for a highly educated workforce—and the earnings differential between those with and without college degrees has widened substantially. A worker with a bachelor’s degree now earns about 66 percent more than a worker with only a high school diploma.1 Over a lifetime, that wage gap will add up to over $1,000,000. At the same time, a college education has become more difficult for students from modest backgrounds to afford.
The rising cost of higher education is a problem in and of itself – and colleges and universities must act to keep their tuition in check. But students are also hindered by the way student aid is allocated. Over the last 20 years, federal financial aid has steadily shifted away from grant-based aid to a predominantly loan-based system. As a result, borrowing has become the most common way for students to finance their education. In 2009, the average graduating college senior from a four-year institution was saddled with $24,000 in debt, a number that has been rising steadily.2 This works out to a monthly payment of $276, or 9.5 percent of the typical graduate’s income. Yet repaying student loans will be even more difficult for many graduates given that the unemployment rate for young degree-holders soared to 8.7 percent in 2009.3 The picture is still darker for students who left school without completing a degree – of the students who entered college in 2003 (the most recent year for which data is available), 31 percent of those with student loan debt in excess of $22,000 had not earned a degree six years later.4 The student loan burden is taking a toll on young adults’ lives: almost 1 in 5 significantly changed their career plans because of student loans; nearly 40 percent delayed buying a home and just over 20 percent reported their debt burden caused them to delay having children.5
The major reason for lower enrollments in 4-year institutions among qualified students from low-income families is the level of unmet need they face in attending college. Unmet need is the amount needed to cover expenses after all loans, grants and work study wages are accounted for. On average, the annual unmet need of low-income families has reached historic levels. In academic year 2007-08, the average low-income family faced $6,480 in unmet need for a public 2-year institution; $9,030 for a public 4-year institution; and $10,400 for a private non-profit 4-year institution.6 Unmet need has forced low- and moderate-income students to abandon the most successful recipe for obtaining a college degree: full-time, on-campus study.
As a result of unmet need, the highest achieving students from poor backgrounds attend college at the same rate as the lowest achieving students from wealthy backgrounds. Or to put it more coarsely: the least bright wealthy kids attend college at the same rate as the smartest poor kids.
A four-year college degree is not the only way to achieve a middle class standard of living: associates degrees and one- and two-year credentials, especially in high-demand fields like engineering and health care, can also represent a path to economic prosperity, in some cases opening the door to earnings that outpace the salaries of some bachelors degree holders.7 The Contract for College would not only provide grant and loan assistance to community college students, but would strengthen the nation’s network of open-enrollment community colleges by reviving President Obama’s plan for the American Graduation Initiative, investing $12 billion in community colleges over the next decade with the aim of producing 5 million additional community college graduates.
Finally, the Contract for College expands college access for one particularly disadvantaged group of students: young people who have grown up in the United States and flourished academically at American high schools but do not have legal immigration status because of immigration decisions made by their parents, often when they were small children. An estimated 65,000 unauthorized immigrant students graduate from high school every year.8 They are excluded from most scholarships, are barred from receiving federal financial aid, and cannot work legally to pay for college. Even a college degree will not guarantee them the opportunity to enter the legal workforce. Instead of making these young people a part of our future middle class, the nation squanders the talent and ability of unauthorized immigrant students by forcing them to remain in the shadows. The Contract for College includes provisions similar to the proposed federal DREAM Act which would offer a path to citizenship to unauthorized students who complete high school and agree to attend college.
The Contract for College would unify existing strands of federal financial aid – grants, loans and work-study – into a coherent, guaranteed financial aid package for students.9 Grants would make up the bulk of aid for students from low- and moderate-income families. The Contract will recognize the important value of reciprocity – so part of the Contract for every student will include some amount of student loan aid and/or work-study requirement. The Contract is designed to reorient federal aid back to a more grant-based system and ensure that students from all financial backgrounds have upfront knowledge and understanding of the amount and type of financial aid that will be available during their entire course of study. The Contract also provides direct federal investment in community colleges to fund the President’s American Graduation Initiative and offers temporary legal immigration status and path to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants who came to the U.S. as children and plan to attend college.
The key design elements to the Contract for College are featured below, including how existing federal policy and programs will be refashioned under the Contract system.
The grants provided under the Contract would modernize the current Pell Grant system and would operate in much the same manner, with two exceptions. The first is that the Contract for College should be funded as an entitlement. One of the major deficiencies of the Pell Grant program is that it has been consistently underfunded, resulting in lower grant amounts than the maximum allowed by the law. The second is that the grants will be more flexible than the current Pell Grant system. The amount of the grant will be based on the cost of attendance at the public institution in which the student chooses to enroll, with students at private institutions receiving grants equivalent to the average costs at a 4-year public university.
The amount a student can borrow through the federal student loan program will be determined by the cost of attendance minus the grant and work-study aid available to the student. Of course, with the enhanced level of grant aid, many families will no longer need their children to take out loans to help pay for college. For students from families whose income is high enough to make them ineligible for grant or work-study aid, the annual maximum loan amount will be $10,000 in unsubsidized loans.
Students will be awarded aid for enrollment in any two- or four-year public institution. The amount of the total aid package will be based on the tuition, fees, room and board and book costs provided by the college in which the student plans to enroll. Students who choose to live off-campus will receive the equivalent to those choosing to live on-campus. Students wishing to enroll in private institutions will be provided a financial aid package equivalent to the average costs at a 4-year public university. Dependent and independent students will be treated the same under the Contract.
To encourage private and nonprofit entities to help low-income Americans with the full costs of higher education, the new system will match gifts or grants by private or nonprofit entities up to $2,000 annually. For example, if a private college offers a scholarship of $1,500 a year, the government will match the college’s investment. Or, if a business sets up a fund to help local high school graduates attend college, the recipients of such gifts would also receive a match for gifts up to $2,000. To further advance the goal of catalyzing new investments in higher education by businesses and philanthropies, we also propose creating the Contract for College Fund, a national trust that would actively seek out and match such investments.
An important component in designing this program is to ensure that families have early knowledge of the financial resources available to their children to attend college. At the start of the program, all households with students in the 8th grade and above will receive their Contract for College that estimates their aid package using the average cost of attendance at public 4-year institutions. Alerting students and parents about the amount of student aid available will help increase the expectation that attending and completing college is a realistic goal.
Invest $12 billion in community colleges over ten years to create a challenge fund for colleges to modernize their facilities; innovate and expand education and administrative reforms, including efforts to increase community college graduation rates; and assess colleges’ effectiveness, with the goal of producing 5 million new community college graduates by 2020.
In order to remove barriers to opportunity for young people who grew up in the U.S., unauthorized immigrant students who came to the U.S. at age 15 or younger and have lived in the country for at least five years will become qualified for conditional permanent resident status if they are accepted to college, graduate from a U.S. high school, or are awarded a GED in the U.S. Qualified students would be fully eligible for other higher education benefits under the Contract for Education. Students would not qualify for this relief if they have committed crimes or are judged a security risk. If these students then attend college or serve in the U.S. military, they will become eligible for permanent legal status and ultimately citizenship. These provisions mirror one version of the federal DREAM Act.
While each student’s final Contract will be based on the institution costs where the student chooses to enroll, we can use the average cost of attendance for 4-year colleges to model the type of aid students at different income levels will receive under the Contract. According to the College Board, the average total cost of attendance for one year at a public 4-year university was $16,140 for the 2010-2011 school year.10 This cost includes tuition, room and board, books and transportation.
The model below is for illustrative purposes. An actual plan would include more gradual phase-outs between each successive income level. It would also incorporate the likely grants by employers or NGOs and government matches, which are difficult to anticipate at this point.

"Investing in a skilled workforce is vital to America’s long-term economic growth and global competitiveness. Even as the Zero-16 Contract for Education proposed earlier would enable young people graduating from high school to pursue college or career training, the Career Opportunity Plan would increase opportunities for those who have already begun their working lives, particularly low-wage workers and the unemployed, to qualify for jobs that can support a middle-class standard of living. While worker retraining will not, by itself, solve America’s unemployment problem or transform the nation’s low-wage workforce, access to training is nevertheless critical for expanding economic mobility. Access to job training is particularly important for the growing number of long-term unemployed (5.4 million Americans have been out of work for 27 weeks or longer as of February 2012)1 as their skills become increasingly disused or outdated. 
In the coming decades, a large proportion of new jobs are projected in fields like health care that require education and training beyond high school, but not necessarily a four-year college degree.2 Enabling adults to retrain for these largely middle-class jobs provides an important mechanism for individuals to improve their economic prospects.
Investment in workforce development has traditionally been strongly bipartisan. With support from both major political parties, the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 streamlined the array of federal job training programs to create a decentralized network of “one-stop career centers” where jobseekers could access local employment and training opportunities and support programs under one roof.
In response to the mass unemployment and worker displacement of the Great Recession, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act provided a $4 billion boost in funding for job training programs in 2009, including grants earmarked to support training in the most rapidly growing sectors of the economy. These extra resources enabled a substantial increase in the number of citizens participating in occupational training and other workforce development programs – more than 8 million Americans accessed such services under the Workforce Investment Act in the 2009 program year.3 But the temporary increase failed to reverse the long-term shortfall in federal job training resources: funding for the Workforce Investment Act has fallen almost 30 percent over the past decade in real dollars, while funding for other adult education and workforce preparedness programs has also declined.4
In addition to greater investment in workforce development, it is also critical that job training programs correspond to the workforce needs of local and regional employers so that jobseekers are trained for positions that actually exist in their area. Our proposal is modeled on the Strengthening Employment Clusters to Organize Regional Success (SECTORS) Act, passed unanimously by the House of Representatives in 2010 but never taken up by the Senate. The legislation would provide grants under the Workforce Investment Act to promote partnerships between employers and postsecondary educational institutions in order to tailor job training programs to labor demand in a region’s growing industries.
Just as the Zero-16 Contract for Education encourages states to create an integrated educational system with clearly marked pathways for each educational stage, the nation’s workforce development system should also align programs and institutions to streamline career pathways for working adults. Finally, the Workforce Investment Act should shift its focus from short-term training and swift reemployment to also allow for longer-term training and certificate programs that will enable workers to qualify for middle class jobs.
This policy is based on recommendations developed by National Skills Coalition.

"In the aftermath of the Great Recession, Americans battered by job loss, foreclosure, and plummeting home values tightened their belts and paid down debt. The Latino community, hit particularly hard by the housing crash, was no exception. Yet new research from Demos’ National Survey on Credit Card Debt of Low- and Middle-Income Households finds that even as Latinos are carrying less credit card debt, four in ten Latino households with credit card debt are relying on their cards to pay for basic living expenses. This study explores the use of credit cards and the impact of debt on Latino households in the wake of the Great Recession.
Among low- and middle-income households with credit card debt:
Introduction
Years after recovery from the Great Recession officially began,1 millions of Americans still confront unemployment, reduced incomes, and a massive loss of household wealth. Latino communities, which were targeted for high-risk mortgage loans and had much of their wealth invested in their homes, were hit particularly hard by the bursting of the housing bubble.2 According to data analyzed by the Pew Research Center, Latino families lost a staggering 67 percent of their total wealth during the housing crisis, compared to a loss of just 12 percent for white families.3 This tremendous loss of wealth only compounds the extreme wealth gap for Latino households that existed before the Great Recession.
In a difficult economy, many families struggle to sustain a decent standard of living. When the roof leaks or a child needs emergency medical care, households living on a tight budget may dig into their savings or draw on other assets to make ends meet. Yet Latino households often have fewer assets to fall back on than many other Americans, with Latinos reporting a median net worth of just $7,843 in 2011 compared to $91,405 for white households.4 With fewer resources to turn to, it stands to reason that low- and middle-income Latino households with access to credit cards have borrowed to make ends meet: our study finds that four out of ten low- and middle-income Latino households with credit card debt report using their credit cards to pay for basic living expenses because they did not have enough money in their checking or savings accounts. For many Latino families, as with other low- and middle-income American households, credit cards became a “plastic safety net”—used to make up for stagnant income, lack of private assets, and the failure of public safety net programs such as unemployment insurance, food stamps, and Medicaid to adequately cover the needs of the nation’s population.
At the same time, access to credit on fair terms has itself been a historic challenge for the Latino community. For example, the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances found that in 2004 three-quarters of American households overall used credit cards.5 Yet among Hispanic households, just over half (54%) reported using credit cards that year. One reason for the reduced access to credit may be a lack of pre-existing credit history that would allow households to qualify for cards. Recent Latino immigrants, for example, may be “thin file” consumers, lacking prior credit history and may thus be regarded as risky borrowers who are given access to only high-interest, subprime credit products. These products, in turn, may carry such high interest that it becomes difficult or impossible for households to keep up with the payments—resulting in worse credit and the loss of household wealth observed in the housing crash. With such limited options before them, it is understandable why many Latino households express reluctance to take on debt and concern about the use of credit cards.6
Yet the credit landscape for American households as a whole has also changed as a result of the Great Recession and the financial crisis. In the 2010 and 2013 Survey of Consumer Finances, the proportion of households using credit cards was down to 68 percent, a drop of approximately 9 percent from the years before the crash.7 The proportion of Latino households using credit cards experienced a similar decline, dipping below 50 percent. The drop represents both a tightening of credit access by financial institutions and a tendency of American households to discharge and pay back debt. For Latino households seeking to build a credit profile and access better financial opportunities, reduced access to credit is a negative trend. At the same time, the fact that Latino households with credit card debt, like their non-Latino counterparts, report lower credit card balances is a positive sign that cardholders are paying down debt and incurring lower interest charges as a result. The 2008 Credit CARD Act, which provided new protections for consumers and particularly benefitted Latino cardholders, offers another bright spot in the credit card landscape.
This report draws on Demos’ 2012 National Survey of Credit Card Debt Among Low- and Middle-Income Households to explore credit card trends in the Latino community in greater depth. The nationally representative 2012 survey follows two previous Demos surveys, conducted in 2005 and 2008. Details about the methodology of the survey, and the Latino sample, are in the following sections of this report.
Methodology
In February and March of 2012, Demos and GfK Knowledge Networks conducted a nationally-representative survey of 1,997 households, including 997 households who had carried credit card debt for more than three months and 1,000 households who had credit cards but no credit card debt at the time of the survey. The survey was offered in Spanish as well as English to all households. For our survey, moderate-income is defined as a total household income between 50 percent and 120 percent of the local (county-level) median income. All of our respondents were at least 18 years of age. In order to ensure that the indebted sample captures households who carry credit card debt, as opposed to those carrying a temporary balance, we only included households who reported having a balance for more than three months. The margin of error for the total indebted sample is +/- 3.9 percentage points.
An additional sample was used to obtain reliable base sizes for African American and Latino populations. The margin of error for the oversample of 152 African American households is +/- 11.3 percentage points. The margin of error for the oversample of 205 Latino households is +/-9.1 percentage points.
Demographics of the Latino population surveyed
Our survey aimed to have a representative sample of Latino households with credit card debt. This population differs slightly from the overall Latino population nationwide.8 In general, Latinos in our sample of households with credit card debt tend to be significantly older, with higher rates of marriage, parenthood, and homeownership and slightly higher incomes than the Latino population as a whole. One explanation for these divergences may be the time it takes to build up a credit history sufficient to be approved for a credit card and accumulate debt. As a result, it is logical that Latinos who have accumulated credit card debt tend to be older and better established than their counterparts with no credit card debt.
Credit card basics for Latinos: balance, APR, and getting by on debt
In the aftermath of the Great Recession, Americans battered by job loss, foreclosure, and plummeting home values tightened their belts and paid down debt. According to data from the Federal Reserve, average credit card balances fell significantly in the three years following the financial collapse. But the trend toward household deleveraging is only part of the story: even as consumers paid down their balances, this study finds that many moderate income households continue to rely on credit cards to make ends meet. 

The broad trend among Latino credit card holders reflects that of American consumers as a whole. Among low- and middle-income Americans who carried credit card debt, our study finds that total average credit card debt fell 28 percent—from $9,887 in our 2008 survey to $7,145 in 2012. Among Latino households, the average credit card debt was lower but the decline was comparable: credit card debt fell 30 percent from $8,661 in 2008 to $6,066 in 2012. The number of credit cards that indebted households possessed also declined: in 2008, Latinos with credit card debt reported having 4.14 cards on average. In 2012, the average number of credit cards fell to 3.73.

While it’s a positive sign that households are paying down debt overall, patterns of credit card usage still raise serious concerns. More than 4 in 10 Latino households with credit card debt report that they relied on credit cards to pay for basic living expenses when paychecks and savings were not enough to make ends meet. Forty-three percent of indebted Latino households report using their credit cards for basic living expenses like rent, mortgage payments, groceries, utilities, or insurance because they did not have enough money in their checking or savings accounts, a rate that is similar to the survey population as a whole. And while some indebted Latino households also used credit cards for entertainment, vacations, and other “extras,” these were not the main drivers of credit card debt. When asked about the single expense that contributed most to credit card debt, only a third of Latinos cited non-essential costs, big or small. Instead, as we will explore more deeply in this paper, medical expenses and costs associated with unemployment were major contributors to debt for low- and middle-income Latino households.
 Whatever the source of credit card debt, it comes at a steep cost as interest charges accumulate. On average, Latinos report annual percentage rates (APRs) of 17.93 percent on the card where they carry the highest balance, a significantly higher rate than the 16.13 percent average for indebted households overall. The high interest rate paid by the average Latino borrower means that they will ultimately pay more in interest over the duration of their debt even though they carry lower average balances. For example, a Latino family carrying the average credit card debt load of $6,066 and average APR, making the average monthly payment, would be charged at least $300 more in interest than the average white family, even though they borrowed less. To make matters worse, 29 percent of Latino borrowers report extremely high APRs, with interest rates topping 20 percent or more. 
Imperfect credit may be one reason for the higher average interest rates paid by Latino credit cardholders. Many experts suggest a credit score of 700 or higher is needed to qualify for loans (including credit cards) with a lower rate of interest. Among indebted households that report knowing their credit score, just 40 percent of Latinos report a credit score above 700 compared to 59 percent of white households. At the same time, 68 percent of indebted Latinos report that they do not know their credit score, compared to 59 percent of the indebted population as a whole. Yet becoming more familiar with the credit scoring system may only go so far in helping Latino cardholders to improve their credit standing. Indeed, as the following sections will demonstrate, factors like unemployment and lack of health insurance are among the main drivers of credit card debt for Latinos. These larger social forces, which disproportionately impact the Latino community, cannot be addressed simply by increasing awareness of credit scores or how credit operates. 

Medical costs and credit card debt
The growing cost of health care strains the budgets of many American households, as families struggle to keep up with rising premiums, deductibles, and co-payments, or to find affordable care if they are uninsured.9 Medical expenses are frequently unplanned and unavoidable, forcing households that lack substantial savings to take on debt to meet the costs. Dealing with health costs is a particularly serious challenge for Latinos because they are less likely to have health insurance coverage, increasing the odds that health costs become a significant source of debt.
The U.S. Census Bureau finds that 29 percent of Latinos were uninsured in 2012—a rate nearly twice that of the population as a whole.10 In our sample of low- and middle-income Latino households carrying credit card debt, 43 percent report that in the past year they or someone in their household has been without medical insurance and 38 percent report that they or someone in their household is currently without health insurance—both significantly higher rates than the population as a whole. Yet there is reason for hope: as the federal Affordable Care Act goes into effect, insurance coverage by both Medicaid and private plans is expected to increase. The Department of Health and Human Services estimates that as many as 10.2 million uninsured Latinos have new opportunities for affordable health insurance coverage as a result of the Affordable Care Act.11 By 2013, the proportion of Latinos without health coverage had already fallen six percentage points, according to the Census Bureau, likely as a result of the early effects of the law.12
Despite these potential improvements on the horizon, medical debt will likely continue to burden the Latino community into the foreseeable future. A number of barriers—including immigration status, difficulty documenting income, the low proportion of Latinos who receive health coverage from their employers, and the reluctance of several states to expand Medicaid coverage—still stand in the way of full insurance coverage for the Latino population. And even when households do secure coverage, costs such as insurance deductibles, co-payments, and prescriptions may still be difficult to afford. At the same time, medical debts that accrued before families had coverage will continue to accumulate interest until they are paid off in full. 

The reality is that everyone eventually has health care needs and incurs out-of-pocket expenses. Three-quarters of low- and middle-income Latinos carrying credit card debt report that their household incurred some out-of-pocket medical expense in the last three years, a rate comparable to the rest of the indebted population. However, Latino households were significantly more likely than others to amass additional credit card debt as a result of these medical costs. For example, 73 percent of indebted Latinos who experienced hospital stays report that the associated expenses contributed to their credit card debt, compared to 56 percent in the indebted population who experienced hospital stays as a whole.13 At the same time, 53 percent of indebted Latinos who incurred out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs reported that these expenses contributed to their credit card debt, compared to just 46 percent of the indebted population as a whole who paid for prescription drugs. The higher debt levels are a plausible result of Latinos’ lower rates of insurance coverage, since out-of-pocket costs tend to be higher for the uninsured.14 

In total, Latinos with medical debt on their credit cards report it amounts to an average of $1,521 or 25 percent of their average total credit card debt. In addition, approximately a third of indebted Latino households also have medical debt that is not on their credit cards—an average of $3,648, down significantly from $5,430 in 2008. This debt may be in the form of outstanding medical bills, medical bills that are being paid over time according to a payment plan, or payday loans or other types of personal borrowing used to pay for medical expenses. 
High medical costs—and the concern that they could lead to greater debt—deterred many indebted Latino households from pursuing recommended medical care, often in ways that could negatively affect their health. Most troublingly, half of indebted Latinos report that they did not visit a doctor or clinic when they had a medical problem in order to reduce medical expenses. This is significantly more than the 39 percent of indebted households overall who report this cost-cutting behavior. At the same time, 40 percent of Latinos report they skipped a medical test, treatment, or follow-up to reduce their medical expenses, while 36 percent of Latino households report that they did not fill a prescription or postponed filling a prescription to reduce medical expenses. Policies such as those enacted via the Affordable Care Act promise not only to cut health care costs and reduce medical debt, but can also decrease the incentives that lead households to sacrifice medical care in an effort to save money. In the meantime, credit cards can provide the immediate funds a family needs when faced with an emergency, but at the cost of additional debt and interest payments.
 

Discriminatory treatment and fraud targeting
	Latino cardholders
In addition to the broad opportunities and challenges of credit access and credit card debt, the Latino community also faces a disproportionate share of credit card scams and episodes of discriminatory treatment. In a wide-ranging recent report on consumer fraud in the United States, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) found that Latinos were more likely than whites to have been victims of consumer fraud, particularly debt-related scams such as false promises to reduce credit card debt, provide credit card “insurance,” or reduce interest rates for a substantial fee.15 The FTC found numerous cases of credit card-related fraud victimizing Latino consumers in both English and Spanish, but suggested that consumers who try to handle complex financial transactions in English when they do not have full command of the language might be particularly susceptible to fraud. 
Language was also an issue in the federal government’s largest credit card discrimination settlement in history, a resolution reached with GE Capital Retail Bank in June 2014. In this case, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found that the bank excluded 108,000 credit cardholders from promotional programs it offered to help consumers with low credit scores and high credit card balances to reduce their credit card debt. According to the settlement, GE Bank “did not extend these offers to any customer who indicated that they preferred to communicate in Spanish or had a mailing address in Puerto Rico, even if the customer met the promotion’s qualifications. This meant that Hispanic populations were unfairly denied the opportunity to benefit from these promotions… [these] the customers did not receive either offer in any language, including English, and did not know they were being discriminated against.”16 Ultimately, the company agreed to pay $169 million to the cardholders in compensation and to pay additional fines for its misconduct. 
“Consumers deserve to be treated fairly no matter where they live or what language they speak,” announced Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Richard Cordray. Unfortunately, the continued prevalence of credit card fraud and discrimination targeting the Latino community indicates that fair treatment is not yet a reality.
Unemployment and credit card debt
With 2.4 million Latinos out of work in 2012 and another 2.5 million either under-employed or marginally attached to the labor force, it is not surprising that expenses associated with job loss were cited as one of the greatest contributors to Latino households’ credit card debt over the past three years. The unemployment rate for Latinos was 10.3 percent in 2012, compared to 8.1 percent for all households.17 Nearly one in four indebted Latinos report that in the last three years they or a member of their family has lost a job or been unemployed for at least 2 months. Among the households experiencing unemployment, 87 percent report it has contributed to their current level of credit card debt. Overall, nearly 1 in 5 Latinos with credit card debt say that a layoff or other loss of a job is the expense that contributed most to their current level of credit card debt. This proportion is not statistically different from the 15 percent of indebted households overall reporting that job loss was the main contributor to their current credit card debt.
Paying down debt and saving: optimism and challenges
Digging out of debt can be a slow process for anyone, but Latinos are more optimistic about paying down their credit card debt swiftly than indebted Americans as a whole—53 percent predict they will be completely out of credit card debt in just six months, compared to 43 percent of indebted households overall. This is a reversal from our survey findings in 2008, when Latinos were less likely than others to think they would be completely out of credit card debt in six months. 
However, there are reasons to be cautious about the prospects for paying off credit card debt: while Latino households’ average credit card balance is lower than the average of other indebted households, Latinos also report that they pay less per month—an average $483 on their credit cards in the past month, compared to $566 for all indebted households. At the same time, Latinos pay higher average interest rates on their debt, meaning higher payments would be needed to clear their average credit card debt in a six month period. Finally, 36 percent of indebted Latino households report that they “always” or “usually” make only the minimum payment due each month on all of their credit cards. Paying only the minimum allows interest charges to accrue more quickly, making it more difficult to emerge from debt. 
Nevertheless, indebted Latino households report several solid strategies for paying down their credit card debt. Half of Latino households say they use tax refunds to pay down debt, while 38 percent report that they paid down debt by working extra hours or getting an additional job. Other popular strategies included drawing on savings (36 percent) and borrowing or receiving gifts of money from family or friends (19 percent). These common means of paying down credit card debt were not significantly different from responses of the indebted population as a whole.
In addition to paying down debt, building up savings helps households to stabilize their financial situations. Savings can provide vital resources to meet special expenses or emergency costs without having to go further into debt. The ability to save on a monthly basis is thus a key sign of financial health. In our sample of low- and middle-income Latino households with credit card debt, 60 percent of households responded that they were not currently saving money each month. The reason for not saving was overwhelmingly the same—79 percent of Latino households said “there is no money left over after paying all the bills.” There is also a widespread perception that saving money is becoming more difficult: 68 percent of Latino households report that it’s harder than it was three years ago to save, and 62 percent assert that it is harder to save than it was just one year ago. Yet Latino households’ monthly struggle to keep up with bills in the present is tempered by optimism about a brighter future where credit card debt will be paid down quickly.

The Credit CARD Act provides new protections to Latino borrowers
In May 2009, President Obama signed the Credit CARD Act into law, requiring credit card companies to comply with new standards of fairness and transparency for billing and fees. The CARD Act mandates that monthly credit card statements include new disclosures, detailing how long it will take to pay off the entire credit card balance if a consumer only pays the minimum amount due as well as information about interest and fees. In addition, the CARD Act eliminated some harmful practices such as card issuers’ ability to retroactively apply a higher interest rate to an existing credit card balance. Under the Act, companies must also provide adequate time for a consumer to receive and pay their bill before a late fee is imposed. While the benefits of the CARD Act have been felt by consumers broadly, Latino consumers have especially benefitted, reporting that they are now paying down debt more quickly and saving money by avoiding unfair fees. 
Ninety percent of indebted Latino households report that they noticed a change in their monthly credit card statements since the passage of the CARD Act, and many report that the new information has changed their behavior. In total, 38 percent of Latino households say the new disclosures about how long it will take to pay down their credit card debt has caused them to pay more toward their credit card balance in the typical month.

Overall, credit cardholders report that they are being charged late fees less frequently as a result of the CARD Act, and this is even truer of Latino households. As a result of the longer billing cycles mandated by the CARD Act, 41 percent of indebted Latino households report fewer late fees, compared to 26 percent of indebted households overall. The benefits are more clear when it comes to over-the-limit fees—one of the most abusive credit card practices documented before the passage of the CARD Act. These fees were charged whenever consumers spent more than their credit limit. The fees were regularly imposed without notifying consumers when they made the over-the-limit transaction, regardless of whether consumers would have preferred that transactions above the limit simply be denied. The CARD Act required consumer authorization for going over the credit limit, virtually eliminating over-the-limit fees. Overall, 22 percent of indebted households report that they have benefitted from the elimination of over-the-limit fees. Latinos have benefitted even more, with 36 percent reporting that they are now charged over-the-limit fees less often.
For Latino consumers in particular, the CARD Act has made credit cards a safer financial product, helping households to reduce their fees and pay down their balances more quickly.
Policy Recommendations
The financial crisis damaged household stability, but our survey shows that the trends pushing households into debt started long before the recession and they continue as the economy returns to normal rates of growth. The loss of vital public services and support for the programs that allow low- and middle-income families to prosper—like low cost educational opportunities, affordable health care services, and labor policies that provide a decent standard of living—made it increasingly difficult for families to get by without taking on debt. 
Americans should not have to rely on credit cards to supplement low pay and replace social support. Policies that give households the ability to survive without depending on debt are the primary means to put families back on stable ground. Our survey shows that 87 percent of indebted Latino households affected by unemployment expenses in the past year had to take on credit card debt as a result. As the economy continues a slow crawl toward previous employment levels, reducing barriers that keep laid-off workers from qualifying for unemployment insurance and extending eligibility for unemployment insurance to include more low-wage and part-time workers when they’re laid off can prevent hardship. At the same time, those who have jobs would benefit from the kind of workplace protections that promote living wages, affordable health and retirement benefits, and secure employment. Policies that ensure that all American jobs meet basic standards of decent employment would give low- and middle-income households the boost they need to make ends meet without reliance on credit. Raising the minimum wage, protecting the right to collective bargaining, and enforcing current labor standards all contribute more effectively to the ability of households to support themselves without taking on credit card debt. 
In addition to shared investments that put our country on the right track for workers and their families, our survey points to three areas where policy can make a difference in household budgets: medical debt, financial regulation, and credit reporting. 
Medical Debt Protection Emergency health expenses can run into the thousands of dollars and burden families for years after they have recovered from the physical trauma. In the decades since the 1970s, employers shed health care benefits as a provision of employment and households turned to debt to finance critical health expenditures. After decades without a policy response, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) finally offers a solution that can lower the individual cost burden for health care. Yet medical debt will not cease to exist, and the rising cost of health services and lower insurance rates among people of color make it difficult to guarantee adequate coverage and quality of care. Since medical debts continue to accrue, there must be fair and non-discriminatory practices for their collection. Medical lending practices should not be permitted to use evaluations of the total credit available to patients. The appropriate financial services guidelines for health care facilities should be under the purview of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Moreover, as unexpected medical expenses offer little information about the character of the consumer, medical debt should excluded from credit scores altogether. 
Borrower Security Many moderate-income Latino households rely on credit to make investments in their futures, and often just to meet their basic needs. Because credit plays an essential role in the financial security of Americans, it should be governed by fair and responsible practices. The CARD Act began the industry reforms necessary to establish prudent guidelines and accountability for credit card companies. Federal legislation protecting borrowers by setting national usury limits, indexed to a federal rate, would complement the provisions of the CARD Act. Such legislation would provide borrower security by eliminating unjustifiably high interest rates on credit products ranging from credit cards to student loans and limiting late fees to $15 per late payment. Several states have already enacted reforms that cap the interest rates of high-cost payday loans, showing the possibilities for state and local legislation to regulate the industry and protect consumers. 
Fairness in Bankruptcy Indebted Latino households need reasonable and straightforward options as they work toward restoring their balance sheets. As a last resort, declaring bankruptcy should provide the opportunity for families to reconcile their debts, including mortgage and student debt. In order to make bankruptcy a fair option to consumers, bankruptcy law should permit courts to restructure the debt on home mortgages by setting interest rates and principal at commercially reasonable market rates and extending repayment periods, allow judges to reduce the mortgage principal on a primary residence to the current value of the home, and to discharge student loan debt. Incorporating student loans into bankruptcy policy will make it possible for families to work for a better future without being crippled by the cost of education. 
Fair and Accurate Credit Scores Our survey found that Latino households are less likely than whites to report a good or excellent credit score, aligning with a larger body of research showing that credit scores correlate with race and ethnicity. The CFPB could play a stronger role in this area, beginning with improvements in the transparency, validity, and appropriate use of credit reports and scores to ensure accuracy and accessibility of credit reports and the regulation of reporting information. In addition, all medical debt, disputed claims, and unsafe credit products should be excluded from credit reports, steps the CFPB is already taking in the case of medical debt. The improvement of reporting and access would reduce the biases in credit scores and improve the economic security of both borrowers and lenders.
Ban Employment Credit Checks Today, employers commonly look into the credit histories of job candidates as part of the hiring decision. While there is no evidence linking credit reports to trustworthiness or dependability, credit reports have repeatedly been shown to have race and income biases that make the practice of employment credit checks highly discriminatory.18 Using credit reports as criteria for hiring exacerbates the economic hardships facing households that may have had a medical emergency, a divorce, a layoff, or other economic impacts beyond their control. Ten states have already passed legislation limiting the use of employment credit checks because of these issues. We suggest that the US adopt the Equal Employment for All Act, a federal law establishing uniform restrictions on credit checks for employment. 
Regulating Non-traditional Lenders The exorbitant interest rates that accompany payday loans—with rates as high as 400 percent annually—can trap consumers in a spiral where low income requires increasingly high borrowing, even for small loans.19 Although more than 12 million Americans turn to this source of credit each year, the industry preys on borrowers in the weakest financial positions who use the loans for basic living expenses like rent, utilities, food, and emergency repairs.20 Federal legislation could be modeled on strong usury laws at the state-level that prohibit payday lending entirely, or restrict it with double-digit caps on the allowable interest rate. To date, 17 states and Washington, DC, have enacted legislation capping the allowable interest rate on payday loans. Other laws limit the maximum amount and length of borrowing in the industry; according to the Center for Responsible Lending, one such law has already saved consumers more than $122 million in fees.21 In addition to direct regulation of non-traditional lenders, the federal government should encourage affordable alternatives for the populations most likely to rely on last-minute emergency loans.
Extend the Successes of the CARD Act The CARD Act is working for American households by standardizing best practices industry-wide. Our research and recent data from the CFPB show that consumers are better equipped to make informed choices and less subject to abuses in the areas addressed by the legislation—such as fair and transparent pricing.22 The provisions of the CARD Act include protections that grant consumers better knowledge and control over their finances, including requiring credit card providers to make the due dates for payment the same each month, allocating payments made above the monthly minimum to the highest interest rate balance first, and eliminating high-fee over-the-limit spending unless customers explicitly opt-in to the service. American households have seized this opportunity to pay down balances and avoid fees.
Some card issuers responded to the legislation with voluntary product improvements, including an increased commitment to customer service and attention to received complaints.23 Yet problems of inadequate transparency and injurious costs remain. In their evaluation of the CARD Act, the CFPB identified a number of areas where credit card companies could promote higher standards of service. The best practices would treat add-on products, such as supplementary protections and credit monitoring, with the same standards of transparency and disclosure as are required for lines of credit, even when provided through third-party contracts. Application fees—currently excluded from the standard imposed by the CARD Act that states that fees cannot exceed 25 percent of the total credit line in the first year—would be included in the first-year calculation of fees to ensure that the ratio of costs to credit remains reasonable. Moreover, a high standard for clear disclosure related to rewards programs, grace periods, and products that defer interest for an introductory period, would complement the practices already covered by the CARD Act.

"“How can you pay your debt, if you can’t get a job?” That’s the straight-forward question Council Member Debi Rose asked on the steps of New York’s City Hall this morning, as she stood up as a lead sponsor of legislation which would ban discrimination against job applicants and employees based on their personal credit histories.  
Council Member Rose continued:
The practice of using credit checks as part of the employment application process is pernicious – often preventing people from disadvantaged backgrounds, who are more likely to have a bad credit rating, from getting a job; it also impacts college graduates, who are coming out of school with unprecedented debt levels. The bottom line is that this practice is keeping people who want to work, and who can work, from working, for no justifiable reason. Let’s end it now.
Demos’ research on employment credit checks backs up the Council Member’s point: credit checks keep qualified workers out of a job. Despite a lack of evidence linking personal credit history to job performance or a likelihood to commit fraud or any other crime at work, nearly half of employers report that they use credit checks to screen job applicants for some or all positions. The reason is simple: the nation’s for-profit credit reporting companies, which developed credit reports as a tool for lenders, have sought new markets for their product and aggressively marketed them to employers—evidence be damned.
As Demos’ 2013 study reveals, credit checks in hiring have a discriminatory impact on people of color whose credit histories may reflect the damage done by predatory lending that continues to target communities of color, as well as the enduring impact of racial discrimination in employment, lending, education, and housing. We also find that weak credit history is often linked to medical debt and unemployment. And then there are the errors: a study by the Federal Trade Commission this year found that 21 percent of consumers had a material error on a credit report, with unpredictable effects on hiring.
New York City will not be the first jurisdiction to restrict the use of credit history in hiring—ten states have already taken action to restrict the practice. But as the New York Times noted in an editorial, these laws are full of unjustified exemptions that need to be tightened. By passing legislation without industry carve-outs, New York is poised to be a progressive leader in ending a particularly insidious form of employment discrimination.
On the steps of City Hall this morning, Debi Rose was joined by the bill’s main sponsor, Council Member Brad Lander, as well as City Council Members Ydanis Rodriguez, Margaret Chin, Mark Levine, Carlos Menchaca, Corey Johnson, and Helen Rosenthal, who are among the bill’s co-sponsors. Members of the NYC Coalition to Stop Credit Checks in Employment, including unions like RWDSU and DC37 as well as organizations such as NYPIRG, the New Economy Project, the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, Retail Action Project, Demos and a host of legal services organizations were out in force.
The message was clear: the time has come for New York City to stop employment credit checks and be a leader in the fight to end employment discrimination.",blog
"You probably haven’t seen the terms of the new Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal currently being negotiated by the Obama Administration. Unless you’re one of “600 trade ‘advisers,’ dominated by representatives of big businesses, who enjoy privileged access to draft texts and negotiators” the deal is secret and we know its terms only through select leaks, according to Lori Wallach and Ben Beachy of Public Citizen’s Global Trade Watch.
In their opinion article in Monday’s New York Times,  Wallach and Beachy note that the deal “could rewrite broad sections of nontrade policies affecting Americans’ daily lives.” The consequences could be profound. For example, Demos has argued that expanding the American middle class and making it as diverse as the nation itself will require policies such as leveling the playing field for American manufacturing and banning predatory consumer loans. Yet Wallach and Beachy note that leaked sections of the trade deal “would include even more expansive incentives to relocate domestic manufacturing offshore… [and] would practically forbid bans on risky financial products.”
So much for the middle class.
But don’t We the People get a say in this? Wallach and Beachy write:
Of course, the agreement must eventually face a Congressional vote, which means that one day it will become public.
So why keep it a secret? Because Mr. Obama wants the agreement to be given fast-track treatment on Capitol Hill. Under this extraordinary and rarely used procedure, he could sign the agreement before Congress voted on it. And Congress’s post-facto vote would be under rules limiting debate, banning all amendments and forcing a quick vote.
Ron Kirk, until recently Mr. Obama’s top trade official, was remarkably candid about why he opposed making the text public: doing so, he suggested to Reuters, would raise such opposition that it could make the deal impossible to sign.
In Demos’ recent landmark paper, “Stacked Deck” David Callahan and Mijin Cha argue that a tilting of political life toward business and the wealthy has served to undermine economic mobility in America. The proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership looks like a very powerful case in point.",blog
"Let’s say you have a lucrative industry. Businesses are expanding. Profits are healthy. So what kind of paychecks are the workers bringing home?
From the end of World War II through the early 1970s, median and minimum wages tracked productivity. A rising tide lifted most boats. You could expect that in an industry doing well, workers would share in the bounty. As the Economic Policy Institute points out, that hasn’t been the case economy-wide for a long time: between 1979 and 2012, productivity grew 74.5 percent, while wages inched up just five percent. Looking just at the last decade, data suggests that productivity growth isn’t being shared with workers in the middle or at the bottom.
So how are the workers in our booming industry doing? If you’re talking about supermarkets and other food retailers in California, a new report by Saru Jayaraman and the Food Labor Research Center, University of California, Berkeley has bad news: steady growth in sales and employment was accompanied by a 16.7% decline in the weekly wages of full-time workers between 2000 and 2010. In an industry that used to provide economic security and a foothold in the middle class, it is now common for workers to go hungry.
The report carefully teases out a variety of causes for the decline of good jobs in the California grocery industry, but what stands out is the decline of unionization and union power. Driven by the expansion of non-union retailers Target and Walmart into the food retail market, unionized supermarkets in California lost market share and sought to imitate their rivals’ low-wage strategies, pushing down pay and sending profits to Wall Street rather than investing in the workforce. While working in a union store still offers distinct benefits in pay, benefits, schedules and advancement opportunities as compared to non-union grocery work, union wages for California grocery workers have fallen precipitously and the number of union workers has shrunk. In a nutshell, wages fell as the industry expanded because workers didn’t have the power they once did.
But what if our booming industry is hotels in New York City? Like food retail in California, it’s a service industry that’s thriving. And like work as a grocery cashier or shelf stocker, employment as a hotel housekeeper or bellman requires little formal education. But thanks to a new citywide contract negotiated by the hotel workers’ union, New York’s 32,000 union hotel workers will stay “very much in the middle class” in the words of union president Peter Ward. Under the terms of the tentative contract, hotel housekeepers, who currently earn $27.41 an hour with fully-paid health care, will see their wages rise a dollar a year over the next decade, reaching annual pay of nearly $70,000 plus benefits by 2024. (Disclosure: I was worked for the New York Hotel Trades Council between 2002 and 2004. I can attest that the care offered by the union-run health clinics was excellent. For more background, see Robert Kuttner’s excellent article on the union)
There are numerous differences between the California grocery industry and New York City hotels. But it seems clear that the extent to which workers are empowered to get a better deal on the job has played a large role in their wage trajectories and diverging fates. And yet the role of worker power often gets overlooked the mainstream conversation about inequality and inadequate wages. Discussions of fast food worker organizing, for example, focus on the call for a $15 an hour wage, frequently glossing over workers’ other demand for the right to form a union without retaliation.
The focus on wages to the exclusion of worker power may be about to change. When President Obama signed an executive order in January to raise wages for low-paid federal contract workers, it was a concrete victory for hundreds of thousands of employees working on behalf of America. At the same time, no one can be under the illusion that $10.10 an hour is sufficient to turn around the lives of working people. In addition to a raise, Change to Win Deputy Director Joseph Geevarghese told Businessweek “workers need a voice at the table.” That means the right to bargain collectively in return for labor peace, a concept my Demos colleagues will explore further in an upcoming paper.
A minimum wage hike sets a critical floor on the labor market, but it is worker power that ensures that working people will see the gains of a growing, productive economy—and the industries within it.",blog
"Mother’s Day won’t arrive until Sunday, but the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions is already looking beyond it. And rightly so: this morning’s committee hearing, “Beyond Mother’s Day: Helping the Middle Class Balance Work and Family”  takes an expansive view of how public policy and business practices succeed and fail to support the important work that mothers, fathers and other caregivers do to sustain their families. “A secure family,” as Committee Chair Tom Harkin announced at the start of the hearing, “is a very important piece of the American dream for our middle class. This means more than financial security. It means having a good family life and being able to spend time together.  It means being able to care for your children and your parents when they need you, and to know they are well-taken care of when you can’t be with them.”  
Ann O’Leary, of the Center for the Next Generation in San Francisco, framed the issue powerfully: family work patterns are changing as the vast majority of families depend on the earned incomes of mothers; the needs of children are changing as they increasingly face health and educational challenges that demand greater time and attention from parents; and the demographics of our society are changing to leave working people with increased responsibilities to care for ailing and elderly parents; America’s workplace policies have not kept pace.
Workers and their families need paid sick days to protect their health and economic security, explained Judith Lichtman of the National Partnership for Women and Families. Two out of three low-wage workers in the U.S. – the employees who can least afford to miss a paycheck – do not have a single paid sick day to recover from illness or take care of sick child or relative. These workers must choose between losing a day’s pay or coming to work sick, endangering their own health and the public. Many low-wage workers even risk losing their jobs and health coverage if they call in sick. According to one survey, one in six Americans says that they or a family member have been fired, suspended, punished, or threatened by an employer for missing work due to illness. The result is a more fearful and precarious low-wage labor force, just one illness away from slipping into poverty.
An excellent first step would be the Healthy Families Act, which would enable working people to earn up to seven paid sick days a year to recover from illness, care for a sick family member, visit a doctor or seek assistance related to domestic violence. The bill, introduced as stand-along legislation as (S. 984/H.R. 1876), is also incorporated into Senator Harkin’s Rebuild America Act.
Paid family and medical leave is another critical policy component. The Family and Medical Leave Act,  passed in 1993, was intended to provide some security to families facing a sudden illness, providing family care, or welcoming a new child. The law guarantees 12 weeks of unpaid leave to Americans working at businesses with 50 or more employees. Employers cannot replace workers on FMLA leave or retaliate against them in any way. Since its implementation, workers have used FMLA leave more than 100 million times. But four in ten American workers are not eligible because they work for smaller companies or have not been on the job long enough, and millions of Americans cannot afford to take leave without pay. Because only a small proportion of employees receive paid leave benefits directly from their employers, working Americans are still forced to risk their incomes and jobs to maintain their families.  Employees of small companies lack any federal protection whatsoever. The solution is to broaden the reach of the Family Medical Leave Act and establish an insurance system to offer paid family leave based on the successful models in California and New Jersey.
Scholarly and policy perspectives aside, by far the most moving testimony was offered by New York City retail worker and mother Kimberly Ortiz. Describing her life as the low-wage single parent of two autistic boys, Ms. Ortiz asserted:  “ A few paid sick days a year, a set schedule, and wages that keep up with the rising cost of living would make a tremendous difference in my family’s life.  As a single mother, I need to be present for [my children] Ethan and Aiden, and provide for them. This is what middle class means to me.”",blog
"The National Retail Federation was expecting a Mother’s Day bonanza on Sunday, predicting consumers would “spend more than ever… as they shower moms with everything from jewelry to special outings at favorite restaurants.” If their projections proved correct, many individual moms got a lot of love last weekend—or at least abundant gifts. Unfortunately, our society as a whole does a great deal less to honor and support mothers. Today, with health coverage for maternity care threatened, child care costs outstripping the price of college tuition, and  nearly a quarter of new mothers forced to return to work two weeks or less after giving birth, we are making it extraordinarily difficult for anyone but the very wealthy to be a mother at all.
The dollars and cents impact is clear: in the U.S. the drop in income associated with having a young child is a stunning $14,850 for households with two adults, after controlling for other factors, according to my findings in a study conducted last year with colleagues Robert Hiltonsmith and Tamara Draut. This is equivalent to 14 percent of household income. For single women, the drop in income associated with having a young child is equivalent to a devastating 36 percent of household income. For parents of color, the lower income level associated with having a young child is compounded by the broader labor market disadvantages faced by people of color.
The blow to income reveals a massive failure of public policy: the U.S. provides no respite from the trap that immediately ensnares families between the need to provide care for their children and the necessity of earning income. Something has to give.
This year, phony solutions to the crisis of care abound. Ivanka Trump, claiming to be a champion of “women who work,” has promoted a child care plan that primarily benefits high-income households, and a paid leave plan that shuts out many families entirely. Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress are pushing a scheme to let employers take away workers’ overtime pay in the name of employee “flexibility,” and replace it with comp time that could be used to care for family. Yet the mis-named “Working Families Flexibility Act” would still allow employers full discretion about when employees could use any comp time they had earned, leaving working parents with a pay cut but without any guaranteed ability to take paid time off when they actually need it. Instead, as the National Partnership for Children and Families points out, the bill “sets up a dangerous false choice between time and money, when working families urgently need both.” 
New York is among the states implementing better policy. By next Mother’s Day, working parents in New York State will have job-protected, paid leave under the New York State Paid Family Leave Program set to launch January 1, 2018. New York will finally join California, New Jersey, and Rhode Island on the short list of states that guarantee the critical leave benefits that virtually every other country on the planet already provides on a national basis. Meanwhile, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is developing plans to gradually expand the city’s successful universal preschool program for four-year-olds to three-year-old children as well, a move that promises to support both working parents and children’s learning.
If we want Mother’s Day to be more than a “greeting card holiday”—an economic boon to florists, jewelers, and restaurants—we need more strong policy like New York’s (and New York itself must act to reverse cuts to child care programs that will harm struggling families). There’s time to do far better for mothers (and fathers too) in Washington and in states and cities across the country by next Mother’s Day.  ",blog
"Middle-income Americans age 50 and older are carrying more credit card debt on average than younger people, according to Demos’ 2012 National Survey on Credit Card Debt of Low- and Middle-Income Households.1 That is a reversal of findings from a survey conducted by Demos in 2008.
AARP’s Public Policy Institute collaborated with Demos to produce this report. It reveals a troubling picture of middle-income 50+ households carrying card debt near or in their retirement years. The report shows that older households carried an average credit card balance of $8,278 in 2012. For those under 50, credit card debt averaged $6,258. Other key findings for middle-income households that carried credit card debt for three months or more:
This report suggests that credit card debt among older Americans is primarily a reflection of difficult economic times, not a lack of personal financial responsibility.

"Employers should pay their workers enough to live on and support their families.
My colleagues and I at Demos have joined our fellow advocates and researchers in making the point repeatedly: delving deeply into the cases of retail workers (in the industry generally  and at Walmart  specifically), fast food employees, and people employed by companies that do business with the federal government. We’ve argued for raising the minimum wage at the federal, state, and local levels, and have cheered on private companies that voluntarily decided to raise base worker pay, including the Gap,  Ikea, and – as Ross Douthat pointed out in his column in the Sunday New York Times  – Hobby Lobby. Simply put, when all workers are paid enough to support themselves, the economy is stronger, our families and communities are stronger, and businesses themselves benefit from increased worker morale and productivity, reduced absenteeism, and greater employee retention.
It was in this context that blogger Brenden Timpe wrote on our blog last year in praise of Hobby Lobby’s wage hike. Reading Timpe’s post, Douthat sees a clash between religious liberty and cultural liberalism. The political left, he argues, is doing itself a disservice by critiquing the religious choices of organizations, like church-run soup kitchens, that otherwise serve goals we support. “Insist that for legal purposes there’s no such thing as a religiously motivated business,"" he argues, ""and you will get fewer religiously motivated business owners"" who will be motivated by their values to raise wages.
In other words, Douthat maintains that if progressives like it when religiously motivated employers pay their workers well, we should look the other way on other policies. In Hobby Lobby’s case, this includes advancing a legal principle that will undermine the rights of workers across the country, and undercut government’s ability to create systems that support workers, whether it comes to birth control or any other idea that might offend an employer’s religious beliefs. That’s hardly an acceptable compromise.
As Demos President Heather McGhee points out, “corporations are creations of the state and they must serve the public interest. What is especially dangerous about the Hobby Lobby decision is that it continues to advance the fallacy of corporate personhood and makes the corporate entity supreme over our democratic decision-making about what’s in the public interest -- in this case affordable health care for women and their partners.”
It’s a positive thing when employers -- motivated by religious values, pragmatic business concerns, or any other consideration – choose to go beyond the floor set by the law to lift up their workers. But we’d be better off with more strong employee protections and workers’ rights so we don’t need to rely on the whims of corporate leaders who choose which rights and benefits to bestow.",blog
"Today, women make up nearly half of America’s workforce, and there is little question that their success in the economy is critical to the nation’s prosperity. Yet every day across America, millions of women go to work in low paying jobs that fail to move their families out of poverty. 
Download the full report
One such low-paid position is the most common occupation in America today: retail salesperson. The typical woman working as a salesperson earns just $10.58 an hour: a wage that keeps a family of three near poverty, even if the employee is able to secure enough hours for full-time work. American women disproportionately hold the retail industry’s lowest-paid positions. Jobs that could be a source of stability to families and growth for the national economy too often involve not only low pay but erratic schedules, a lack of sufficient work hours, and the scarcity of basic benefits like paid sick days—making hourly retail jobs precarious positions holding back not just women but their families and our nation as a whole. 
Retail is far from the only low-paying sector of the American economy. Yet because it is one of the top industries employing women, and one projected to add a substantial number of new jobs over the coming decade, the choices the nation’s major retailers make about employment will play a crucial role in determining the nation’s economic future. 
This study looks at the retail industry as it is today for the 7.2 million American women employed in its ranks, as it will look in 2022 if present trends continue, and as it could be if the nation’s largest retailers—companies employing at least 1,000 workers—raised wages and improved employee schedules. 
Building on our previous study, “Retail’s Hidden Potential” we provide an updated assessment of establishing a new wage floor for the lowest-paid retail workers equivalent to $25,000 per year for a full-time, year-round retail worker at retail companies employing at least 1,000 workers. We explore the implications of this wage hike for female retail workers in particular. We find that for the typical woman in retail who earns less than this threshold, the new floor would mean a 27 percent pay raise. Including both the direct effects of the wage raise and spillover effects, the new floor will impact more than 3.2 million female retail workers and their families in addition to 2.5 million male retail workers and their families. For a full description of the study methodology, see the appendices.
The lack of sufficient work hours and predictable, stable schedules for hourly retail workers is another obstacle for women trying to work their way out poverty. This study considers the rise of just-in-time scheduling in retail industry, a growing practice in which retail employers use scheduling software and measures of consumer demand to match workers’ hours to the projected need for labor on a daily or even hourly basis. As a result, workers often do not know how many hours they will work in a given week or month: their incomes fluctuate and workers cannot budget effectively. Ever-changing schedules make it more difficult for working mothers to plan child care arrangements, for workers to get education or training that could help them get a better job, and for employees trying to supplement their incomes with a second job to establish a compatible schedule. In effect, unstable and unpredictable schedules deprive women in retail of both immediate income and opportunities to rise up. 
The retail industry today faces a crucial choice. As the industry grows in the coming years, will its largest companies shift toward wages and schedules that allow hard-working women in retail to rise out poverty, boost the economy, and promote broad societal benefits such as improved public health and opportunity for the next generation? Or will they continue on the present course, including the 28-cent pay gap in sales and related occupations, and billions of dollars in taxpayers subsidies to large and profitable companies that don’t pay their employees enough to live on? This is retail’s choice.

Wages that raise families out of poverty, or push them into it?
Wages that boost the economy, or sink it?
Schedules that lift up women, their families, and communities, or undermine them?
Large retailers can afford to improve women’s jobs—without big price increases.
The retail industry has tremendous potential to offer good, family-sustaining jobs to the 7.8 million American women projected to work in the industry in the next decade. If large retailers take action, employees, their families and communities, and our economy as a whole will benefit. If companies fail to change course, poverty jobs in retail will increasingly drag us down.

"Here’s one especially for the folks who, while vehemently attacking the Chicago teachers’ strike, insist that they generally love and support organized labor.  Warehouse employees in southern California would greatly benefit from your outpouring of solidarity. Today, as they begin a 50-mile march  from Inland Empire warehouses to Downtown Los Angeles, they could use everyone’s support.
Yesterday about three dozen employees of a Southern California warehouse that stores goods for Walmart walked out on strike.  According to their organization, Warehouse Workers United:
Workers face inadequate access to clean water, work under scorching heat that reaches well over 100 degrees, and have little access to basic healthcare, regular breaks, and properly functioning equipment. Their wages are low –$8 per hour and $250 a week, or $12,000 per year. Workplace injury is common.
But when workers tried to offer solutions to fix these abuses, they have been met with illegal threats and intimidation by management.
Because of this intimidation, the fragmented nature of their employment, and the failure of the nation’s labor laws to protect the right to organize, workers have not been able to join a formal union, and their many charges of unfair labor practices are still pending before The National Labor Relations Board. Nevertheless, they bravely walked off the job and will march today joined by clergy members and labor leaders.
Formally, the workers are employed by warehouse and logistics firm NFI Industries and by temp agencies. But power over their wages and working conditions is really held by the company whose goods they store and move: Walmart. As the nation’s (and the world’s) biggest retailer, Walmart sets the standard for how subcontractors operate. As the National Employment Law Project documented  in a recent report, Walmart “bears direct ties to and control over the subcontractors and third-party employers that handle much of the company’s domestically outsourced work” and could put an end to the health, safety, and wage abuses that have become more prevalent as it outsources warehouse and distribution functions.
Supporters of the strike and march are asked to sign on to a letter to Walmart’s CEO, Executives, and Board of Directors asking them to meet directly with the workers to discuss working conditions.",blog
"Household debt is burdening millions of families and stifling economic growth in the nation as a whole. In the first half of 2011, 11 million American households – more than one in five homeowners – owed more on their mortgages than their homes were worth.1 Millions of families have already lost their homes to foreclosure. Meanwhile, the nation’s outstanding student loan debt is likely to top an unprecedented $1 trillion this year, and student loan default rates are rising.2 As Americans struggle to pay back debt, they have less to spend and invest, creating a drag on economic recovery. These staggering debt levels are compounded by bankruptcy rules that direct the flow of money toward banks and other mortgage lenders rather than American households.
The forces at play go far beyond personal responsibility and have battered even those who played by the rules. The nation’s $8 trillion housing bubble was less a problem of borrowers who lived beyond their means than of mortgage brokers and lenders who made irresponsible and often predatory loans while lax government regulators looked the other way. Yet individual homeowners have been left to watch their single largest family asset plummet in value. Similarly, states have defaulted on their historic commitment to funding higher education, contributing to the growth of college tuition even as family incomes have stagnated.3 For many students, borrowing is the only way to finance an education, even as high unemployment for recent graduates makes it difficult to pay loans back.4 High interest rates for private student loans and questionable marketing practices by student lenders contribute to making student loan debt unsustainable.
Bankruptcy is the traditional last resort for Americans overwhelmed by debt they cannot pay. The ability to discharge debts in an orderly way was seen as such a critical part of the nation’s economy from its founding days that the U.S. Constitution explicitly grants Congress the power to establish national laws on bankruptcy.5 Scholars have even linked America’s comparatively lenient personal bankruptcy laws to the nation’s entrepreneurial dynamism, arguing that ability to make a fresh start is essential to the willingness to take risks that may ultimately pay off.6
But in 2005, Congress and the Bush Administration clamped down on bankruptcy filings, placing hurdles in the path of Americans trying to file and making it more difficult to discharge debts. In particular, the 2005 law made private student loan debt, like federal student loans, impossible to discharge in bankruptcy except under a difficult to meet hardship exemption. Today, bankruptcy allows for the discharge of credit card debt and auto loans but not student loan obligations. At the same time, the law permits judges to modify loans used for commercial real estate, vacation homes, and even yachts, but not a family’s primary residence. Two of the largest investments Americans make in order to enter the middle class – in their homes and their educations – are thus excluded from the relief offered to other debtors.
By enabling bankruptcy judges to write down mortgages to the current value of the home, the Fairness in Bankruptcy Act would make it more affordable for Americans to stay in their homes, reducing foreclosures at no cost to taxpayers and powerfully stabilizing the housing market. Knowing that homeowners have the option to reduce their principal in bankruptcy would also give lenders a greater incentive to mortgage reductions long before a borrower even considers bankruptcy. Finally, by allowing Americans to discharge student loan debt in bankruptcy, the policy will give young Americans battered by the recession a chance at a fresh start.
The mortgage sections of the Fairness in Bankruptcy Act are based on the Helping Families Save Their Homes in Bankruptcy Act, the major provisions of which were considered in various forms since 2008. One version of the bill passed the House of Representatives in 2009 but failed in the Senate. It is currently before Congress again as H.R. 1587. The student loan sections of this policy build on the Fairness for Struggling Students Act (S. 1102) but go beyond this bill to include federal as well as private student loans.

"""I served in the military for 30 years and received the highest level security clearances,"" said Brooklyn resident and war veteran Emmett Pinkston.  ""Yet I was turned down for a job as a TSA baggage screener, because of a bogus charge on my credit report.  I found myself stuck at a low paying job.""
Councilman Brad Lander speaks at a February 2013 rally to ban employment credit checks
On Wednesday, Pinkston joined the crowd amassed on the steps of New York City Hall, calling on the City Council to pass Intro. 857, the Stop Credit Discrimination in Employment Act,  which would bar local employers from using a job applicant's personal credit history as a factor in hiring decisions. The bill would help Pinkston and others land jobs they are otherwise highly qualified for.
Even as a representative of a major credit reporting company has admitted that there is no evidence linking credit reports to job performance or likelihood of criminal activity, nearly half of employers conduct credit checks as part of their hiring process. Poor credit may reflect errors on credit reports, as it did in Emmett Pinkston's case, or factors such as medical debt,  a messy divorce, predatory lending, or simply unemployment.
	In a nationally representative survey of low- and middle-income households carrying credit card debt, Demos found that households with members who have been unemployed as long as three years ago still report having worse credit:  41 percent describe their credit as ""fair"" or ""poor"" compared to just 24 percent of households on the survey population that have not experienced job loss in the past three years.

"My name is Roxanne Mimms and I work for a food service contractor at the National Zoo.  I work full time but make barely minimum wage. I’m here because workers can’t live off what contractors pay us.  I’m here because I don’t want my two children to grow up on public assistance.  I’m here because I have dreams – My American Dream is a good job with fair wages to provide for my children, being able to pay my bills on time and save for the future.  I’m here because I want to help all the workers at the National Zoo whose dreams are on hold.”
I was proud to stand with Ms. Mimms – and see her beautiful little ones – at the launch of Good Jobs Nation Wednesday morning in Washington, DC. Ms. Mimms and other employees working for federal contractors and other private businesses serving the American public joined together to speak out about their wages and working conditions. Faith leaders, community groups, and members of Congress, including Representatives Keith Ellison and Eleanor Holmes Norton, stood with them. The campaign seeks a living wage and a voice on the job for low-wage private sector employees working on behalf of America, many of whom could see their work standards lifted if President Obama chose to sign an executive order.
I had the opportunity to present the results of a new Demos study at the event. In “Underwriting Bad Jobs: How Our Tax Dollars Are Funding Low-Wage Work and Fueling Inequality,” my colleague Robert Hiltonsmith and I found that nearly two million private sector workers employed by government contractors, paid by federal health care spending, supported by Small Business Administration loans, working on federal construction grants, and maintaining buildings leased by the federal government earn $12 an hour or less (in some cases, much less). We the taxpayers are fueling a vast low-wage economy along the same lines as notorious low-road employers like Walmart and McDonalds, whose workers are also standing up for better treatment.
Historically, America has tried to do better than this. We have a long record of extending workplace protections to the people working on behalf of our country. Yet in the course of our research we discovered that prevailing wage laws including the Davis-Bacon Act, Walsh-Healey Act, and Service Contract Act are not enough to ensure decent standards for all private sector workers supported by our public dollars. When it comes to protecting workers, America is falling short of its vision.
At the same time, not everyone working on behalf of America earns low wages. Many senior executives at companies with federal contracts are doing very well for themselves. And we as taxpayers provide generous reimbursements to them. Today, federal contractors can be reimbursed for as much as $763,029 in compensation for any given employee. The President of the United States earns about half that much.
And so we are not just fueling low-wage work but we’re fueling the same trend toward inequality that we see having such a corrosive effect in our economy as a whole. In this case, that destructive inequality is maintained and exacerbated on the taxpayer’s dime.
Our study focused primarily on illuminating the problem, but we also looked at how it might be addressed.
Cities and states across the country have successfully used a range of different types of living wage laws and economic development agreements to raise job standards. They’ve found that the cost to taxpayers does not rise substantially when workers are paid decent wages. There are a number of reasons for this: companies that raise wages benefit from productivity gains and reduced employee turnover. By raising wages for these workers, there are also public savings due to the reduction in demand for public benefits. If people are paid enough to feed their families, they don’t need food stamps. As an earlier report from the National Employment Law Project has detailed, local living wage agreements could be a model for the federal government. For employees of federal contractors in particular, an executive order from the President could raise standards.
This affects all of us. When our tax dollars underwrite bad jobs, the economy as a whole is weakened and all of us are negatively affected. There is a ripple effect as low-paid workers and their families have little money to spend, hindering economic growth that could be creating more jobs. Poorly-paid workers also contribute less in taxes and are more likely to rely on public benefits to care for their families.

"Wal-Mart recently made headlines for increasing the starting salary of workers from $9 to $10 an hour, which would boost the wages of 500,000 employees, along with other boosts in specialized sections. While this step is a positive one, a new Demos brief argues that despite this new policy, Wal-Mart wages and schedules still aren’t livable. Demos finds that the new $10 an hour wage “still does not provide enough income to support the basic needs of a single adult working Walmart’s full-time schedule of 34 hours per week in any state in the country.”",media
"Now that’s a holiday gift! On Tuesday, NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that approximately 20,000 employees of New York City would be guaranteed paid parental leave—giving mothers and fathers critical time off to bond with a new baby, adoptee, or foster child without giving up a paycheck.  
Although paid leave for new parents is the standard worldwide, the United States guarantees zero paid time off for mothers or fathers. As a result, nearly 1 in 4 employed U.S. mothers return to work within two weeks of childbirth, according to research from former Demos fellow Sharon Lerner. This puts the health of parents and their babies at risk and weakens family economic stability. As I’ve argued before, a lack of paid leave also undermines women’s equality.
The mayor’s executive order will give municipal workers six weeks of paid leave at their full salaries, which can be combined with existing sick and vacation leave to provide up to 12 weeks of paid leave. And while the mayor cannot unilaterally change employment terms for New York’s 300,000 unionized employees, the city expressed willingness to start immediate talks with municipal unions about adding paid family leave for their members. City unions have responded that they are indeed interested.
Thanks to Mayor de Blasio’s leadership, employees of New York City can look forward to happier, healthier, and more economically secure times as they welcome new little ones in 2016 and beyond.
But it’s not just municipal employees who stand to benefit.
When President Obama took executive action this year to extend paid leave for federal workers, he argued that it would “help achieve the goals of recruiting and retaining talent, lowering costly worker turnover, increasing employee engagement, boosting employee morale, and ensuring a diverse and inclusive workforce.” A growing number of high-profile tech employers, from Netflix to Facebook to PayPal are expanding their paid leave policies with same aim. There is no reason New York City could not reap similar gains from the family-friendly policy.
At the same time, all New Yorkers—and all Americans—will benefit if New York City’s bold action inspires more momentum for change at the state and national level. Legislation to expand paid leave for all working people is pending in Congress, as well as in a number of states, including New York.  By extending paid leave to city workers, Mayor de Blasio could be putting this critical benefit a step closer for all of us.",blog
"Come April 2014, New Yorkers will finally have the right to get sick. Thanks to a New York City Council vote last night overriding Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s veto, New York will become the largest city in the nation to guarantee paid sick days. It’s an important milestone, even for those of us already fortunate enough to get a paid day off when we fall ill.
It means that the sneezing, coughing restaurant worker preparing our food can no longer be told, “if you don’t come in today, don’t bother coming in tomorrow.”
It means that the mother of the kid with disturbing flu-like symptoms can afford to stay home and keep her child in bed, rather than spreading sickness to every other student in the classroom and cafeteria.
It means the “sick passenger” won’t have to make a choice between earning the paycheck he needs to pay rent or clutching the subway pole with a germy hand just before you do.
And it means that one million more people will enjoy what 80 percent of Americans agree is a basic workers’ right.
In practical terms, the new law means New York City employers with at least 20 employees must now give their workers the opportunity to earn a maximum of five paid sick days a year beginning in April 2014. Businesses with fewer than 20 employees can no longer summarily fire workers who are unable to come to work due to illness, a surprisingly common occurrence.
I’ve argued before that the bill that has now become law is disappointingly diluted, and that brute political force ultimately mattered far more for its passage than the pile of sober research and careful analysis that indicated the policy would pay off with benefits that far exceed the modest costs. 
But beyond the reach of the legislation itself, the new law is also significant for its defeat of the “business boogeyman” an all-too-common line of reasoning that insists any advance for workers, consumers, or the environment must always come at the cost of an overwhelming loss to jobs and economic growth.
When he vetoed paid sick days in the first place, Mayor Bloomberg argued: “The bill will have deleterious effects on businesses. . . Faced with this increase in costs, employers will seek to offset them in any number of ways, including reducing other benefits employees receive ... reducing the number of hours employees work and laying them off altogether. Employers may also become less willing to hire new employees, as this bill would make hiring them more expensive.”
Set aside the apparently hypocrisy of hearing this from a mayor who was quick to adopt a ban on large sodas and indoor smoking in restaurants and bars – measures which could also increase costs to business – in the name of improving public health. In glibly repeating the line that granting paid sick days will inherently entail a loss of jobs or some other benefit, Mayor Bloomberg ignored the concrete evidence of what actually happened in San Francisco, Washington DC, and other cities where paid sick days have been guaranteed in favor of a the “business boogeyman” mantra – the same tired arguments  used to fight economic progress for working people since the Fair Labor Standards Act was signed 75 years ago.
Today, the New York City Council moves on to a discussion of wage theft in the fast food industry, meanwhile the Washington DC City Council voted to require big box retailers to pay a living wage, and New York’s paid sick days victory gives momentum for other states and cities trying to enact similar worker protections. Every one of these efforts will undoubtedly face attacks from the “business boogeyman.” New York’s success on paid sick days shows that it can be defeated, and our experience will ultimately provide one more piece of evidence that the knee-jerk argument is false. ",blog

The Financial CHOICE Act, subject of a hearing this Wednesday, would restore lost liberty by gutting consumer safeguards. Meanwhile, the House Education and Workforce Committee frets that workers miss out on “freedom, choice, and fairness” because they lack the opportunity to trade away overtime pay for the chance to ask the boss for time off.

"The Department's Proposed ""EAP Rule"" Fails to Sufficiently Safeguard Working People
Dear Ms. Smith:
Overtime rules that fairly compensate workers for the additional hours they work are critical to ensuring economic opportunity, particularly for people working in low-paying industries.
Demos objects to the Department of Labor’s proposed overtime rule (“Defining and Delimiting the Exemptions for Executive, Administrative, Professional, Outside Sales and Computer Employees)(“EAP Rule”) because it fails to sufficiently safeguard working people. Demos is a non-partisan public policy organization working for an America where we all have an equal say in our democracy and an equal chance in our economy. Overtime rules that fairly compensate workers for the additional hours they work are critical to ensuring economic opportunity, particularly for people working in low-paying industries.
The proposed rule inadvisably reverses the previous EAP Rule’s protections proposed by the Department just 3 years ago, and offers the fewest protections to workers in low wage industries who need overtime  protections the most. The current proposal fails to fix the key problem with current law: the proposed salary level is still far too low given that the duties test allows employers to exempt workers even when they perform a disproportionate amount of nonexempt work. This combination means that the proposed rule fails to adequately protect workers who are not Executive, Administrative, or Professional  employees in any meaningful sense.  
For these reasons, the proposed rule departs from decades of historical precedent and undercuts the purposes of the Fair Labor Standards Act’s overtime provisions. The Department must either raise the proposed salary level significantly or strengthen the duties test to truly capture only those who should be exempt in the final rule – and provide a concrete rule for regularly updating the salary level – in order to realize fully the promises of the FLSA.
Demos regards the Department’s proposal to modestly raise the salary level for the EAP exemption from $23,660 to $35,308 per year as entirely insufficient to assure that employees who can pass the current duties test are truly bona fide exempt EAP employees, who are supposed to have sufficient executive authority or independent discretion to manage their jobs and their hours. 
The Economic Policy Institute (EPI) has shown that under the current proposed salary threshold, 8.2 million workers who would have benefitted from the Obama Administration’s 2016 final rule will be left out. This number includes 3.1 million workers who would have gotten new overtime protections, and another 5.1 million workers who would have gotten strengthened overtime protections under the that rule.  Further, by setting the salary threshold so far below the 2016 rule, workers will lose $1.2 billion dollars each  year.  Raising the salary level would go a long way towards remedying this issue, as it would eliminate the need for a more stringent duties test, create a bright-line rule that will deter litigation, and reduce the number of workers who are inappropriately classified as exempt and underpaid. 
If the Department is not willing to raise the salary threshold high enough to adequately account for workers who should receive overtime, the Department should instead pursue a more restrictive “duties test” to bring this proposal in line with the FLSA and the purposes of the EAP exemption. Strengthening the duties test would also promote the proper classification of workers who have limited professional or managerial duties and who are not “bona fide” executives, administrators or professionals. For example, the Department could set a bright-line duties test requiring a strong majority of a worker’s work to be exempt, as the previous rules did, and as a couple of states have done. If the Department declines to raise the salary level, a more restrictive duties test is appropriate to remedy the mismatch and reduce inappropriate classification.
Finally, Demos is very concerned that the Department does not propose an automatic method for updating the salary level regularly.  The Department vaguely suggests that once every four years it intends to update the salary level through an NPRM published in the federal register, but this still requires months or even years of work with no assurance that future Departments will do so. Inaction leads to stagnant wages and contributes to wage inequality for workers, not to mention uncertainty and possible price shocks for employers. As discussed above, workers in particular stand to lose billions of dollars from the salary level proposed in this rule alone. These losses will be exacerbated by the lack of indexing – from $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion of lost wages over the first 10 years of implementation. 
Over time, the Department’s inaction in this area has already undermined the FLSA’s overarching purpose to extend pay protections broadly, spread employment, and exempt only  bona fide  “white-collar” workers from coverage. As currently proposed, this NPRM will have detrimental effects on workers and should be revised to raise the salary level, or in the alternative strengthen the duties test, and include the addition of a clear proposal for indexing.

"Thank you, members of the Committee for this opportunity to present testimony. I am a Senior Policy Analyst in the Economic Opportunity Program at Dēmos. We are a national, non-partisan research and advocacy organization, established in 2000 and headquartered in New York City. The Dēmos Economic Opportunity Program works to achieve a more equitable economy with opportunity for all. 
As the bill’s findings note, six out of ten American employers now look at a job applicant’s credit report when hiring for some or all positions.[1] A brief, informal survey of job listings throughout the state of Vermont reveals that employers today are requiring credit checks for positions as diverse as doing maintenance work, being an office assistant, working as a delivery driver, and supervising a stockroom.[2]
Employment credit checks have become commonplace because employers are looking for a way to predict if a potential employee will be honest, if they will handle money responsibly, if they are likely to steal or commit fraud.[3] For-profit credit reporting agencies take advantage of these concerns to market credit reports to employers. However, reviewing the social science research on this issue, I have found no credible evidence that credit reports reveal this information.[4]  In fact, a spokesperson for one of the major credit reporting agencies has admitted that he has seen no evidence to support the use of credit checks for employment purposes.[5]
It’s important to emphasize that credit reports evolved as a means for lenders to evaluate whether someone would be a good credit risk based on their past payment history. These reports detail whether someone has fallen behind on their bills, whether they have had to declare bankruptcy, and if they’ve faced foreclosure.  In fact, credit reports can be a good indicator of the tremendous economic stresses that are facing Vermont families during these difficult economic times.  Demos’ research on credit card debt among middle- and low-income households has found that most indebted families go into debt to pay for basic expenses: groceries, utilities, child care, and health care. In a 2008 survey we commissioned of low-and-moderate income households, 37% of credit card indebted families had used their credit cards to pay for basic expenses and 52% had used them to pay for medical care in the past year.[6] Simply put, Americans are borrowing to make ends meet.
You can often see the effects of that economic hardship in a credit report. What a credit report will not reveal is how well applicants are likely to perform on the job. The use of credit reports for employment purposes has no validity – and it’s our position that there is no job category in which they have proven to be useful or reliable.
In addition to their irrelevance, employment credit checks are also discriminatory, and I urge the committee to think of SB 3 as a piece of civil rights legislation. The reality is that employment credit checks disproportionately impact Latinos and African Americans, whose credit histories have suffered as a result of discrimination in lending, housing and employment itself.[7]  Employment credit checks can perpetuate and amplify this historic injustice. For this reason organizations including the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights, National Council of La Raza, and the NAACP have taken repeated stands against employment credit checks.[8] The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has sued two employers for the discriminatory impact of their use of credit reports as a hiring tool, demonstrating that credit reports may introduce legal liability to employers.
Another critical consideration is the accuracy of credit reports. A 2008 Federal Trade Commission (FTC)-sponsored pilot study found that about 31 percent of people who reviewed their credit report found errors that they wanted to dispute.[9] A 2011 study funded by the credit reporting industry itself found that 19.2 percent of people who reviewed their credit reports identified information that appeared to be erroneous.[10] Either way, this amounts to tens of millions of Americans whose credit reports contain information that is wholly inaccurate – perhaps someone else’s debts that became mixed up in their file, a mistake in the amount owed, or information wrongly stating that debts are still pending when in fact they were fully paid off.
Many jobseekers are not aware these errors exist, and if they find out, the burden for ensuring credit-report accuracy falls on the individual. If an individual uncovers a potential error in their credit report at a particular agency, the agency is required by law to investigate the matter and report back to the consumer within 35 days. However, as a practical matter, disputing an error can be a time-consuming, nearly impossible three-party negotiation between the credit bureau, the creditor and the individual—a negotiation for which the outcome is ultimately controlled by the sometimes arbitrary decision of the agency. We’ve heard of numerous cases where errors continued to appear on credit reports long after they were supposedly corrected.
I’d also like to raise the issue of privacy, because that is another concern as we consider employment credit checks. Americans should not have to expose the details a painful divorce or past medical condition just to get a job. Yet because family break-up and medical problems are among the leading reasons that Americans become unable to pay their debts, these deeply personal concerns are often revealed in an employment credit check, particularly if an applicant is asked by a prospective employer to “explain” their imperfect credit history. 
I would like to take a moment to address the exemption in this legislation. As it is currently written, S.43 permits the continued use of employment credit checks for positions for firefighters, police officers, employees of financial institutions, any position that requires a financial fiduciary responsibility, and anyone whose job would involve access to confidential financial information. 
The unwarranted exemption aside, S.42 will remove an unnecessary barrier that prevents qualified Coloradans from getting the work they need. By enacting this bill, the state will join the growing number of jurisdictions – including seven states, from California to Illinois to Connecticut – that have taken action to restrict the use of credit checks in employment. I urge you to pass this legislation. Thank you.

"“We should do everything we can to strengthen unions in this country,” said President Obama on Tuesday.
America was built by workers who over time, through a lot of struggle, got the right to bargain collectively.  I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say that our middle class was built in part because unions were able to negotiate weekends and overtime and benefits—things that now non-union workers take for granted.  Well, you got those because unions were out there fighting for you for a very long time.
The president made the remarks in response to a question at a manufacturing plant in Pittsburgh. And they raise a critical question of their own: what can the president do to strengthen unions—and workers’ rights more broadly—in the U.S.?
A new study, out today from my colleagues Robert Hiltonsmith and Lew Daly at Demos, addresses just that question. The study finds that 21 million Americans—eight million workers and their families—rely on low-wage jobs with firms that receive a significant portion of their revenue from federal funds. This vast workforce is employed by companies funded through federal contracts, Medicare and other health care spending, infrastructure grants, and more. Congress could take action to strengthen the right to organize and bargain collectively for all of them—and for every other worker in the public and private economies. But you don’t have to be a DC-insider to realize that this is unlikely to happen in the foreseeable future. What could happen is executive action.                     
President Obama has spoken of using “the power of the pen” to take executive and regulatory action on key elements of his agenda that are otherwise blocked by Congress—and he has acted. In February, Obama signed an executive order raising the minimum wage for federal contract workers. That action will benefit hundreds of thousands of contract workers and their families. More recently, the president has moved to advance equal pay for contract workers and to ban contracting companies from discriminating based on sexual orientation.
As part of an effort to “do everything we can to strengthen unions in this country” President Obama should take similar steps to strengthen the broad range of workplace rights for federal contract workers. Hiltonsmith and Daly propose a Good Jobs Policy that would:
incentivize and reward employers who adopt the highest employment standards, including: 
Read their study, Underwriting Good Jobs, for an examination of the working conditions of federal contract workers, as well as a look at how a Good Jobs Policy might work. Federal contract and concession workers have announced they will continue to strike and protest until the President acts to guarantee them a voice on the job.
If you agree that President Obama should take action, sign our petition calling for an executive order.",blog

"Washington DC needs jobs. When D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray made this point at a press conference this week, he may not have realized he was making a strong case in favor of the Large Retailer Accountability Act.
Consider the status quo. Right now, we allow large and profitable companies to get away with paying so little that their employees can’t afford to make ends meet. The low wages undermine the foundations of our economy. Workers don’t have enough money to spend on food, transportation, and other basic expenses, leaving local businesses without a customer base. The jobs that could have been sustained by employees’ consumer spending instead wither away. This dynamic explains a good deal of what’s happening in many of Washington’s neighborhoods – and in the nation as a whole.
	Families living in or near poverty spend nearly all of their income just to meet their basic needs, and when these employees receive an extra dollar in pay, they are likely to spend it immediately, spurring local job growth. A study by Demos found that if the nation’s big retail companies paid their lowest-wage employees at least $25,000 per year for a full-time, year-round work (a figure close to the $12.50 an hour required by the D.C. legislation) the economy would grow, GDP would increase by billions, and 100,000 or more new jobs would be created nationwide.
The study also found that the cost of a wage increase to consumers would be just cents more per shopping trip, on average.
And what about Walmart’s threat to not open three planned new stores in D.C. if the city requires it to pay its employees enough to live on? A 2007 study by economists at the University of California Berkeley Labor Center found that when a new Walmart store opens in a county, new jobs are not necessarily created. Instead, better paying retail jobs are replaced with lower-paying ones. At the same time, competitive pressure from Walmart pushes down wages in competing businesses. Earnings as a whole suffer and workers have less money to spend sustaining jobs in their communities.",media
"Dunkin Donuts is getting a sweet deal. The company enjoyed $108.3 million in profits last year and compensated its CEO, Nigel Travis, to the tune of $1.9 million. Meanwhile, the public paid an estimated $274 million to feed, provide medical care, and subsidize the wages of their workforce. And Dunkin Donuts is not alone or even the worst offender: new studies out today from the University of California, Berkeley Center for Labor Research and Education, the University of Illinois, and the National Employment Law Project detail just some of the vast scope of public subsidies for the fast food workforce.
The Berkeley/Illinois study finds that, overall, public assistance to workers in the fast food industry and their families costs nearly $7 billion a year. That includes public spending on Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, food stamps, the Earned Income Tax Credit and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families—but doesn't account for free school lunches, housing assistance, or home heating aid that families may also need to survive on median wages of $8.69 an hour.  
At wages that low, working more hours is still not enough to get by. Part-time fast food employees have the most difficult time making ends meet, but half of the fast food workers employed 40 or more hours per week still need to enroll their families in public assistance. Nor are these employees primarily teenagers picking up pocket money: an employee in the core fast food workforce is more likely to be a parent supporting children of her own than a teenager living in her parents’ home.
For the fast food corporations it’s a lucrative business model: they get labor at rates too low to keep families housed and fed, the public makes up the difference, and the company rakes in the profits.
But it’s not working for employees, who don’t like having to depend on public benefits despite their hard work—benefits are skimpy and the process of qualifying is often humiliating. As full-time Burger King employee Willetta Dukes of Durham, NC explains, “I stand on my feet eight hours a day… we’re not expecting to get rich, but why can’t I pay my light bill?”
Sleeping in a homeless shelter while punching the clock at KFC is no one’s idea of the good life. Nor is it good for families or our communities as a whole. It’s no wonder wave after wave of fast food strikes have broken out in cities across the country this year.
It’s clearly not working for the public either. Taxpayers forked over $1.2 billion last year to cover the costs of low wages and few benefits at McDonalds alone. Yet a federal minimum wage increase, which would force these companies to pay more, does not look imminent, despite the best efforts of Rep. George Miller and co-sponsors of HR 1010. We are also not strengthening our labor laws to ensure that fast food workers and others can safely exercise their rights to band together and negotiate for better wages and benefits on their own.
Instead, we’re talking about more cuts to the already-inadequate safety net workers and their families depend on. Those people who rely on food stamps? They should get a job.
Yet states and cities, like fast food workers themselves, are beginning to push back in ways big and small. The town of Seatac, WA is considering a $15 an hour minimum wage. Jersey City, NJ just opted to require employers to let workers earn paid sick days. The fast food industry's toxic business model should spur similar action across the nation.",blog
"Job security, with good wages and durable industries. A good education. A home to call your own. Affordable health care when you get sick. A secure retirement even if you’re not rich.
That’s President Obama’s understanding of the American middle class. And, in his major economic address in Galesburg Illinois this afternoon, the President acknowledged that this kitchen table vision of the American Dream was in danger. The broadly shared growth that led to a flourishing of the middle class in the years after World War II had stalled over the last 30 years:
Technology made some jobs obsolete. Global competition sent others overseas. It became harder for unions to fight for the middle class. Washington doled out bigger tax cuts to the rich and smaller minimum wage increases for the working poor. The link between higher productivity and people’s wages and salaries was severed – the income of the top 1% nearly quadrupled from 1979 to 2007, while the typical family’s barely budged.
 
Towards the end of those three decades, a housing bubble, credit cards, and a churning financial sector kept the economy artificially juiced up. But by the time I took office in 2009, the bubble had burst, costing millions of Americans their jobs, their homes, and their savings. The decades-long erosion of middle-class security was laid bare for all to see and feel.
The story is a far more accurate account of the trends shaping American’s daily lives than most of Washington’s political discourse. And there is no question that the President’s policy proposals would help to build a strong and diverse middle class – in fact, many resemble policies we’ve called for at Demos to do just that. If we did raise the minimum wage, make high-quality preschool available to all, invest in infrastructure and research and development, strengthen manufacturing, and enable students to go to college without taking on onerous levels of debt, the middle class would indeed be strengthened and more Americans would be able to work their way into its ranks.
It would also have been exciting to hear how the President would reverse trends that made it harder for unions to fight for the middle class (we’ve discussed some old and new ideas at Demos) but we can hope that’s coming in a later speech.
Yet powerfully as the President articulated his vision of an America “poised to reverse the forces that have battered the middle class for so long,” the dominant sense was one of profound frustration with an obstructionist Congress that lacks any economic plan beyond cutting spending and gutting laws protecting the nation.
The President vowed that Congress would no longer be an obstacle. For example, he would highlight companies like CostCo that recognize that paying their workforce livable wages is both good business and good for the country. It’s a wise strategy: our research suggests that if the nation’s large retail companies raised wages for their low-paid employees to just $25,000 per year, it would lift 1.5 million retail workers and their families out of poverty or near poverty, add to economic growth, and create over 100,000 new jobs – while also increasing sales for retail companies themselves.
If the President can successfully use his bully pulpit to get companies to act, the results could be profound. A particularly potent impact could be achieved if the President used his Administration’s connections to Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer and largest employer, to persuade the company to raise employee wages and respect its employees’ right to organize. Walmart is an industry trendsetter with an unparalleled capacity to reshape the landscape for retail work.
The President also vowed that “whatever executive authority I have to help the middle class, I’ll use it.” That’s a tremendously exciting proposition. To begin with, the President could make a big difference for at least one group of low-income Americans trying to climb into the middle class – workers employed by federal contractors. Our research finds that nearly two million private sector employees paid through federal funds earn wages too low to support a family, making $12 or less per hour. Through an executive order like the one that President Lyndon Johnson signed in 1965 to mandate equal employment opportunity for federal contract employees, President Obama has significant authority to improve many of the poorly-paid workers whose work is paid for with our tax dollars.
President Obama is right to commit the remainder of his presidency to reviving the American middle class. Both his legislative agenda and his executive actions have great potential for moving the nation forward.",blog
"Happy Food Day! The Center for Science in the Public Interest has designated October 24 as a day “to address issues as varied as health and nutrition, hunger, agricultural policy, animal welfare, and farm worker justice.” It’s a good idea, and to mark the occasion, I’d share an organic apple from my CSA if I could.
But community Supported Agriculture, home gardens, and farmers’ markets aside, most of what we eat doesn’t jump straight from the soil to our mouths. In many cases, there’s hard work in between from not only farm workers but also food processing plant workers, warehouse laborers, truck drivers, supermarket employees, and restaurant workers – all of whom could use a little more justice in their work lives. Regarded as a whole, the country’s food system is the leading employer of minimum wage workers nationwide. That means raising the minimum wage would do a tremendous amount of good for workers in the food system. What’s more, it would cost us eaters very little.
For just a dime day increase in food costs, explains a new report from the Food Labor Research Center, the Food Chain Workers Alliance and the Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, nearly 8 million food workers and 21 million workers in other industries would see their wages boosted by a minimum wage hike. The 10 cents per day cost estimate is based on average household spending on both restaurant meals and grocery bills.
The report analyzes the impact of the Fair Minimum Wage Act,  sponsored by Senator Tom Harkin and Rep. George Miller, which would increase the national minimum wage to $9.80 per hour over three years, would fix the minimum wage for tipped employees at 70 percent of the non-tipped minimum, and would index both to inflation. And if increasing the pay of more than 28 million working Americans isn’t enough reason to enjoy some sweet potato pie, the new report also reminds us of an analysis by the Economic Policy Institute finding that the Miller/Harkin minimum wage bill would add $40 billion to the economy  through higher wages, create 100,000 net jobs and boost the GDP by about $25 billion.

In addition to a substantial rate of occupational injuries, exacerbated by a requirement that some housekeepers clean as many as 30 rooms a day, the union also notes that Hyatt stands out for its aggressive use of subcontractors. In a particularly egregious case in 2009, Hyatt laid off long-time employees at hotels in Boston and permanently replaced them with even lower wage temporary workers. The New York Times reported that the laid-off housekeepers earned $14 to $16 an hour with health benefits, while the temp agency replacements were offered $8 an hour without health benefits.
Massachusetts’ governor denounced Hyatt’s move as “the worst nightmare of every worker in today’s weak economy.” The company, which declared $1.8 billion in gross profit in 2009 and $2.2 billion in 2011, countered that it faced “unprecedented economic challenges.” Accordingly, outsourcing has continued at Hyatt hotels across the country.
The systematic downgrading of the workforce – cutting wages, slashing benefits and reducing responsibility for employees even at profitable companies and in sectors like hotel work, where the labor cannot be sent overseas – can start to look inevitable. Yet, as Robert Kuttner detailed in the American Prospect last year, a different path, including good jobs and stable employment in the hotel industry, is viable and working in a strong union town like New York. His article suggests that when workers are able to organize and push back against low pay and mistreatment, good jobs can prevail. Given a strong union, employment in traditionally low-wage service sector positions can contribute to a stable middle class.   
As Hyatt housekeeper Cathy Youngblood asserts, “I don’t mind working hard, but I won’t be abused.”  UNITE HERE’s Hyatt campaign is an effort to push back against one particularly abusive employer. But it’s also an attempt at building the power of working people to demand more from profitable corporations bent on giving them less and less. As it kicks off a global boycott and national week of action, the union asks supporters to vote Hyatt the worst hotel employer in America and share their call for support.",blog

"How and why two types of theft—wage theft and shoplifting—are treated so differently.
Retailers put a great deal of resources into dealing with theft. They install security cameras, affix anti-theft tags to merchandise, and hire guards to protect stores. Signs warn that shoplifters will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. And yet another type of theft in the retail sector receives far less attention, even though it is equally, if not more pervasive in our economy: employers stealing pay they legally owe to their workforce. 
 
In a recent paper, the Economic Policy Institute calculated that employers steal $15 billion a year from workers’ paychecks by paying less than the minimum wage.1 As a result, hundreds of thousands of working families are pushed below the poverty line as large portions their paychecks disappear. Retail is one of the leading sectors for minimum wage violations. Yet the true scope of pay violations is far greater, both in retail and beyond: researchers find that requiring employees to work off-the-clock, work through meal breaks, or failing to adequately compensate employees for working overtime are even more widespread in the retail industry than minimum wage violations. Together these pay violations are known as wage theft.
This report compares the scope and impact of wage theft in the retail industry and beyond with the scale of shoplifting from retail stores. We aim to understand how and why these two types of misappropriation are treated so differently—even when both occur in a retail setting. We look at the resources devoted to stopping violators and the penalties for violating the law. We find that a retailer that steals millions of dollars in wages from its employees often faces a low risk of punishment and a far lighter penalty than the shoplifter who nabs a pair of shoes off its shelves. When corporations violate the nation’s core wage laws, working Americans are pushed into poverty, cities and states are robbed of tax revenue, and law-abiding businesses are put at a competitive disadvantage. While the consequences of wage violations can have a devastating impact on the lives of working people, companies know they are unlikely to be caught and that any penalties imposed will be mild. As a result, unscrupulous employers realize that the reward of stealing wages is greater than the risk. Far greater resources for investigation and enforcement and strengthened penalties for violations are needed to curtail wage theft. 
We conclude that the disparity in resources and penalties for shoplifting compared with wage theft has little relationship to the pervasiveness or seriousness of harm associated with the violations, and more to do with larger inequities in our society and legal system. Wage theft is an offense committed by more powerful entities (employers, including large corporations) against the less powerful (workers). Members of economically and socially vulnerable groups (including women, people of color, and immigrants, especially undocumented workers) are disproportionately likely to be victims of wage theft.2 When it comes to shoplifting, people of color, particularly African American consumers, are disproportionately likely to be profiled as potential shoplifters, even as experts assert that there is no “typical” shoplifter.3 Reforming a justice system tilted in favor of power and privilege requires efforts to eliminate retail profiling and racial bias in the criminal justice system as well as a far greater focus on the crimes of the powerful, including wage theft. 
 
Wage theft occurs when an employer pays workers less than they are legally owed for their work. It is typically a violation of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act or of state or local law. Examples of wage theft include paying less than the minimum wage, stealing employee tips, failing to pay overtime, requiring employees to work through required meal or rest breaks, forcing workers to work off-the-clock, or making illegal deductions from paychecks. In some cases, workers are never paid at all. Because wage theft is dramatically underreported, it is notoriously difficult to measure. In many cases workers may not know or understand their full rights on the job. Even when workers know they are being cheated by an employer, they may not know how to report the violation or may fear being fired or subject to some other form of retaliation if they speak up.
Yet without reporting, it is difficult to know when wage theft occurs. Recently the Economic Policy Institute released a rigorous study drawing on data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey to estimate the extent of one type of wage theft—the failure to pay workers at least the minimum wage—in the nation’s 10 most populous states.4 The study uses averages of data from 2013 through 2015. The states of California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas represent 53 percent of the nation’s workforce and can be reasonably generalized to the country as a whole. This study is our primary source of data on the prevalence of minimum wage violations.  We also look at back wages reclaimed by the Department of Labor’s wage and hour division, the nation’s primary federal enforcement body for wage theft violations.
 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Uniform Crime Reporting Handbook defines shoplifting as “the theft by a person (other than an employee) of goods or merchandise exposed for sale. By definition, the offender in a shoplifting incident has legal access to the premises and, thus, no trespass or unlawful entry is involved.”5 The FBI collects statistics on shoplifting and other crimes reported to local police departments. However, not all cases of shoplifting are reported, either because perpetrators are not apprehended or because retailers opt not to involve the police. To estimate total annual losses due to shoplifting, this report relies on United States data from the Global Retail Theft Barometer produced by research and analytics firm Smart Cube.6 This data is averaged from 2013 through 2015 to match estimate years for wage theft. We also draw on National Retail Federation’s annual National Retail Security Survey to estimate retailers’ spending on security measures in 2015.7
 
Stealing is wrong. This is a fundamental idea in our society and economy. But while taking merchandise from a store—shoplifting—is widely condemned, there is much less awareness of employers cheating workers out of the wages they are owed. This disparity is not because wage theft is less widespread. We find that just one form of wage theft, the failure to pay minimum wage, is as prevalent as shoplifting. A recent study of minimum wage violations (see “What is Wage Theft” ) finds that employers steal $15 billion annually from their employees by paying them less than the legal minimum wage and pocketing the difference.8 The study uses data averaged from 2013 through 2015. During that same period, as Figure 1 shows, the Global Retail Theft Barometer claims $14.7 billion was lost to shoplifting in the United States, including losses to both casual shoplifters and organized retail crime rings.9 In other words, cheating the lowest-paid employees in the nation out of the minimum pay they are due by law is as widespread as stealing from the shelves of a store. 
Failure to pay minimum wage is particularly prevalent in the retail sector. Retail workers lose an estimated $1.4 billion every year as a result of employers’ failure to pay minimum wage. Yet it isn’t even the most prevalent form of wage theft in retail: a study of low-wage workers in New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago found that 25.7 percent of retail and drugstore employees experienced a minimum wage violation in the past week; however, other forms of wage theft (such as failure to pay overtime, requiring employees to work off-the-clock, or mandatory work during meal breaks) were far more common.10 A survey of retail employees in New York City suggests that violations of the state’s reporting-pay law—mandating that employers pay workers for a minimum four-hour shift even if they are sent home early—are also common.11 If the full scope of wage theft was measured, it would be far greater than the amount lost to shoplifting.
 
In 2015, retailers spent an estimated $8.9 billion on security and other “loss prevention” efforts, according to data from the National Retail Federation.12 Stores frequently used surveillance cameras and burglar alarms, and many employed or contracted their own security personnel dedicated to deterring would-be shoplifters and apprehending offenders. The total does not include the public resources such as police, court systems, and jails devoted to apprehending, prosecuting and punishing suspected retail thieves. And yet, as Figure 2 illustrates, retailers’ spending on their own security is 39 times greater than the entire amount the Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division budgeted for enforcing minimum standards for wages and working conditions throughout the U.S. economy in 2015.13
 
The enormous disparity in funding corresponds to predictable differences in personnel: data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates that 43,930 security guards are employed in the retail sector, guarding, patrolling, or monitoring premises to prevent theft, violence, or infractions of rules.14 This figure does not include the other retail employees—from fitting room attendants at a clothing store to convenience store clerks—who are expected to play a role in preventing shoplifting, nor does it encompass thousands of public police officers whose responsibilities include preventing and investigating shoplifting. Meanwhile, the Department of Labor employed approximately 1,000 investigators tasked with enforcing wage laws for 7.3 million U.S. workplaces and 135 million workers.15 In some states, state labor department and attorneys-general supplemented the federal effort to enforce wage laws, but their resources were even less. As hard as Wage and Hour division staff worked—completing 27,915 compliance actions in 2015, and obtaining agreements to pay over $246 million in back wages to workers—they lacked the personnel and resources to match either the deterrent effect or the enforcement power of the security apparatus arrayed against shoplifters, as shown in Figure 3.
Shoplifters can wind up in jail, but federal penalties for wage theft are not much of a deterrent, even when millions of dollars are stolen.
If a shoplifter steals more than $2,500 in merchandise, they can face felony charges in any state in the country. In Virginia and New Jersey, theft of merchandise worth as little as $200 can bring a felony conviction and jail time. And in many states, retailers can also sue shoplifters for civil damages on top of the criminal penalties they will face. 
In contrast, federal criminal penalties are almost never applied to employers who steal wages, even if tens of thousands of dollars are systematically misappropriated from hundreds of employees for months or years.16 The civil penalties under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act are too weak to act as an effective deterrent. At most, the Department of Labor can recover only the amount by which the employer failed to pay employees the legal minimum, plus an equal amount in liquidated damages. Even for repeat or willful violations, the maximum penalty is $1,100. For first-time offenders or cases where a violation cannot be proven to be willful, the law imposes no penalty at all. 
Consider the case of furniture retailer Han Nara, which operates 7 stores in Texas, Washington State, and New Mexico under the name Ashley Furniture Home Store. The Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour division investigated the retailer 4 times over 9 years, each time finding that it had failed to pay its employees properly.17 After 2 sets of investigations and fines in 2010, the Department of Labor found in 2011 that 170 current and former employees of Han Nara had been cheated out of more than $57,000, and ordered the company to pay back wages.18Yet the repeat investigations and slap-on-the-wrist fines failed to provoke any change in the retailer’s practices, as hundreds of employees were repeatedly cheated of the minimum pay they had worked for and were owed. Han Nara didn’t stop stealing from its workers: in 2016, the company was again found to have cheated more than 500 employees out of their paychecks. From the company’s point of view, it was apparently cheaper to pay repeat penalties to the Department of Labor than to properly compensate employees. 
Weak penalties and a lack of resources for public enforcement leave working people who are victimized by wage theft with one option: going to court in an effort to recover their stolen pay. Yet increasingly, this avenue for seeking justice is also closed off for retail employees. Many major retailers, from high-end department stores Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus to fast-fashion mainstay Forever 21, now mandate that employees sign forced arbitration agreements curtailing their ability to sue the company over workplace disputes and often banning participation class action lawsuits.19 Under forced arbitration agreements, workers must agree to resolve any future legal claims against the company through a binding arbitration process. This process strongly favors employers, who are far more likely to prevail in arbitration than in state or federal court.20 There is no transparency or precedent in the process, and workers have little opportunity to appeal an unfavorable decision.21 The arbitration process can also be costly for workers, who may be required to share the cost and sometimes even cover their employer’s legal fees. This privatized system of justice, designed by and for employers, replaces the public system which retains at least the ideal of equality before the law, mirroring the privatized criminal justice system that confronts shoplifters at Walmart and many other retailers (see “Wage Theft and Shoplifting at Walmart”). 
 
Retailers emphasize that shoplifting is not a victimless crime: retail profits take a hit and higher costs are passed on to customers. Taxpayers bear the cost of law enforcement responses to shoplifting. Yet these costs pale in comparison to the consequences of wage theft, which pushes families into poverty, forces working people to rely on public benefits to make ends meet, and robs states and cities of needed tax revenue. Businesses that comply with the law may face a competitive disadvantage from rivals able to cut prices because they are cheating employees. Spread over millions of workers subjected to wage theft, the social costs are staggering.
The Economic Policy Institute estimates that 4.5 million working people across the country are victims of wage theft every year.22 Workers exposed to minimum wage violations lose an average of nearly one-quarter of their already low incomes to employer theft. As a result, many working people and their families are pushed into poverty: in the nation’s 10 most populous states, minimum wage violations throughout the economy forced 160,000 workers and their families below the poverty line. On a national basis, this would amount to more than 302,000 families driven into poverty as a result of minimum wage violations. 
In the retail industry alone, an estimated 358,000 working Americans are victimized by minimum wage violations each year. On average, they lost a sixth of their annual pay, equivalent to $2,100 stolen from their family’s income for the year.23  Yet as we’ve noted previously, violations of minimum wage laws are not the most common type of wage theft in the retail industry—workers and their families are even more likely to be affected by overtime violations, being obliged to work off-the-clock, and other workplace violations. The full impact of wage theft in retail remains incalculable. 
Workers and their families feel the greatest and most immediate effects of wage theft; when families see low incomes depressed even further, it affects workers’ health and the wellbeing of children. A growing body of research looks at the lifelong impacts of growing up in poverty on the education and life chances of children.24 At the same time, families pushed closer to poverty are compelled to rely on public benefits such as food stamps (SNAP benefits) in order to feed their families. While employers violate the law, the public must step up to feed their employees. Wage theft also takes a toll on local, state, and federal tax revenue. In a study of minimum wage violations in New York and California, the Department of Labor quantified lost tax revenue, including $283 million to $343 million in lost payroll tax revenue and $112.7 million in lost federal income tax revenue in these two states alone in 2011.25Nationwide, this would amount to as much as $2.5 billion in lost payroll and income tax revenue due to violations of minimum wage law, $429 million as a result of minimum wage violations in the retail industry alone.
Nowhere is the contrast between attitudes toward shoplifting and wage theft more apparent than at Walmart. The retail giant is the largest private employer in the United States, and it may well be among the nation’s largest perpetrators of wage theft. Walmart fights allegations of wage theft vigorously, delaying justice for years. Meanwhile, the company has faced numerous allegations of racially profiling black and Latino shoppers as suspected shoplifters.26 At many Walmart locations, accused shoplifters are pushed into privatized, for-profit programs that, according to one pending lawsuit, “intimidate and extort the accused.”27
Courts ruled that between 1998 and 2006, Walmart forced 187,979 employees in Pennsylvania to work off the clock and skip meal breaks, with the company saving more than $49 million by not paying workers what they were owed.28 The pressure to work without pay became worse during the holidays, former Walmart employee Delores Killingsworth Barber testified, when workers were required to do “whatever it takes to get done, and if that meant missing your break, [and not being paid for it] that’s what had to be done.”29 Yet Walmart’s army of attorneys fought the case all the way to the Supreme Court. It was not until the Supreme Court denied Walmart’s final appeal in 2016, after 14 years of complaints, investigations, and appeals, that the way was finally clear for Walmart workers to receive compensation that had been stolen from them a decade or more ago.  
A similar pattern emerges around the country. Whether one looks at the case of 1,800 workers employed at 3 of Walmart’s Southern California warehouses who ultimately won $21 million in unpaid wages, interest and penalties for failure to pay overtime and other wage violations, or at the 900 Walmart delivery truck drivers denied the minimum wage, it is apparent that a company with ample resources to understand and obey basic wage laws nevertheless flouts them, and fights workers’ resulting legal claims to the bitter end.30
Accused shoplifters face very different treatment. Corrective Education Company (CEC), a private firm handling security for a number of major retailers, including many Walmart locations, is under fire for “extorting suspected shoplifters into paying hundreds of dollars to participate in its six-hour-long behavioral modification program or face criminal prosecution,” according to a pending lawsuit by the San Francisco City Attorney.31 “After making false and misleading statements… designed to distort the choice facing accused shoplifters and boost the likelihood that they will… ‘choose’ to participate in the program, which forces them to sign unlawful contracts confessing to crimes. If they are unable to pay, CEC threatens to hand the case over to police for prosecution.”32 As one attorney pointed out, “There’s no judicial oversight, there are no constitutional protections, there’s no due process. It’s a private company acting as prosecutor, judge, jury, and collector.”33 Walmart and other retailers that contract with CEC and its competitors often receive a cut of the proceeds from the fines suspected shoplifters pay, creating an incentive to pressure people to enroll regardless of any evidence of guilt. As customers who may never have stolen a thing struggle to pay back fees for a privatized justice program, Walmart’s attorneys fight for years against repayment of millions of dollars in stolen wages. 
This comparison of the prevalence of shoplifting and wage theft reveals that the losses from one single type of wage theft—violations of minimum wage law—are as great as the entirety of shoplifting losses reported by the Retail Theft Barometer. Both amount to billions of dollars annually. In the case of wage theft, these losses strike at the most vulnerable working people, pushing hundreds of thousands of working Americans into poverty. Yet wage theft, an offense committed by the powerful against those with far less power, receives a fraction of the deterrence, investigatory, and enforcement resources devoted to shoplifting. Penalties are also disproportionate: shoplifting carries a criminal penalty, even a felony conviction if the value of goods stolen is substantial enough, but civil penalties for wage theft are mild, including fines that are too low to be an effective deterrent.  
In 2016, Senators Patty Murray and Sherrod Brown and Rep. Rosa DeLauro introduced the Wage Theft Prevention and Wage Recovery Act to Congress. The bill would compensate victims of wage theft with triple back pay; substantially increase civil fines, particularly for companies that are repeat offenders; allow employers to be referred for criminal prosecution in certain egregious cases; strengthen whistleblower protections; and make it easier for workers to take action to recover stolen wages. Combined with an expansion of resources for investigation and enforcement in the Department of Labor, this would help to address the epidemic of wage theft. Yet passage of this national legislation appears highly unlikely in the current political climate, and wage enforcement resources at the Department of Justice are likely to face cutbacks, not the needed expansion. Across the country a number of state and local governments have stepped up, increasing investigation and enforcement resources, engaging in public education so that workers know their rights and employers are aware of their responsibilities, and increasing penalties for wage theft. In California, another promising state-level policy enables workers to initiate wage enforcement actions on behalf of the state Attorney General or State Department of Labor. Federal, state, and local action is needed to ensure that companies in the retail sector and beyond do not feel free to rob their workforce with impunity.

"Demos’ new briefing book, Everyone’s Economy, offers an economic agenda that will enable all of us to thrive. Women’s History Month is an opportunity to dig into the ways that a race-conscious, populist economic agenda must elevate women. Over the next 2 weeks, Demos will share a series of blog posts that explore different ways that policy can impact women’s economic opportunity and stability. Today we look at how guaranteeing paid time to care benefits women.
At some point in our lives, we all need time to care for loved ones or ourselves, whether we are bonding with a new child, caring for an ailing parent, or recovering from a serious illness. Because women still take on responsibility for most caregiving, access to paid time to care both immediately increases women’s incomes and helps women who take leave retain their jobs over the longer term. Providing leave on an equal basis to fathers and male caregivers (and encouraging men to take it) also reduces discrimination against women. 
Yet in 2017, only 13 percent of private sector workers had access to paid family leave through their employer. Low-paid workers and people of color were least likely to have access to paid time to care. Without paid time away from work, Americans put their health at risk, face economic hardship, and are unable to care for those who matter most to them in a time of need.
To a great extent, the American workplace is built around the image of a male worker with a wife who is not employed outside the home and is available to provide care for children, aging relatives and loved ones who fall sick. Yet this norm never applied to most households of color or LGBTQ households, and does not apply to the majority of American households today: Currently, most families with children have all adults in the workforce, and mothers are key breadwinners. Meanwhile, the number of working people responsible for caring for elderly loved ones continues to grow as the population ages. Paid time to care is the norm in virtually every other country, yet the U.S. guarantees only unpaid time off work under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Even access to unpaid FMLA leave is unavailable to about 40 percent of working people, due to restrictions in the law.
We need a universal, public system of paid time to care, because ensuring that the next generation gets a healthy, loving start in life—and that families don’t fall into poverty as they struggle to care for one another in times of sickness—are society-wide challenges, not problems that individual families and businesses can solve on their own. The Family and Medical Insurance Leave (FAMILY) Act, currently before Congress, would establish the U.S.’s first-ever national system of paid family and medical leave. The bill would provide working people with up to 12 weeks per year of paid time to care for family and medical needs. Benefits would cover time taken for pregnancy, childbirth recovery, caring for the serious health condition of a child, parent, spouse, or domestic partner, birth or adoption of a child, and military caregiving. Workers taking leave would receive two-thirds of their typical monthly wages, up to a capped monthly maximum. Low- and middle-income workers have a greater share of their income replaced. Significantly, all working people, including part-time, contingent, and self-employed workers and people working for small employers would be eligible for benefits.
A more comprehensive proposal could include longer duration of time to care (for example, Canada offers 12 months of leave benefits to new parents, which can be extended to 18 months at a lower rate of pay); a greater share of pay replaced for the lowest-paid workers; leave that protects the jobs of workers at small businesses; and benefits that cover a greater range of loved ones, such as siblings or “chosen family”—a person, designated in advance, who shares a close relationship.

"Earlier this week, I made the case that the massive data breach at Equifax highlights the need for better regulation and oversight of the credit reporting industry. Today, Senator Elizabeth Warren reintroduced legislation that fills a key part of the regulatory gap: her Equal Employment for All Act will ban the use of personal credit information for employment decisions.
By eliminating employment credit checks, the bill would remove an unfair and discriminatory barrier to economic mobility and security.
Today in the United States, qualified job seekers are turned away from employment because of their personal credit history. Employment credit checks are used by nearly half of all employers as part of the hiring process for numerous jobs, from positions in the retail industry to work as a chef, storage facility manager, graphic designer, nursing assistant, personal trainer, office assistant, or carpenter (just to take a quick look through recent job postings on Craigslist).
In other words, if a consumer’s identity is stolen as a result of the Equifax data breach, victims could find that not only does ruined credit harm their ability to get a loan or qualify for insurance—they could also be denied a job. This is an excellent reason to follow the identity theft protection advice offered by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. But it’s also an opportunity to question why an employment credit check is considered valid under any circumstances.
Job seekers whose credit is damaged as a result of medical debt, student loans, a layoff, divorce, predatory lending, or simple error can be shut out of jobs—despite a lack of evidence connecting personal credit history with job performance. The practice has a disparate impact on people of color, who are more likely to have poor credit as a result of predatory lending that continues to target communities of color, as well as the enduring impact of racial discrimination in employment, lending, education, and housing. People with disabilities and survivors of domestic abuse also face discrimination as a result of employment credit checks.
My research finds that poor credit is linked to economic stress: weak credit is correlated with unemployment, lack of health coverage, and the presence of children in a household. By screening out job applicants who have flawed credit, employers are effectively judging a prospective employee on the basis of economic disadvantage, and effectively multiplying that disadvantage. 
Employers conduct credit checks because Equifax and other credit reporting firms have aggressively marketed their product as a way to discern a prospective employee’s character or even whether they are likely to commit fraud or steal from an employer. As I noted above, there is scant evidence that personal credit history can reveal any of this. But credit reporting companies aren’t letting the facts get in the way of a lucrative business opportunity. Without regulation like Senator Warren’s Equal Employment for All Act, Equifax and other credit reporting companies will be able to continue cashing in on an ineffective, discriminatory product, and Americans will keep getting shut out of jobs. ",blog
"Today's economy doesn't contain a lot of good news for working people. While the Great Recession officially ended five years ago, millions of Americans are still out of work and wages continue to lag. Yet this week, working people made some hugely significant gains as the fruits sowed by organizing efforts, lawsuits, legislative action -- and above all, workers standing up for themselves despite tremendous risk -- began to be visible.
The week's most important victory came in a Tuesday ruling by the National Labor Relations Board, which found that McDonald's is a ""joint employer"" of workers at its franchised restaurants. The NLRB rightly ruled that company so closely controls and oversees its franchisees that the McDonald's corporation, together with the franchisees, can now be held accountable for practices that violate employees' rights. Former NLRB chairwoman Wilma Liebman was quoted in the New York Timesexplaining that the decision could give fast food workers leverage to organize unions and raise wages at McDonald's restaurants nationwide.
The upshot? Fast food workers are a big step closer to winning $15 and a union they have repeatedly gone on strike to attain. And they are energized to win the fight: At their first-ever national convention last weekend, fast food workers vowed to intensify their efforts through non-violent civil disobedience. After all, it's clear that fast food giants like McDonald's can well afford to pay workers more. In fact, research by my Demos colleague Catherine Ruetschlin shows that poverty wages and sky-high pay packages for executives at McDonalds and other fast food corporations have combined to destabilize the companies to such an extent that investors should be concerned.",media
"Unions were instrumental in creating the American middle class, and today they continue to empower millions of Americans to bargain for wages and benefits that are capable of sustaining a middle-class standard of living. Among workers in similar jobs, unionized employees are significantly more likely to earn middle-class wages;1 and have sick, family, and vacation leave policies, health care, and retirement plans.2 Unions also improve wages and job quality even for those who are not members: in areas and industries with a high degree of union representation, unions can exert upward pressure on industry standards across-the-board.3
In surveys, 53 percent of non-managerial, non-union workers say they would likely vote for a union in their workplace.4 Yet only 11.9 percent of the nation’s wage and salary workers were union members in 2010, and just 6.9 percent of private sector employees belonged to unions.5 While a number of factors, including shifts in employment away from the traditionally unionized manufacturing sector, contributed to the decline in union membership, one significant element is employer obstruction of workplace rights. 
Enacted in 1935, the National Labor Relations Act was aimed at encouraging the formation of unions and promoting collective bargaining. According to the NLRA, employees did not previously “possess full freedom of association or actual liberty of contract” because individual workers were at a disadvantage when attempting to negotiate working conditions with an employer that could organize as a corporation.6 This imbalance of power in the workplace would push down wages and reduce workers’ purchasing power, making recessions worse. To remedy the imbalance, the National Labor Relations Act gave employees the right to organize unions and bargain collectively.
Today, the system meant to defend the rights of employees to form unions no longer functions. Weak and slow-moving enforcement of labor rights allows employers to routinely violate the law, threatening and harassing employees who attempt to organize. Illegal threats, bribes, and even the firing of union organizers are commonplace.7 Employees who dare to stand up for their right to join a union can face years of unemployment when they are illegally fired, while employers face virtually no penalty for denying their employees’ basic legal rights. By strengthening penalties and replacing the easily abused mechanism of National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) elections with a streamlined employee sign-up procedure, this policy, based on the Employee Free Choice Act considered by Congress in 2007, would restore Americans’ ability to choose union representation. In every workplace where a majority of employees want union representation, they could join easily, and begin to negotiate the pay and benefits that would enable them to enter the middle class.

"EMPLOYEES IN NYC CAN USE SICK LEAVE STARTING JULY 30. That’s the simple message New York’s Department of Consumer Affairs was spreading on street corners and subway stops this morning in English, Spanish, Chinese, Russian and four other languages common to the city. “NYC’s new paid sick leave law applies to most employees!” continued the English page of the flyer, explaining the basic outlines of the new city law that guarantees people working in New York City the right to earn a few paid sick days a year.
New York City’s paid sick days law, passed in watered-down form over Mayor Bloomberg’s veto in 2013 and expanded quickly under the leadership of Mayor de Blasio and Council Speaker Melissa Mark Viverito, will enable the more than 1 million working New Yorkers who previously had no access to paid sick time to earn up to 40 hours (five days) of sick leave a year to care for themselves or family members.
At least, it will do that if employees know they have the right to sick leave and feel empowered to take it.
When the Center for Law and Social Policy scrutinized the implementation of paid sick days laws in San Francisco, Connecticut, Washington DC and Seattle, they found that employees’ lack of awareness about their new right to paid sick leave can be a major barrier to compliance and enforcement. “Workers absolutely have these rights,” an advocate in the District of Columbia told the Washington Post in 2010. ""but if you don't know about it, there's nothing you can do.""
That’s why public education and outreach have been a major component of the New York law, which requires employers to pass out a Notice of Employee Rights to all new and continuing workers in English and their primary language (if it is not English) and included public education events, partnerships, and advertisements in English and Spanish on 1,000 subway cars and 1,000 buses, as well as on bus shelters and phone kiosks.
And that’s why I volunteered with the city’s Department of Consumer Affairs this morning to hand out flyers on the law at a busy subway station on the 2/3 line in Harlem.
Many passersby and commuters were keenly interested. “I heard about this!” a woman exclaimed, taking the flyer. “I wondered when it was starting.”
“This is a good law! People need to know about this law,” said the fruit vendor on the corner, taking copies of the flyer for his co-workers.
But then a man asked: “Will this help me get a job? I need a job before I can worry about taking sick days.” And there’s the rub: while studies have consistently shown that paid sick leave guarantees do not harm job growth, neither is the policy designed to generate the new employment New Yorkers (and Americans more broadly) need. Having a few days off a year to provide care when a child gets sick will help countless New York parents hold onto their jobs, but it’s not going to create full employment.
One law, as hard-fought as it was, can’t do everything. But it’s an important step towards a more fair and healthy city—and a law we still need to pass at the federal level. And in addition to the concrete benefits, the right to paid sick days can help to build an expectation of basic fairness and dignity on the job, giving us momentum to fight for further rights.

"“Silly.”
That’s how Walmart spokesperson Kory Lundberg described the concerns of Walmart workers and their allies who protested the mega-retailers low wages and poor employment policies in New York City last Thursday. “Wal-Mart doesn’t have any locations in New York City,” explained Lundberg, trying to reach those of us still too silly to grasp the fact.
But the protestors (Demos colleagues and I were proudly among them) were making some considerably less silly points. As the nation’s largest private employer, Walmart’s business practices—from its treatment of its own employees, to the pressure it exerts on suppliers and competitors to treat their workforce similarly—has profoundly influenced the entire American economy, particularly in the manufacturing, warehousing,  and retail sectors. The economic changes Walmart helped promote, from abusive scheduling practices to low wages to a basic disrespect for the frontline workforce, have impacted workers throughout the country—including in New York City, which has no Walmart stores, despite Walmart’s repeated efforts to expand into the city’s dense and lucrative market.  
But New York is also important for another reason. Although the city contains no Walmart stores, it does have Walmart money, including wealth stemming from the billions of dollars in dividends that heirs to founder Sam Walton receive each year in continuing income from the operations of the company. Consider, for example the $25 million invested in a lovely piece of Manhattan real estate by billionaire Walmart heiress, Alice Walton. It was to her imposing Park Avenue building that protestors, including Walmart workers who traveled from other cities and states, tried to deliver a petition calling on the company to publicly commit to raise worker pay to $15 an hour and provide consistent, full-time work. Alas, Ms. Walton was not at home. 26 protestors were arrested for acts of civil disobedience.
But someone at Walmart may have been listening to workers’ “silly” concerns—or trying to preempt them. A day before workers marched, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told reporters, “it is our intention over time that we will be in a situation where we don't pay minimum wage at all.” In other words, Walmart would consider nudging up pay for the approximately 6,000 workers to whom it currently pays the federal minimum wage of $7.25. The decision to “invest in its associate base” as McMillon described it, is a sound one, as Walmart’s focus on short-term results at the expense of front-line service is hurting the company.
But Walmart can—and should—do so much more. As my colleague Catherine Ruetschlin and I explained in a brief earlier this year, Walmart would benefit from reallocating resources away from short-term earning s and toward its human capital (the “associate base,” also known as its workforce) raising productivity by reducing turnover and improving employee engagement, enhancing customer service, and building long-term value. We find that if Walmart redirected the $6.6 billion it spends annually on share repurchases, it could give its 825,000 low-wage employees a raise of $5.13 per hour, boosting the company’s productivity and sales.
And just as Walmart’s poor labor practices have dragged down the quality of retail jobs nationwide, a boost like this could lift them up—my other recent research focused on the wages of women at all the nation’s large retailers and found that establishing a new wage floor equivalent to $25,000 per year for full-time, year-round work would improve the lives of more than 3.2 million female retail workers and lift 900,000 women and their families directly out of poverty or near poverty. A wage turnaround at Walmart could be the spark that makes that happen.
Unfortunately, an indefinite hope to “over time” raise pay for a small number of employees pales in comparison to other recent Walmart announcements, such as the not-at-all vague declaration that the company would be terminating health coverage for 30,000 part-time associates. Nor does inching compensation up to $7.35 an hour look much like the $15 and a full-time schedule workers are demanding. But from the Walmart corporate office to make the announcement demonstrates the power of Walmart workers' collective voice.
The call for $15 and a full-time schedule is only going to get louder as the all-important Christmas shopping season approaches.",blog
"It’s not a bad time to be looking for work in America. The job numbers released this morning show an overall unemployment rate of just 3.9 percent in July. For white men over the age of 20, the rate of joblessness is even lower: 2.9 percent. But the picture is entirely different for black job seekers, who face an unemployment rate more than twice as high. In July, 6.6 percent of African Americans in the workforce were unable to land a job. 
The enormous disparity between black and white unemployment rates is unlikely to make headlines for one simple reason – there’s nothing new about it. For decades, black unemployment has remained roughly twice the rate of unemployment for white workers, regardless of a job seeker’s level of education. Social exclusion shows us why.
Social exclusion is “a set of decisions and actions [by the] economically and politically powerful.” Social exclusion includes deliberately deploying white supremacist and racist ideas to justify and naturalize the economic and political disadvantages faced by people of color. In the labor market, social exclusion drives the notion that workers of color are less deserving of employment.
This deeply racist idea propels broad policy decisions and individual actions that strip workers of color of equal opportunity in the labor market. Middle managers and human resources directors enforce and perpetuate social exclusion in the labor market even though they did not originate these discriminatory ideas and may not be aware that they are propagating them. For example, companies adopt ostensibly race-neutral screening policies that disproportionately filter out job applicants of color (more on these below). At the same time, employers absorb implicit (and sometimes explicit) biases that result in discriminatory hiring decisions.
Inequality in American labor markets was maintained by law for much of U.S. history. Before the Civil Rights Act of 1964, employers in many states were legally allowed—and in some contexts, required—to discriminate on the basis of race and color (as well as sex, religion, and national origin). Today federal law forbids these types of discrimination, yet evidence of persistent discrimination remains widespread. A meta-analysis of recent research finds that employers still give white job applicants 36 percent more callbacks for a job interview than equally qualified black applicants, and 24 percent more than equally qualified Latino applicants. The analysis includes a study finding that resumes with white-sounding names are more likely to be asked for an interview than identical resumes with black-sounding names, an effect that does not differ across occupations and industries. Discrimination persists even among employers that claim to value diversity.
Other forms of social exclusion intersect with and reinforce employment exclusion. After gains from civil rights-era policies, today’s state and local policymakers are re-segregating American education and providing inadequate funding to schools that serve students of color, creating stronger headwinds for young people of color looking for good jobs than for their white counterparts. Policymakers’ racially-biased criminal justice policies, including the over-policing and mass incarceration of communities of color, mean that black and brown job seekers are disproportionately affected when employers refuse to consider job applicants with an arrest or conviction record. And because banks and other lenders have long targeted black communities for predatory financial products and other forms of racial discrimination, African Americans tend to have lower credit ratings than whites, so employers who use credit checks in hiring disproportionately block African-American applicants from job opportunities. Superficially race-neutral hiring policies thus reinforce social exclusion in the labor market.  
Social exclusion is visible not only in rates of unemployment, but also under-employment—situations where workers want full-time employment but instead work part-time because of slack business conditions or because they were only offered part-time jobs. At Walmart and other large employers, part-time workers are speaking out about concerns that managers’ favoritism results in racially-discriminatory decisions about which employees have an opportunity to work full-time hours. While workers have not succeeded in getting Walmart to release demographic information about its part-time workforce, federal statistics support the perception that employers as a whole are more likely to deny full-time work to black and Latino employees: In 2017, 21.7 percent of black workers who were employed part-time would have preferred full-time work and 22.7 percent of Latino workers employed part-time would have preferred a full-time job, compared to 13.9 percent of white part-time employees. Involuntary part-time work is especially problematic because employers often offer part-time workers fewer benefits and less pay for the same work as full-time employees. In addition, it is frequently more difficult for part-time workers to advance within the company.
A history of social exclusion in the labor market lays the foundation for continued social exclusion. Because workers of color experience higher rates of unemployment than white workers, they must more often take on debt or tap into any assets they have accumulated to make up for lost income when they are between jobs—draining their already limited wealth to a greater extent than white households. Employers’ social exclusion that keeps black and Latino workers out of a job thus also contributes to the racial wealth gap, undermining the overall economic security of black and Latino households. And, since wealth is passed down across generations and can promote upward social mobility (for example, by paying for a child’s higher education or investing in a new business venture), the increased drain on wealth due to higher unemployment limits mobility across generations. The same decisions and actions that deny workers of color of equal opportunity in the labor market today also pave the way for economic deprivation across generations.
In addition to unemployment, social exclusion in labor markets impacts the quality of jobs available to people of color. I’ll explore this further in my next post.",blog
"How past racial injustices are carried forward as wealth handed down across generations and reinforced by “color-blind” practices and policies
Issues of racial inequity are increasingly at the forefront of America’s public debate. In addition to urgent concerns about racial bias in law enforcement and the criminal justice system, activists highlight deeply connected issues of economic exclusion and inequality. No metric more powerfully captures the persistence and growth of economic inequality along racial and ethnic lines than the racial wealth gap. According to data from the Survey of Consumer Finances, the median white household possessed $13 in net wealth for every dollar held by the median black household in 2013. That same year, median white households possessed $10 for each dollar held by the median Latino/a household.
Research probing the causes of the racial wealth gap has traced its origins to historic injustices, from slavery to segregation to redlining.1 The great expansion of wealth in the years after World War II was fueled by public policies such as the GI Bill, which mostly helped white veterans attend college and purchase homes with guaranteed mortgages, building the foundations of an American middle class that largely excluded people of color. The outcomes of past injustice are carried forward as wealth is handed down across generations and are reinforced by ostensibly “color-blind” practices and policies in effect today. Yet many popular explanations for racial economic inequality overlook these deep roots, asserting that wealth disparities must be solely the result of individual life choices and personal achievements. The misconception that personal responsibility accounts for the racial wealth gap is an obstacle to the policies that could effectively address racial disparities.
This paper explores a number of these popular explanations for the racial wealth gap, looking at individual differences in education, family structure, full- or part-time employment, and consumption habits. In each case, we find that individual choices are not sufficient to erase a century of accumulated wealth: structural racism trumps personal responsibility. Drawing on data from the 2013 Survey of Consumer Finances, we find that white adults who don’t graduate high school, don’t get married before having children, and don’t work full time still have much greater wealth at the median than comparable black and Latino adults—and often have more wealth than black and Latino households that have married, completed more education, or work longer hours. Differences in consumption habits also cannot explain the wealth gap; we look at academic research finding that white households spend more than black households of comparable incomes, yet still have more wealth.
The racial wealth gap matters because of the central role wealth plays in enabling families to both handle current financial challenges and make investments in their future. Families that have accumulated some wealth are better equipped to manage unanticipated expenses like an emergency medical bill, or disruptions in household income such as a layoff, without falling into debt or poverty. Over the longer term, wealth can expand the prospects of the next generation, helping to pay for college, provide a down payment for a first home, or capitalize a new business. As long as a substantial racial wealth gap persists, white households will continue to enjoy greater advantages than their black and Latino neighbors in meeting the financial challenges of everyday life and will be able to make greater investments in their children, passing economic advantages on. We can only create a more equitable future by confronting the racial wealth gap and the public policies that continue to fuel and exacerbate it. 
This report analyzes data on white, black, and Latino households. The terms black and white are used to refer to the representative respondents of a household who identified as non-Latino black or white in the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF).2 Latinos include everyone who identified as Hispanic or Latino and may be of any race.
Throughout this report, we use the term “racial wealth gap” to refer to the absolute differences in wealth (assets minus debt) between the median black and white households as well as between the median Latino and white households. All dollar figures are in 2013 dollars. 
The median white adult who attended college has 7.2 times more wealth than the median black adult who attended college and 3.9 times more wealth than the median Latino adult who attended college.
Higher education is associated with greater household wealth for Americans of every race and ethnicity, yet going to college isn’t enough to overcome racial disparities in wealth.3 Among households under age 55, the median white high school dropout has similar wealth to the median black adult who graduated high school and attended at least some college, according to data from the Survey of Consumer Finances.4 Similarly, the median Latino adult who attended college has similar wealth to the median white high school dropout. 
As Figure 1 shows, black adults with at least some college—a group that includes any amount of college education, from students who attended college but attained no degree, to those with associate’s or bachelor’s degrees—had $11,100 in wealth at the median, while Latino adults with at least some college had $20,500 in wealth at the median. These figures are dwarfed by the $79,600 in median wealth held by whites who attended at least some college.
In effect, to gain wealth comparable to white high school dropouts, black and Latino students must not only complete high school, but also attend college.5 Higher education is valuable—but when it comes to wealth, white privilege is equally, if not more valuable.
Attending college is associated with wealth in a number of ways. A college education has long been heralded as a ladder of social mobility: graduates who earn a bachelor’s degree or other college certification are more likely to be employed and generally have higher earning power than high school graduates or dropouts; they can use their higher incomes to build savings and wealth.
Indeed, research consistently finds that college graduates of every race and ethnicity have greater income and wealth than their counterparts who did not graduate college.6 Yet wealth also plays a role in determining who attends college in the first place, and how much debt students must take on to get a degree.7 In effect, education can generate a “wealth feedback loop,” as parents’ level of education and wealth significantly predicts the level of education their children will complete.8 Thus, the educational and wealth-building opportunities directly denied to people of color in past generations continue to reverberate in the lives of their children, even those whose educational achievements open up opportunities for well-paid employment opportunities.
Having left high school without a diploma and never pursued further education, white dropouts do not gain the wealth-building opportunities offered by a college education. Yet, advantages such as greater access to gifts and inheritances offer white households more opportunities to gain and build wealth, even when they have completed less education. Because white families accumulated more wealth over a history in which black and Latino families were excluded from many wealth-building opportunities through discriminatory policies in housing, banking, education and other areas, white families today have, in general, greater resources to pass on to their offspring. As a result, white families are 5 times more likely than black or Latino families to receive large gifts and inheritances, and the amounts they receive are far greater.9 An analysis of data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics finds that white recipients collect $5,013 more than black families on average over a two-year period.10 Not only do these funds add up to a substantial amount over time, but they can also be used to jump-start further wealth accumulation, for example, by enabling white families to buy homes and begin acquiring equity earlier in their lives and to make larger down payments on a first home, reducing interest rates and lending costs.11
For black and Latino households with at least some college education, the high cost of college is another reason why pursuing higher education—and even attaining a degree—is not more effective at reducing the racial wealth gap. Our earlier research finds that even if black and Latino students graduated college at the same rate as white students, the reduction in the racial wealth gap would be modest: cut by just 1 to 3 percent at the median.12 Because of the existing racial wealth gap, white college students disproportionately come from wealthier family backgrounds than black and Latino students. As a result, the research finds that black students borrow at much higher rates, and in higher amounts, to receive the same college degrees as their white counterparts.13 The higher rate of borrowing may in turn contribute to other disparities, including college dropout and completion rates. With less student loan debt to pay off over their working years, the typical white college graduate has a head start on building wealth compared to their black peers. The picture is different for Latino households, which attend and graduate from college at lower rates than both black and white households. Evidence suggests that Latino students may be more averse to taking on student loans even when they face substantial financial need for school.14
The result is that whites with little formal education still benefit disproportionately from social networks that help them to attain jobs, and inheritances and gifts that help them to build wealth. Black and Latino households that have pursued higher education often lack access to these networks and resources, but black college- goers in particular carry a disproportionate burden of student loan debt that saps their resources and diminishes their ability to build wealth. While attending and graduating college is associated with greater wealth for all American households and is a boost to lifetime earnings and wealth, it’s not enough to overcome historic and accumulated white advantages in building wealth. An individual’s striving to get a degree is not sufficient to close the racial wealth gap.  
The median white single parent has 2.2 times more wealth than the median black two-parent household and 1.9 times more wealth than the median Latino two-parent household.
Raising children is expensive. The high cost of child care and difficulty of supporting a family on a single income make it particularly difficult for single parents to get by, much less build wealth. Not surprisingly, single parent households have much higher poverty rates and significantly lower wealth than two-parent households. Yet, raising children in a two-parent household isn’t enough to overcome racial disparities in wealth. According to data from the Survey of Consumer Finances, the median white single parent has 2.2 times more wealth than the median black two-parent household and 1.9 times more wealth than the median Latino two-parent household. 
As Figure 2 shows, black couples with children had $16,000 in wealth at the median, while Latino couples with children had $18,800 in wealth at the median. For each group, this is significantly more than the wealth of single-parent households. Yet it is a fraction of the $161,300 in median wealth held by white couples with children—and is still significantly less than the $35,800 in median wealth held by white single parents. Despite the financial benefits of marriage and partnership, including the opportunity to share expenses, provide child care within the family, or have two adult earners, the median white single parent is $19,800 wealthier than the median black couple with children, and $17,000 wealthier than the median Latino couple with children. It’s clear that raising children with two parents is not enough to overcome the racial wealth gap—or even to pull families out of poverty. In 2014, black children with married parents were 3 times more likely to be living in poverty than white children with married parents, while Latino children with married parents were 4 times more likely to be living in poverty than their white counterparts.15
In 1965, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan’s report, The Negro Family: The Case for National Action, attributed racial inequality as well as poverty and crime in the black community to family structure, particularly the prevalence of families headed by single mothers.16 Not only did research at the time cast doubt on this causality, but evidence over the last the 50 years demonstrates that rates of child poverty, educational attainment, and crime do not track rates of single parenthood.17 Thus, even though the share of children living with a single mother rose for all racial and ethnic groups through the mid-1990s and has remained high since then, school completion and youth arrests for violent crimes have declined significantly, while poverty rates have fluctuated according to economic conditions. Family structure does not drive racial inequity, and racial inequity persists regardless of family structure. The benefits of intergenerational wealth transfers and other aspects of white privilege discussed above benefit white single mothers, enabling them to build significantly more wealth than married parents of color. 
The median white household that includes a full-time worker has 7.6 times more wealth than the median black household with a full-time worker. The median white household that includes a full-time worker also has 5.4 times more wealth than the median Latino household with a full-time worker.
Full-time work is critical to the economic security of most American households. Full-time jobs generally pay more per hour than comparable part-time work and are more likely to offer benefits such as employer-provided health coverage, paid sick time, and workplace retirement plans that can provide greater opportunities for employees to build wealth. At the median, households in which at least 1 member works full time (35 or more hours per week) have greater wealth than households where the only jobs held are part-time positions (less than 35 hours per week). But working full time isn’t enough to close the racial wealth gap. According to data from the Survey of Consumer Finances, the median white household that includes a full-time worker has 7.6 times more wealth than the median black household with a full-time worker. The median white household that includes a full-time worker also has 5.4 times more wealth than the median Latino household with a full-time worker. Even white households that include only part-time workers—with at least 1 person in the household employed but not working more than 35 hours a week—have statistically indistinguishable levels of wealth as black households with a member employed full-time.18
As Figure 3 shows, black households with at least 1 worker employed full time had $10,800 in wealth at the median, while Latino households with at least 1 worker employed full time had $15,300 in wealth at the median. For both groups, this is significantly more than the wealth of households where workers held only part-time jobs. Yet it is nowhere near the $82,400 in median wealth held by white households with a full-time worker. Working full time is far from enough for households of color to catch up to white wealth. Despite all the wealth-building benefits of full-time employment, median black and Latino households with full-time workers had essentially the same level of wealth as the median white household with only part-time employment. 
Americans of all races and ethnicities work hard: among working white, black, and Latino households with a head under age 55, all work at least 40 hours a week at the median and 80 percent or more have an adult employed full-time.19 Yet work effort does not pay off equally: in 2012, white workers employed full time earned a median wage of $792 a week, compared to $621 for African Americans and $568 for Latinos. Considering gender makes the pay disparities even more glaring: Latina women employed full time earned median weekly wages equal to just 59 percent of the wages earned by white males, while black women earned just 68 percent as much.20 However, even if households earned the same income, the racial wealth gap would persist. Previous research from Demos and Institute on Assets and Social Policy at Brandeis University finds that if the distribution of incomes for black and Latino Americans was similar to that of white households (with a median equal to $50,400 in 2011), the wealth gap between black and white households would shrink just 11 percent at the median and the wealth gap between Latino and white households would shrink just 9 percent. An individual’s striving to get a higher paid job or work more hours is not enough to close the racial wealth gap. 
The average white household spends 1.3 times more than the average black household of the same income group.
Personal finance experts abound with advice on how to build wealth by moderating personal spending and shifting a greater share of income into savings and investment. Yet, evidence from a recent Duke University study suggests that reduced spending is not enough to close the racial wealth gap between black and white households. Drawing on data from the 2013 and 2014 Consumer Expenditure Surveys, researchers find that the average white household spends 1.3 times more than the average black household of the same income group.21 In general, little research has been published on racial and ethnic differences in spending patterns and no findings were available on consumer spending among Latino households. 
The Duke study divided households into low-, medium-, and high-income groups and found that white households in every income group spent more on average than black households in the same group. On average, white households spent $13,700 per quarter, compared to $8,400 for black households. Even after accounting for factors such as family structure, income, occupation, and geography, as well as wealth and homeownership, white households at all income levels continued to spend more than comparable black households, with low-income white households spending $1,200 more per quarter than low-income black households and high-income white households spending $1,400 more than their black counterparts.
The study also looked at specific categories of spending, finding that white households spend about twice as much as black households on entertainment among all income groups and that white households, especially those with low incomes, spend more than black households on cars. The researchers note that “for clothing, jewelry, personal care, entertainment, eating out, and other non- essential spending, our findings show that black consumers in fact spend the same or much less than whites, at all income levels.”22 The only category in which black households were found to consistently spend more was for utilities, including payments for electricity, heating fuel, water, sewer and telephone service; this may be due to the common utility company practice of risk-based pricing, which requires a deposit or other form of additional payment from customers with low credit scores, without stable employment, or with criminal records. While technically color-blind, risk-based pricing can have a disproportionate impact on black consumers, causing them to be charged more than white households for the same service.23
Differences in spending habits cannot explain the racial wealth gap: white households spend more than black households with similar incomes, yet also have more wealth. While spending less and saving more may be excellent advice for individuals, the evidence suggests that personal spending habits are not driving the racial wealth gap and cannot succeed in closing it. 
In order for our nation to begin addressing disparities in wealth and opportunity, we must recognize that the racial wealth gap exists and clearly understand its causes. Public polling data suggest that there remains much work to be done. When asked in a 2016 opinion survey to assess “the financial situation of blacks compared with whites today,” just half of Americans (including 47 percent of white respondents, 58 percent of black respondents, and 49 percent of Latino respondents) recognized that white households were better off financially.24 No comparable question was asked comparing the finances of Latino and white households. Similarly when the same survey asked about “reasons why black people in our country may have a harder time getting ahead than whites,” majorities of black, white and Latino Americans endorsed explanations such as “lack of motivation to work hard” and “family instability”—factors which the data reveal cannot account for the growth and persistence of the racial wealth gap. Although 77 percent of respondents also identified “racial discrimination” as a reason that black Americans might have a harder time economically, 66 percent asserted that “discrimination that is based on the prejudice of individual people” was a greater problem than “discrimination that is built into our laws and institutions.” 
Racial inequality in wealth is rooted in historic discrimination and perpetuated by policy: our analyses show that individual behavior is not the driving force behind racial wealth disparities. Typical black and Latino households that attend college and live in two-parent households still have much less wealth than similarly situated white households. Black and Latino households that include a full-time worker have much less wealth than white households with a full-time worker, and only slightly more wealth at the median than white households where the only person employed works part time. Differences in spending habits also fail to explain wealth disparities between black and white households.
Building a more equitable society will require a shift in focus away from individual behavior towards addressing structural and institutional racism. To aid in that effort, the Institute on Assets and Social Policy developed the Racial Wealth AuditTM as a framework to evaluate public policy proposals for their potential to reduce the racial wealth gap. When policymakers explicitly consider the racial wealth gap in developing policy, the Racial Wealth Audit can provide information to achieve greater racial wealth equity. 
In this report, we present key descriptive statistics of household wealth for specific subgroups of interest. Data derive from the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) from 2013, the most recent available year for the data, which is among the best national sources of data on household wealth in the United States.
We calculated medians and their confidence intervals for wealth of white, black, and Hispanic [the term used by SCF] households by education, family structure and full-time employment. For the analysis of households by educational level and full-time employment status, only households who reported any positive work hours and whose head was less than 55 years of age were included in the analysis to focus on working households in their prime workforce years.
Because of the highly skewed nature of wealth, the median is
the preferred statistic, as it is not affected by extremely high values. Confidence intervals indicate the range in which we are 95 percent confident the true median value in the population lies. Overlapping confidence intervals between 2 groups indicate that the values for the groups cannot be statistically distinguished; conversely, if the confidence intervals for 2 groups do not overlap, we have sufficient statistical evidence to indicate that the values of the 2 medians are distinct in the true population.
Analysis by race/ethnicity is shaped by the available data in the SCF on the U.S. resident population. Whites are defined for this analysis as non-Hispanic whites. Hispanics may be of any race. There are insufficient data in the SCF to produce this analysis for Native Americans and Asians. 
Education: Median wealth is compared among race/ethnicity subgroups for households whose heads have not completed high school and those whose heads have completed some college or hold an undergraduate degree. Those households with no work hours, with heads greater than 54 years old, and with heads with more than 16 years of education (i.e. those who started or completed graduate school) have been excluded from the analysis.
Since this report focuses on median wealth, 95 percent confidence intervals for all median point estimates are provided. Confidence intervals are calculated using a dataset which averages the data from the 5 implicates that are provided in the SCF data for every survey household in the survey due to multiple imputation (see SCF website for further information on the survey design of the SCF). Median point estimates vary slightly when the dataset is averaged across implicates; however, these confidence intervals provide a conservative estimate of the confidence intervals while adjusting for the structure of the publicly available data.
Family Structure of Parents: Median wealth is compared for parent households—who have children of the head or spouse of any age living
in the household—by marital status of the household head among white, black, and Latino households. Households who are married or living with a partner are included in the married sample. 
Full-Time and Part-Time Work of Households: Lastly, median wealth is examined by race/ethnicity for working households categorized by whether a household has an adult employed full time or if the household has only workers employed part time. Households that have at least 1 full-time working adult (at least 35 hours per week) are selected into the group of households working full time, while those with positive work hours but no individual working at least 35 hours per week are included in the group of part-time working households. Households with no work hours and those with heads greater than 54 years old have been excluded from the analysis to focus on working households in their prime years and avoid the inclusion of part-time workers transitioning into retirement. ",research
"Comments to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
Regarding
Defining Larger Participants in Certain Markets for Consumer Financial Products and Services Markets [Docket N. CFPB-HQ-2011-2]
From Demos
Demos welcomes the opportunity to respond to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Notice and Request for Comment concerning the Bureau's definition of larger non-bank participants in markets for consumer financial products and services. 
Because the financial services landscape changes quickly and risks to consumers are constantly shifting, we urge the CFPB to adopt a flexible, broad standard that can respond to changes in the marketplace and ensure that risky actors do not evade supervision.
Consumers benefit from the fact that The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Pub.L. 111-203) offers a flexible framework for the CFPB to define its supervisory authority, enabling the Bureau to evaluate which non-banks present potential risks to consumers in a range of ways. Adopting a flexible, broad definition of a ""larger participant"" will allow the Bureau to effectively carry out its mandate under the statute and respond quickly to marketplace shifts that produce new risks to consumers. A broad definition will also promote even-handed regulation, creating a level-playing field in the financial marketplace as all non-bank competitors become aware that they could potentially face the Bureau's supervision. Once the Bureau defines a broad scope for supervision, it should exercise its authority judiciously, assessing risk when determining which entities to actually supervise and how frequently.
Demos' recent research has focused on the consumer reporting industry, and we strongly agree that the CFPB should include consumer reporting in the initial rule. Indeed, consumer reporting can be seen as an exemplar of the rapidly changing consumer marketplace: credit reports and scores that were initially developed to evaluate the risks of lending to a particular consumer have been adapted for use in a wide range of other consumer contexts in which their predictive value is dubious or unclear. Landlords, insurance companies, public utilities, and even employers now use credit reports for decision-making with significant impacts on consumers' economic well-being. At the same time nationwide specialty credit reporting companies are promoting a variety of consumer records, including information of dubious relevance such as gym membership and magazine subscription data, for lending and non-lending financial purposes with substantial potential impacts on consumers.
The consumer reporting industry is particularly in need of CFPB supervision due to its failure to meet basic standards of fairness and accuracy articulated in the Fair Credit Reporting Act, putting American consumers at risk. Reports and scores exclude relevant information, include inaccurate information, and contain data about medical debt collections that reveal more about an individual's private health concerns than their overall credit worthiness. Credit reports largely mirror racial and economic divides, with African Americans and Latinos disproportionately likely to have lower scores. In turn, consumers in these communities are more likely to be offered high-priced loan products, which may contribute to more defaults, maintaining and amplifying historical injustice. Finally, credit reports are composed exclusively of information about individual consumers, but consumers lack unrestricted access to relevant credit information and must often pay fees to obtain their own credit scores. As the CFPB's own initial research has concluded, differences between consumer- and creditor-purchased credit scores can lead to potential consumer harm.
With reference to the consumer reporting industry and other non-bank providers of financial products and services, we recommend that the Bureau adopt the following criteria for determining which non-banks should be defined as ""larger participants"":
The three nationwide consumer reporting agencies, Transunion, Experian, and Equifax should unquestionably be considered ""larger participants"" in the market for consumer financial services and products. Each of these corporations maintains 200 million credit files on American consumers, selling more than 2 million reports each day. Their products have a direct and growing impact on Americans' economic security and opportunity, determining whether a consumer will end up paying a higher interest rate for a loan or a higher premium for car or homeowner's insurance; have their application for a loan or insurance denied; be turned down for a job, or even be terminated from their current one. Credit reports and scores produced by these companies can affect the way Americans are treated by landlords, utility companies, and hospitals. 
The component parts of the industry also merit consideration: major companies such as FICO and VantageScore that assemble credit scoring models and create the credit scores relied upon by these agencies should also be considered ""larger participants"" and supervised by the CFPB. Nationwide resellers of consumer reporting information should also be defined as ""larger participants"" and subject to supervision due to their role in supplying consumer reports to lenders or other purchasers of consumer data. 
Nationwide consumer reporting agencies that compile and maintain files focused on consumers' insurance claims, medical records, history as a tenant, and check writing history should also be defined as ""larger participants"" based on their significance for consumers making purchases in a given industry.   
In the case of the consumer reporting agencies, many companies offer a range of consumer reports that are considered financial products under the Fair Credit Reporting Act as well as some that are not. The CFPB should define these entire companies as larger participants and supervise all of the database and information products about consumers sold by these companies. This broad designation will protect consumers from evolving risks in the way this information is used and will reflect the way that these consumer reports are mixed together and used by the same banks, creditors, insurance companies, other businesses.
The CFPB should act to safeguard consumers wherever they live, protecting consumers who are not currently being shielded from violations of federal law by larger non-banks.  In particular, the CFPB must act to ensure that non-banks cannot violate federal law simply because they operate primarily in states that have fewer law-enforcement resources.
Demos appreciates the opportunity to comment on the rule defining larger non-bank participants.

"From the day he launched his campaign with dire warnings about border-crossing “bad hombres,” Donald Trump has preyed on some Americans’ worst biases around immigration. Trump has since exhorted Congress to allocate tens of billions of dollars for a border wall, stepped up arrests of immigrants, separated Latino children from their parents, and pushed to expedite deportations. [...]
While undocumented workers may be the target, these immigration enforcement actions have great potential to harm the very workers Trump claims to stand for. After all, labor standards, from the minimum wage to workplace safety regulations, are most effective when they are universal.

"This year in the United States, International Workers’ Day, also known as May Day, actually feels like the day of resistance and struggle it was intended to be.
Last week teachers in Arizona and Colorado walked off the job, shutting down schools in a collective effort not only to improve their own abysmal pay but also to reverse the years of massive cuts to public education that have left their students without the resources to succeed academically. Arizona teachers are also speaking out for school bus drivers, cafeteria staff, and other school employees who are underpaid.
Arizona Congressman Raul Grijalva points out that in a state where half of public school students come from communities of color (mostly Latino and Native American communities), the underfunding of education is also a crucial issue of racial equity.
The New York Times recently highlighted the way that policymakers in state and local governments nationwide acted to degrade the quality of public sector employment across the board, reducing public payrolls to make room for tax cuts that benefit corporations and the wealthy. In standing up for themselves, their students, and the other working people who enable our public schools to function, teachers in Arizona and Colorado, as well as earlier waves of striking teachers in West Virginia, Oklahoma and Kentucky, are pushing back against exactly this politics of austerity.
Private sector workers face an even greater squeeze as profits—and the largesse from recent corporate tax cuts—are funneled overwhelmingly to shareholders and chief executives. Newly available public data from the federal Security and Exchange Commission reveals just how tremendous the gap between working people and corporate bosses has grown: The CEO of Yum Brands, which owns KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell, made 1,358 times more than the typical employee keeping those restaurants operating. Walmart’s CEO took home 1,188 times more than the company’s median worker. It’s no wonder that working people organizing through groups like the Fight for $15 and OUR Walmart have taken collective action to demand a better deal on the job. For their part, corporations complain that having to reveal the pay ratios is “a pain in the butt.” 
At AT&T, which had promised to invest its tax windfall in its workforce, thousands of workers in Illinois,  Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin and are poised to go on strike, denouncing the company for breaking its promise and eliminating jobs, closing call centers, and shifting work to low-paid contractors.
From airline catering workers to graduate teaching and research assistants at the nation’s most elite universities, to farm workers and domestic workers fed up with laws that leave them vulnerable to sexual assault and harassment on the job, working people are joining with co-workers to call for fair pay and treatment at work.
The federal government could do a great deal to support them all. In our new briefing book, Everyone’s Economy, my Demos colleagues and I lay out an array of policies to lift up working people, from raising job standards through a higher minimum wage and paid sick days, to devoting more resources to combatting discrimination and harassment on the job, to restoring our freedom to join together with co-workers to negotiate for a fair return on work. We make the case for a public jobs guarantee, arguing that it will raise standards for a broad range of workers and should prioritize racial equity.
As my colleague Tamara Draut points out in the new edition of her book Sleeping Giant, America’s contemporary working class continues to be overlooked because of preconceptions about race and gender that lead us to pay attention to white men in hard hats while ignoring women of color at the checkout counter. The strikes and mobilizations around the country suggest that the “sleeping giant” may be stirring.",blog
"Replacing our failed for-profit credit reporting system with a public credit registry will benefit consumers and reduce racial wealth inequality.
Decisions drawing on credit data reproduce and spread existing racial inequality, making it harder to achieve true economic equity.
Credit reports and scores directly impact Americans’ economic security and opportunity. Credit history can affect the way Americans are treated by lenders, landlords, utility companies, hospitals and employers. Having a poor credit history or a “thin file” with insufficient credit information to generate a credit score can mean a consumer will end up paying more for loans and insurance (or have trouble even getting them in the first place). Misuses of credit history are prevalent and harmful: Job seekers can be denied work based on their credit history, and the Trump administration has even proposed using credit history to determine whether immigrants should be eligible for permanent residency. Most harmfully, our credit system is built on—and continues to reinforce and expand—deep racial inequities.  Generations of discrimination in employment, lending, education and housing have produced significant racial disparities in credit history. Past discrimination is baked into current determinations of creditworthiness: Credit scores and other lending algorithms disproportionately represent black and Latino loan applicants as “riskier” customers. As a result, decisions drawing on credit data reproduce and spread existing racial inequality, making it harder to achieve true economic equity. 
America’s credit reporting system is controlled by 3 big, for-profit companies—Experian, Transunion, and Equifax—which collect lending and payment data on 220 million Americans without consumers’ permission or approval, and there is no way for consumers to opt out from having personal financial data collected. The algorithms that determine our creditworthiness are not publicly available, and consumers must pay to access their own credit reports and scores (beyond one free report from each company per year). Errors are common, and people of color experience higher error rates than white households. Meanwhile these errors are notoriously difficult to correct, as credit reporting companies have failed to make the investments necessary to investigate disputed items. It is lenders—not American consumers—who are the customers of these companies. Our consumer data is their product; thus, these corporations are not accountable to consumers. The companies have no incentive to be concerned about racial equity or fairness.  
 
A public credit registry will develop algorithms that diminish the impact of past discrimination.
Demos proposes establishing a public credit registry housed in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. This publicly run credit registry will gradually replace the current for-profit corporate system, and is designed to be responsive to consumer needs and equity concerns rather than the corporate bottom line. A public credit registry will develop algorithms that diminish the impact of past discrimination, deliver transparent credit scoring, provide greater data security and offer a publicly accountable way to resolve disputes. The use of credit information for non-lending purposes, such as employment, housing, and insurance, will be curtailed.
See our full report for more on the transition to a public credit registry, tips on how to talk about the public credit registry, and links to further resources.The report also includes a discussion of additional policies to ensure fair and equitable credit for all, including banning predatory lending, reforming debt collection practices, ensuring fairness in bankruptcy, prohibiting forced arbitration, defending the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and improving jobs and public services to reduce families’ need to resort to debt in the first place.",policy-briefs
"In 1935, with the passage of the Social Security Act, our national leaders made a promise to all citizens: after a lifetime of hard work, no older American would suffer from poverty in their old age. The passage of this landmark legislation was the embodiment of a deeply shared value: a dignified, economically secure retirement. Seventy-five years later, however, our nation has greatly changed and our ability to uphold this value is severely threatened.
Social Security was never intended to be the sole source of income for retirees. Rather, it was supposed to be a supplement to other steady forms of retirement income, primarily employer-provided “traditional pensions,” as well as individual savings. Throughout the last few decades, however, traditional pensions have been largely replaced by employer-based retirement savings plans, shifting the risk of retirement onto workers, forcing them to gamble their retirement savings in the stock market or on even riskier investments. In addition, workers have been suffering from increasing economic insecurity, resulting in a decrease in personal savings. Even Social Security, the bedrock of retirement for most workers, is under political attack by those ideologically opposed to the system.
The erosion of retirement savings will take a toll: a recent report by McKinsey & Company asserts that, if current patterns continue, the average working American household is facing a 37 percent shortfall in the income they need in retirement. This shortfall is larger both for lower-income households and for younger workers.1 Forty-four percent of households have no retirement savings accounts at all.2 As a result, less than half of Americans are projected to have sufficient income to adequately maintain living standards in retirement, even when Social Security is accounted for.3 The economic crisis makes matters still worse: Americans are increasingly withdrawing money from their existing retirement accounts to meet immediate needs. Many older people are postponing retirement or trying to reenter the workforce at a time of high unemployment.4
401(k)-style plans are an inadequate solution to the nation’s mounting retirement crisis. First, they’re expensive. The exorbitant fees charged by firms that manage 401(k) accounts can cost workers a quarter or more of their retirement savings. Over a lifetime, these fees can add up to more than $155,000 in losses for the average household.5 Fees are levied on employers’ matching contributions as well. Another serious problem is the way that 401(k)s place the burden of investment risk exclusively on individual workers. After working throughout their lives, older Americans relying on individual retirement plans could lose their savings in a market crash, invest so conservatively that they ensure themselves weak returns, or outlive the funds they have been able to save. Pension-style plans, meanwhile, ensure security by spreading these risks among many plan participants over a long time horizon – no individual puts their entire retirement in danger.
Our proposal for American Retirement Accounts, a modification of the Guaranteed Retirement Account plan proposed by Demos fellow Teresa Ghilarducci, would establish voluntary, portable accounts that workers and employers could contribute to. While employers would be required to set up the accounts, they would not be obligated to contribute. The government would defray administrative expenses. In addition, a $600 annual government contribution would be given to everyone participating. Professional private sector managers would invest the ARA money at low fees, with the government guaranteeing an inflation-adjusted rate of return of at least 3 percent to ensure retirement security. When individuals retire, the value of their account assets would be distributed back in the form of an annuitized pension, similar to plans currently available to university professors, nonprofit employees, and public-sector workers.
The proposal is designed to provide retirement security by eliminating market risk (since the government’s guaranteed minimum return would protect against market crashes), longevity risk (through the annuitization of benefits, ensuring fixed payments throughout an individual’s life), and investment risk (through conservative investments in low-fee accounts). 
Funding for the program could be raised by capping 401(k) tax deductions at $5,000 annually. This tax subsidy disproportionately benefits people with high-incomes who already benefit the most from public policies and market incentives.

"Next week, Washington, D.C.’s municipal government will vote on new legislation that, if enacted, would guarantee people working in the District up to 11 weeks of paid leave to care for a new baby or child. But this is just the latest in a string of state and local governments taking action to address the needs of working parents and their families.[...]
The growing number of states and cities stepping up to support working parents is encouraging. Providing paid leave, stable work schedules, jobs that pay family-supporting wages, and affordable high-quality child care and early education would go a long way toward supporting working parents. Guaranteeing the reproductive rights necessary to make decisions about whether and when to become a parent would further strengthen families’ economic stability.
Yet to address the needs of working parents nationwide, the growing demand for these policies must be heard, not only in city halls and state capitals, but in the halls of Congress and the White House as well.",media
"Today the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) released its annual assessment of the CARD Act, a landmark 2009 credit card reform bill. Before the legislation went into effect, banking industry lobbyists argued that the regulation would inevitably raise credit card rates, choke off the availability of credit, and harm more people than it would help.
Six years after the bill’s passage, these woes have not come to pass. Instead, the CFPB’s report finds that consumers are paying less for their credit cards than they did before the law, with dramatic savings on fees resulting in a total cost of credit nearly two percentage points lower than it was before the enactment of the CARD Act. Far from being choked off, credit availability has continued to expand for consumers, increasing 10 percent since 2012 with new accounts growing faster than the adult population.
Overall, consumers have saved $7 billion in late fees and $9 billion on over-limit fees—an especially pernicious “gotcha” fee that was virtually banned by the new regulation. In a 2014 data brief, Demos found that the reduction in over-limit fees especially benefitted African American and Latino households with credit card debt.
The CFPB points out that more than 60 percent of American adults own at least one credit card account, and use these cards—a lot. In the first six months of 2015, more than 14.5 billion credit card transactions accounted for more than $1.4 trillion in purchase volume.
Contrary to the warnings of industry lobbyists, the CARD Act is working successfully to make credit cards safer and more fair. And Demos is proud to have played a crucial role in making the CARD Act a reality, drawing on our long research expertise on the impact of credit card debt on American families.
The success of the CARD Act should make us think twice about knee-jerk denunciations of regulation, from the minimum wage, to environmental protection, to efforts to stop discrimination. We should also recognize the value of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau itself, which is now under renewed attack from financial companies that would prefer to cheat consumers with greater impunity. Now more than ever, Americans need the financial protections and oversight the CFPB provides and should protect this vital agency from efforts to weaken it.",blog
"UrbanDictionary.com defines a McJob  as “any menial, low-paying, unskilled, dead-end job, including (but not limited to) those in the fast food industry, which requires zero creative or intellectual involvement, and whose sole motivation is a paycheck (i.e., no one works a McJob because they like it or care about the work). . . The term's allusion to mass-produced fast food implies both the mechanical, unfulfilling nature of the work, and the disposable, interchangeable manner in which the company treats its employees.”
In other words, these jobs offer as little in pay, benefits, training, job security and safety protections as the law allows. It’s a shamefully low bar – except that it’s apparently not low enough for some fast food employers. A survey of 500 fast food workers in New York City commissioned by worker organization Fast Food Forward reportedly shows that the vast majority of employees in the city’s fast food industry say they have, in one way or another, been cheated out of wages owed.
While the report is not yet available online, Josh Eidelson writes today in the Nation that
The Fast Food Forward report identifies several types of violations as prevalent in the city’s fast food industry: employees working, without pay, before or after their shift; employees working overtime without being paid time-and-a-half; employees working during their breaks or not receiving breaks; and delivery employees not being reimbursed for expenses like gasoline or safety equipment.
An earlier study by the National Employment Law Project found that an estimated 586,322 workers in New York City’s low-wage industries (including, but not limited to fast food) suffered some type of employment or labor law violation in the course of a week.
Fast food workers have organized a series of one-day strikes in cities across the country, calling for better pay and union representation. But the new findings reinforce the fact that they need all the help they can get.
That’s why it’s particularly encouraging to learn that New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is investigating wage violations in the fast food industry, according to the New York Times. [Full disclosure: my husband is an employee of the New York Attorney General’s office, although he has not been involved with this investigation.] Should Schneiderman’s office have sufficient evidence to bring a case, prosecutions will be aided by New York’s relatively new Wage Theft Prevention Act, which increases penalties for cheating workers and prohibits retaliation against employees who complain.
Legal employment conditions – a minimum wage of just $7.25 an hour, with no requirements that employers provide health coverage, job security or even (until new legislation goes into effect)  paid sick days – are abysmal enough. Lower standards are unacceptable.",blog
"The credit reporting industry likes to argue that credit checks reveal something about an individual’s character or ability to act responsibly. But two recent newspaper reports underscore just how dubious a proposition this is: this weekend, the New York Times scrutinized the destructive toll out-of-control medical bills can take on credit, while the Columbus Dispatch trained its sights on the frequency of credit reporting errors. 
The Columbus Dispatch has launched a four-part investigation exploring the prevalence of errors in credit reports and the fiendish difficulty of getting them corrected. In fact, the Dispatch finds, “Americans are left virtually powerless to erase the mistakes.” 
During a yearlong investigation, The Dispatch collected and analyzed nearly 30,000 consumer complaints filed with the Federal Trade Commission and attorneys general in 24 states that alleged violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act by the three largest credit-reporting agencies in the United States — Equifax, Experian and TransUnion.
Industry observers say it is among the most comprehensive reviews ever conducted of complaints against credit-reporting agencies.
The complaints document the inability of consumers to correct errors that range from minor to financially devastating. Consumers said the agencies can’t even correct the most obvious mistakes: That’s not my birth date. That’s not my name. I’m not dead.
Nearly a quarter of the complaints to the FTC and more than half of the complaints to the attorneys general involved mistakes in consumers’ financial accounts for credit cards, mortgages or car loans. Houses sold in bank-approved “short sales,” at less than the value of the mortgage, were listed as foreclosures. Car loans that had been paid off were reported as repossessions. Credit cards that had been paid off and closed years earlier showed as delinquent.
As Demos demonstrated in our report, “Discrediting America,” credit reporting errors can have a devastating impact. The Columbus Dispatch found something similar, powerfully documenting “the plight of thousands who, through no fault of their own, have been denied the chance to buy a home or a car, take out a loan for college, rent an apartment, land a job, join the Armed Forces, receive medical care or even open a checking account.”
Even if no error occurred, bad credit may have more to do with unavoidable medical expenses than any underlying character flaw, suggests the New York Times report. Because a growing portion of medical providers’ revenues come directly from patients, the Times finds, doctors and hospitals are turning over more debt to collection agencies, and turning it over more quickly.
FICO, which produces one of the most popular credit scores used by lenders, said it viewed different types of collection agency accounts — medical-related or otherwise — as equally damaging. For someone with a spotless credit history, “it wouldn’t surprise me if their score dropped by 100 points or more [due to a late medical bill],” said Frederic Huynh, a principal analytic scientist at FICO. And the blemish does not entirely disappear for seven years.
Consumer advocates argue that this is unfair. After all, medical debt is usually something people do not volunteer for, and billing errors and figuring out who owes what can often take months…
“You can’t afford to buy a policy, you can’t afford to buy coverage through your job, and you end up in the E.R., and you have to pay for that visit, and even more you have to pay at non-negotiated prices,” said Sara Collins, a vice president at Commonwealth, referring to the fact that the uninsured often pay much more than the rates that insurers negotiate. “So if it becomes part of your credit history, it strikes me as really unfair.”
But good policy could make a difference. The New York Times suggests ways the Medical Debt Responsibility Act and the Affordable Care Act  could help Americans saddled with medical debt. The Columbus Dispatch turns directly to President Obama, who provided a written statement in response to their study, and cites the potential for the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to address credit reporting errors. Through legislation or regulation, it’s clear that consumers need all the help they can get.",blog
"The Department of Labor recently moved to begin rolling back the overtime pay rule, taking a critical benefit away from millions of working people and their families. The retrenchment puts the administration squarely on the side of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other big-business lobbyists—rigging the economy further in service of the very interests voters already believe are unfairly profiting at their expense. It is the latest in a long series of betrayals from a candidate who vowed to stand up for ordinary working Americans.
The overtime pay rule, finalized in May 2016, is a much-needed update to the pay rate at which salaried employees must receive additional compensation for working more than 40 hours a week. The rule doubles the salary threshold (from $23,660 to $47,476 per year) under which most salaried workers are guaranteed overtime pay for working longer hours. The rule also requires that the pay level be automatically updated every 3 years to ensure that workers continue to be paid the compensation they deserve. The update was long overdue: while 62 percent of full-time workers qualified for overtime pay in 1975, according to the Department of Labor, just 7 percent were eligible for overtime in 2015.
If the rule had gone into effect as intended, the new overtime rule would have begun boosting workers’ pay in December 2016. The Economic Policy Institute estimates that 12.5 million workers and their families would have benefitted. According to an analysis by the Department of Labor, the overtime rule would have resulted in an average annual increase in pay of $1.2 billion per year. Since women, people of color, and younger workers are the most likely to work in moderately-paid salaried jobs, these workers would have seen the greatest gains.
Yet the rule is not just about pay. As I explained when the overtime rule was first introduced:
One advantage of the new rule is that employers have a number of strategies to adapt, many of which also end up benefitting working people. For example, if employers don’t want to pay time-and-a-half to current employees, they’ll hire new employees to do the work: Goldman Sachs estimated the rule would create 120,000 new jobs at the same time that existing employees are no longer so overworked. Employers could also respond by raising the salaries of employees earning near the new threshold so that they’re no longer eligible for overtime. In this case, workers miss out on overtime but get a raise. Of course, employers could also cut employees’ base salary, leaving workers without extra time or money, yet in practice employers seldom reduce the pay of current workers.
In fact, as Demos President Heather McGhee noted in a video about the importance of the overtime rule, updating overtime is ultimately a “win” for employers as well, because it will help to strengthen a national economy undermined by stagnant pay.
We have seen how minimum wage increases at the state and local level have enabled the lowest-paid workers to finally see their wages begin to recover from the Great Recession. Enabling overtime pay increases to go into effect would enable many moderate- and middle-income workers to get a pay boost as well.
However, a lawsuit stopped the implementation of the overtime rule. And now the Trump administration has issued a new “request for information,” disregarding the 270,000 public comments the Department of Labor had already taken into account in formulating the rule. The administration’s request for information suggests that multiple overtime pay standards could be implemented, defeating the entire purpose of a fundamental standard that applies to all working people.
The overtime pay rule represents a very real way that our democratically-elected officials can change the rules of the game, un-rigging the economy in a way that actually benefits ordinary Americans. We should not allow Trump and his corporate lobbyist friends to strip this benefit away. ",blog
"Wal-Mart for increasing the starting salary of workers from $9 to $10 an hour, which would boost the wages of 500,000 employees, along with other boosts in specialized sections. While this step is a positive one, a new Demos brief argues that despite this new policy, Wal-Mart wages and schedules still aren't livable. Demos finds that the new $10 an hour wage ""still does not provide enough income to support the basic needs of a single adult working Walmart's full-time schedule of 34 hours per week in any state in the country.""",media
"I fear that John Boehner is not going to raise the minimum wage. 
It doesn’t matter that 76 percent of Americans support a wage hike, or that studies indicate that the minimum wage reduces poverty and that raising it would boost our economy and create jobs. And I’m worried that if, in his State of the Union Address next week, President Obama again calls on Congress to raise the minimum wage, even in the most powerful and evocative terms, that won’t move Boehner to act either. 
But there is a glimmer of hope: when it comes to at least one group of low-paid workers—the more than 500,000 low-wage employees of federal contractors—President Obama doesn’t have to wait for Congress in order to take action and improve jobs. 
The President can act himself, through an executive order similar to the one President Johnson signed in 1965 to ban employment discrimination by contractors. According to the Washington Post, the President is considering announcing a “Good Jobs” executive order in his State of the Union Address next week. He should do it. In signing such an order, President Obama would not only improve conditions for low-paid contract workers, but would also give greater momentum to the fight for a federal minimum wage increase that would benefit everyone. 
In research my Demos colleague Robert Hiltonsmith and I completed in May, we found that the federal government is the nation’s leading low-wage employer, with nearly two million private sector employees paid through federal contracts, grants, loans, concession agreements and property leases were paid $12 or less per hour. Despite a proud history of efforts to ensure that employees working on behalf of America are treated fairly on the job, and that companies that have the privilege of doing business with the United States are upholding high standards of employment practices, many federally funded jobs today have been subject to the same race to the bottom that has lowered standards for other work.  
Paying wages close to the inadequate federal minimum wage is a disgrace in its own right, but a study by the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee revealed that federal contractors are also flagrant repeat violators of our labor laws, often paying less than the minimum wage and denying workers overtime pay. According to committee chairman Senator Tom Harkin, nearly 30 percent of companies receiving the highest penalties for violations of federal labor law are also federal contractors. In fact, the 49 federal contractors liable for major violations of labor law were responsible for close to 1,800 distinct enforcement actions by the Department of Labor over six years and were obligated to pay $196 million in penalties and back wages. 
While the nation has traditionally held companies performing work on behalf of the American people to a higher standard, the Senate report shows they now cluster near the bottom of the barrel. 
The low pay and labor law violations harm all of us. When our tax dollars underwrite bad jobs, economic recovery is stalled. There is a ripple effect as low-paid workers and their families have little to spend at businesses in their communities, hampering economic growth that could be creating more jobs. Poorly-paid workers also contribute less in taxes and are more likely to rely on public benefits to care for their families. This is one reason why raising wages for low-paid contract workers would not end up adding significantly to public costs: federal taxpayers are already paying for these workers twice, through both the contracts themselves and the workforce subsidies in the form of Medicaid, food stamps, home heating assistance and other benefits that low-paid employees of federal contractors must rely on to make ends meet. 
In fact, if we are interested in reducing public costs for contracts, the best place to look is at the lavish pay packages of contracting executives. Extrapolating from a study by the Government Accountability Office, my colleague Robert Hiltonsmith and I found that taxpayers spend an estimated $20.8 to $23.9 billion a year to compensate top executives of federal contractors. While Congress acted in December to reduce the amount the public agrees pay for the compensation of contracting executives, we still offer them more than twice what we pay the Vice President of the United States for his service to the country. In many cases, performing work in-house by federal employees, who also tend to earn more livable wages at the low end, would be more cost-effective than contracting out to firms with highly-compensated executives. 
President Obama has recognized that making the economy function for working people is “the defining challenge of our time” and vowed that, in the face of partisan obstruction, “whatever executive authority I have to help the middle class, I’ll use it.” An executive order improving the wages of low-paid contract workers would be a decisive way to do so. The nation as a whole would benefit from an economy where all workers earn good wages—but as long as Congress blocks more comprehensive action, the President himself must act to see that the people working on behalf of our nation are paid and treated fairly, establishing a powerful example for all other employers to follow.",blog
"This morning the New York City Council will hold a hearing on legislation to guarantee paid sick days  to all working New Yorkers. The measure has been pending for several years with repeated compromises  to address the concerns of employers. While the legislation is backed by 83 percent of New Yorkers  and has strong enough support on the City Council to override a mayoral veto, Council Speaker and mayoral candidate Christine Quinn has so far refused to permit a vote, citing concerns about how small companies will deal with the requirement that their employees be permitted to earn up to five paid days off a year to recover from illness or care for a sick loved one.
In testimony I submitted to the Council today, I argue that this concern is misplaced: the concrete evidence of how this policy has operated in practice in the other jurisdictions where it has been implemented strongly suggests that guaranteeing paid sick days does not harm employment or the growth of small businesses. Here’s an excerpt from Demos’ testimony:
Let me begin by saying something we all know: everybody gets sick. At one time or another, even the heartiest and healthiest  among us catches a nasty bug, gets an infection, or needs medical attention because of an accident. We’re human beings, and most of us also have parents or spouses or children or another loved one who depends on us in a case of medical emergency or temporary illness. Yet an estimated 1.58 million working New Yorkers  primarily low-income workers, cannot take a single day off work to recuperate or care for a sick loved one without missing a paycheck.  The result is a more fearful and precarious labor force, just one illness away from slipping into poverty – or from slipping deeper into poverty. Is that the city we want to be?
We don’t have to be that city, if the Council finally votes on, and passes, the Paid Sick Time Act.

"Will American families finally catch a break?
As Hillary Clinton takes the podium at the New School today for a major economic policy address said to focus on issues important to families, she has her work cut out for her.
American families weathered decades of wage stagnation  and mounting consumer debt, capped off by a recession that depleted household wealth, reduced homeownership, and threw millions out of their jobs. Through it all, as politicians trumpeted their fealty to “family values,” American parents were left largely on their own to find and pay for child care and preschool education. Alone among advanced economies, American parents went without a guarantee of paid leave to care for a new baby, or even a handful of paid days off work to stay home when the six-year-old comes down with the flu.
Now however, there is new energy behind proposals to shore up American families. Millions of same-sex couples, of course, saw their families strengthened immeasurably with nationwide recognition of marriage rights. Meanwhile from Oregon to Connecticut, states are passing laws to guarantee paid sick days and to hike the minimum wage, while President Obama called childcare a “national economic priority” in his last State of the Union address and is working to boost overtime pay without the need to go through Congress.
As she aims to “secure a foundation for working families” the wind is at Clinton’s back. Today we’ll begin to hear more about what she’ll do with it.
Paid sick days are the low-hanging fruit. Recent polls  find that 79 percent of likely 2016 voters favor a requirement that employers provide paid sick days, including a majority of Republicans.  In the years since paid sick days laws were first enacted in the U.S., numerous studies  have found that they do not impede job growth or harm small businesses. Pushing for a policy similar to the The Healthy Families Act,  introduced in Congress should be an easy choice.
The Schedules that Work Act, aimed at making it easier for hourly employees with unpredictable and irregular work hours to get schedules that enable them to meet the needs of their families should also be on Clinton’s agenda.
Paid family leave, child care, and universal preschool are tougher because the policies would actually carry a public price tag – in some cases, a substantial one. For example, President Obama’s Preschool for All Plan, part of all of his budget proposals since 2013, includes a 10-year, $75 billion investment in federal-state partnerships to offer high-quality prekindergarten to 4-year-olds from low-and moderate-income families. Yet the costs for preschool, child care, and leave are already being paid – by strapped families with child care expenses that rival the price of college tuition and by the nation as a whole, which misses out on the opportunity to close achievement gaps, support working parents, and give the next generation of citizens the best start in life.  Here too Clinton will find broad public support for bold solutions: 70 percent of Americans – including a narrow majority of Republicans – favor using federal money to ensure universal access to preschool, according to a Gallup poll last fall.
A substantial national investment in early care and education also provides an opportunity to generate the type of family-supporting jobs the nation needs. According to Child Care Aware, approximately 2.2 million workers are currently employed caring for children under age 5. Among them are child care workers who earn an average hourly wage of just $10.44 an hour, or $21,710 annually. Raising pay in this critical profession to a more livable wage of $15 an hour, a many workers are now calling for, represents an opportunity to further increase professional standards for those helping to nurture our youngest citizens and to lift incomes for workers' own families and households.
The time is ripe for Clinton to begin filling in policy specifics. It’s one thing to call for child care and another to create a plan that truly enables families to get care that is secure, affordable, nurturing and educational. Similarly, calling for paid leave is different from standing up to the Chamber of Commerce (and its many allies in Congress) to secure the policy Americans have needed for decades. Today we’ll begin to see if Clinton will propose solutions that truly meet the scope of the challenges faced by America’s families. If front-running Clinton will not, her rivals, including Senator Bernie Sanders and Governor Martin O'Malley, may increasingly appeal to voters on these critical issues.",blog
"The credit reporting industry has given us plenty to complain about:  credit reports too often contain errors,  the errors are fiendishly hard to fix, reports and scores are not accessible enough to consumers, and credit information is increasingly being used for a variety of extraneous purposes, among numerous other problems (for the full bill of complaint, see my paper Discrediting America).  While many of these problems will require legislation or regulation to fix, some can be addressed immediately with the assistance of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau which begins accepting consumers’ individual complaints about credit reporting today.
 
The CFPB announces that it can work on complaints including:
Unfortunately, the complaint database cannot help jobseekers angry that poor credit was held against them in a job search (currently perfectly legal under federal law) or that they must pay just to look at a credit score compiled from data about their own personal behavior. Still, it's likely to be more effective than kvetching on PissedConsumer.com  and will help to focus the CFPB’s investigatory and enforcement actions.

"Chairman Capito, Ranking Member Meeks, and members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to submit the following statement for the record as part of today’s hearing.
Demos is pleased that the subcommittee is taking the time today to discuss the impact of our credit reporting system on Americans.  Today credit reports and scores have a direct and growing impact on Americans’ economic security and opportunity. Having poor credit can mean a consumer will end up paying a higher interest rate for a loan or a higher premium for car or homeowner’s insurance; have their application for a loan or insurance denied; be turned down for a job, or even be terminated from their current one. Credit history can affect the way Americans are treated by landlords, utility companies, and hospitals.
In particular, we would like to focus on what we see as the inappropriate use of credit checks as an employment screening tool by employers.    
In the midst of continuing high unemployment, millions of Americans are out of work and struggling to keep up with bills for even the most basic expenses. What they need more than anything is a job. But for too many people, access to employment is blocked by the growing practice of employment credit checks. Employers in the public and private sectors now routinely check the credit histories of prospective employees and may use the information to deny them jobs.
Credit checks exclude qualified applicants – including people whose credit was damaged as a result of medical debt, divorce, layoffs, predatory lending, identity theft, or other events beyond their control – from the employment they desperately need. Credit checks also discriminate against low-income people and people of color, who have been disproportionately impacted by the economic downturn.
The campaign to end employment credit checks, which is widely supported by dozens of national civil rights organizations, is fundamentally about economic justice. It’s about putting qualified people back to work and ensuring that all job seekers be given a fair shot at gainful employment.
Credit reports were developed to predict loan repayment, but are increasingly used to deny employment
Credit reports were developed as a tool for lenders to evaluate whether someone would be a good credit risk based on their past payment history. These reports detail whether someone has fallen behind on their bills, whether they have had to declare bankruptcy, and if they’ve faced foreclosure. Yet over the past few years, the credit reporting industry, which is dominated by three large multinational corporations, has reaped profits from selling this personal consumer information to employers. According to a poll by the Society for Human Resources Management, close to 50 percent of employers now conduct employment credit checks for some or all positions when they are hiring.2
Credit checks are not reliable for employment
Credit reports are marketed to employers as a means to gauge an applicant’s character or likelihood to commit theft or fraud. Yet no empirical evidence has demonstrated that reviewing a job applicant’s personal credit history prevents crime. In fact, several studies have failed to find a correlation between credit history and criminal behavior.3 A spokesperson for TransUnion, one of the major credit reporting companies, even admitted: “we don’t have any research to show any statistical correlation between what’s in somebody’s credit report… and their likelihood to commit fraud.”4 Credit reports can be a good indicator of the tremendous economic stresses that are facing households, including whether they have had to incur debts to pay for basic expenses or medical care, but they are not a crystal ball revealing who will be a reliable employee.
Employment credit checks are discriminatory
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has repeatedly warned that employment credit checks have a discriminatory impact on African American and Latino applicants, whose credit histories have suffered from discrimination in lending, housing and employment itself.5 Studies by the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Trade Commission and others have consistently found that average credit scores of African Americans are lower than those of whites.6 In addition, credit continues to be offered on discriminatory terms: in the last decade predatory lending schemes targeting communities of color compounded historic disparities in wealth and assets, leaving African-Americans, Latinos, and other people of color at greater risk of foreclosure and default on loans. Employment credit checks can perpetuate and amplify this injustice, translating a legacy of unfair lending into another subtle means of employment discrimination. Numerous civil rights organizations including the NAACP, the National Council of La Raza, and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, have publicly opposed the use of employment credit checks.
Credit reporting errors are common and impact employment decisions in unpredictable ways
A comprehensive 2013 study by the Federal Trade Commission found that one in five American consumers had a material error (an error that negatively impacted their credit history) on a credit report from one of three major credit reporting companies.7 While not all of these errors are serious enough to affect consumer borrowing, the impact on employment is far broader because what employers look for in a credit report—and how much they weigh different factors like late bills, foreclosures, or accounts in collection—is entirely subjective. A credit reporting mistake that is too small to make a difference in applying for credit might nevertheless stand out to an employer and cost someone a job. At the same time, credit reporting errors are notoriously difficult for consumers to resolve.
Employment credit checks are a violation of privacy
Americans should not have to expose a painful divorce or past medical condition just to get a job. Yet because family break-up and medical problems are among the leading reasons that Americans become unable to pay their debts, these deeply personal concerns are often revealed in an employment credit check, particularly if an applicant is asked to “explain” an imperfect credit history. Medical confidentiality and long-standing protections against disability discrimination may fall by the wayside when a prospective employer scrutinizes a job applicant’s personal credit history.
States and cities are taking action to end this unjust practice
Political leaders are waking up to the need to remove this unfair barrier to employment. Ten states – Washington, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, California, Maryland, Oregon, Vermont, Nevada, and Colorado – have recently passed laws restricting the use of credit reports in employment. Many additional states are considering legislation on employment credit checks this legislative session. The city of Hartford, Connecticut has also acted to end the use of credit checks for its own municipal hiring. A federal bill, the Equal Employment for All Act, is currently pending before both the U.S. Senate and the House. Yet much work remains to be done. Today, too many Americans are trapped in an untenable Catch-22: they are unable to secure a job because of damaged credit and unable to escape debt and improve their credit because they cannot find work. At a time when so many are confronting economic hardship, we must act to lower barriers to employment and give people the opportunity to work their way out of debt.

"Is the problem in America today that workers are too powerful in comparison with the corporations that employ them? Are our wages too high? Do too many of us have health coverage and retirement plans?
If so, then the bill just passed by the Indiana House of Representatives offers a solution: undermine the ability of working people to organize for better pay and benefits. De-fund their unions. Over time, research suggests, so-called Right to Work (RTW) laws like the one in Indiana will result in declining wages and leave workers less likely to get health insurance or pensions through their jobs. While the experience of other states that enacted RTW laws indicates that the deterioration of pay and benefits won’t succeed in luring jobs, as its proponents assert, it will yield a cheaper (and likely more docile) workforce.
The average full-time, full-year worker in a RTW state earns about $1,500 less each year than a similar worker in a non-right to work state, according to a study by economists Elise Gould and Heidi Shierholz.
Here’s how the paycheck shrinking formula works. When a union is recognized by law, it’s legally required to represent all workers in a defined bargaining unit: to negotiate contracts on their behalf and handle their workplace grievances, for example. Workers are not required to become members of the union, but, in most states, they are obligated to pay a fee in exchange for the service they get from the union. Indiana, however, is poised to bar workers and their bosses from agreeing to any contract that includes these fees. Unions would instead have to provide representation services free of charge to anyone at a unionized workplace who chooses not to pay.
The result is a massive free-rider problem: if people can get a union’s services without having to pay for them, many will take the deal. This drains the unions of money and strength. Their ability to bargain declines. Over time, wages at unionized workplaces fall, unions lack the resources to organize new workers, and non-union employers in the area and industry also pay less because they no longer have to compete for workers with higher-wage union companies. The dynamic is similar for health care and pension benefits.
At the same time, the political angle is impossible to overlook. Unions are a powerful political constituency for the Democratic Party. It’s no surprise that Indiana’s Republican governor and Republican-dominated state legislature see political benefits in undermining organized labor. But rank-and-file Indiana voters, also predominantly registered Republicans, aren’t so sure. A recent poll reveals that only a third of the state’s electorate supports the RTW law, while another 30 percent feel they don’t know enough to form an opinion. Most voters would like the chance to decide the issue themselves via referendum, or at least to get the legislature to slow down and provide more time for debate.
What happens in Indiana will have ripple effects throughout the nation. If we believe that American workers earn too much and should have less bargaining power in the labor market, RTW is the formula for us.",blog
"Dear Senator:
Demos is a national, non-partisan, non-profit research and advocacy organization. As part of our research into policies to promote broadly shared prosperity, we have investigated the role that financial services deregulation has played in undermining the American middle class. For a century, government regulation of finance was the public structure responsible for protecting consumers, preventing and containing financial crises, and ensuring a dynamic, competitive financial sector. Thirty years ago, however, these essential structures began to be dismantled. The culmination of this radical deregulatory experiment was a banking meltdown that has cost Americans $14 trillion in household wealth, 8 million jobs, nearly 200 community bank closures and upwards of $14 trillion in taxpayer bailouts and subsidies. Bank lending has declined at its sharpest rate since 1942, and America's wealthiest banks are increasingly looking to Wall Street, not Main Street, for investment.
The policy shifts that created this situation are recent, and--given their enormous cost--must be reconsidered. Interstate regulations that limited bank size were loosened in 1994; the first credit default swap was in 1997; banks were allowed to engage in risky trading in 1999; derivatives were taken off exchanges in 2000; and the SEC lifted leverage limits for investment banks in 2004.
Congress now has the opportunity to erect new public structures guaranteeing stability, transparency and competition in banking. One critical structure would be a new, targeted limit on the size and leverage of our largest banks, as proposed by Senator Sherrod Brown and Senator Ted Kaufman in the SAFE Banking Act. The new limits would give financial institutions the opportunity to transform themselves into more manageable and sustainable firms - through a market process, maximizing shareholder value and ideally divesting riskier business lines from core banking.
The SAFE Banking Act would:
In several recent policy reports, Demos has examined the rapid increase in the size and complexity of American financial firms, and the way in which these trends relate to the factors (skewed incentives, excessive risk-taking, conflicts of interest, and opaque accounting, among them) that lay at the heart of the financial meltdown. In the U.S. today, six financial firms - Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo - have combined assets equal to 60 percent of GDP. That is three times the holdings of these and their antecedent institutions fifteen years ago. The SAFE Banking Act--as part of strong, comprehensive financial reform - is a critical measure that will restore balance to our economy.

"Dear Madam Chair and Secretary,
This letter supplements our letter of support dated November 20, 2013, for the SEC rule implementing Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. New research from Demos identifies growing CEO-to-worker compensation disparity as a material risk to shareholders. In addition to the broad public interest in corporate governance cited in our previous letter of support, it is increasingly clear that more information about pay disparity is critical for investors’ risk assessment and mitigation. An effectively designed and implemented disclosure rule would improve shareholders’ access to information regarding human capital management practices, increase the efficiency of capital markets, and support long-term stability and growth.
Our recent publication, Fast Food Failure: How CEO-to-Worker Pay Disparity Undermines the Industry and the Overall Economy, identifies the fast food industry as the main catalyst of extreme disparity in the most unequal sector of the economy, with negative consequences for firm performance. Human capital misallocations in the fast food industry have been accompanied by operational issues, legal and regulatory issues, and worker unrest, and expose shareholders to increasing risk. Yet without the firm-specific information mandated by Section 953(b) of Dodd-Frank, investors lack the requisite tools for strategic analytics and long-term, sustainable investment.
The Demos study relies on sector-and industry-level data from publicly available data sets in order to accommodate the lack of the firm-specific information. We find that the CEO-to-worker total compensation ratio in the fast food industry during 2013 reached more than 1000-to-1, and that inefficiencies, misplaced incentives, and performance problems were the result. Our study also shows that the US economy is increasingly reliant on employment in the most disparate sectors, reinforcing the problems of volatility and slow growth that have been shown to accompany extreme inequality. The findings do provide some tools for shareholders to assess their competing investment opportunities, and indicate a broader public concern about increasingly disparate pay practices in some sectors of the economy. 
Please see the attached report for more information on the implications of human capital management decisions for investors and the economy, and the usefulness of the CEO-to-worker pay ratio as an indicator of shareholder risk. In light of this information, we reiterate our previous comments suggesting the broadest practical inclusion in the median worker estimates. Including part time workers in the median worker calculation is essential in the sectors where disparity is consistently most severe – Accommodation and Food Services and Retail – because of the high dependence on part time labor in these sectors and the relationship between extreme disparity, underinvestment in front-line services, and the resulting deterioration in customer service and brand value at the firm. Since the risks associated with pay disparity are associated with misallocated resources across the production process, it is important to capture the full extent of human capital allocations.
We at Demos applaud your leadership on this issue and look forward to the finalization of the CEO-to-worker compensation disclosure rule.

"The Volcker Rule is a requirement in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 that is sometimes referred to as a “mini-Glass-Steagall.” 
The Volcker Rule is a requirement in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 that is sometimes referred to as a “mini-Glass-Steagall.” It is based on the same principle that kept banking safe between the Depression-era bank reforms and the Clinton-era deregulation, which included the repeal of Glass-Steagall: because of their importance to the credit system and the real economy, banks that take deposits (which are insured by the FDIC) should not take on certain risks inherent in the securities and derivatives markets. 
Once commercial banks were allowed in the late 1990s to merge with investment banks, own hedge funds and speculate in the markets with depositors’ funds, they became much more likely to fail. The Volcker Rule does not require the new combined banks to separate, but it does restore the idea that depository banks’ core function should be lending and facilitating trades for its customers, not taking on market price exposures that put the bank itself at risk.
The Volcker Rule accomplishes this by prohibiting banks from taking ""proprietary"" bets for their own profit, with taxpayer-backed deposit funds, and limiting banks’ investments in private leveraged investment funds. Experts studying pre-2008 bank activity found that proprietary trading and hedge and private equity fund speculation introduced needless volatility into the core credit markets, put banks in conflict with their clients, and diverted bank capital away from loans to America's small businesses and families. The Volcker Rule also bans firms from packaging risky securities for customers and then betting that they will fail, a practice at the center of the 2010 Goldman Sachs SEC fraud case.
 
Proprietary trading is defined in the rule as taking positions in securities or derivatives for the purpose of realizing profits from short-term price moves. The rule’s definition relies heavily on the concept of “trading accounts,” used already in the market risk capital rules applicable to banks, generally providing that positions held in trading accounts are held for the prohibited purpose. Banks should have no difficulty discerning what constitutes proprietary trading.
 
During the final days of Dodd-Frank debate, Senator Scott Brown (R-MA) was able to win an exception in the Volcker Rule's original private fund ban to allow banks to continue to own these funds, and invest up to 3% of their capital in them in the aggregate (and no more than 3% in any given fund). However, banks have to set aside in capital reserves amounts equal to their investment in these funds and are prohibited from bailing them out, as banks did during the 2008 crisis.
 
Proprietary trading can be immensely profitable to banks that have access to low cost deposits as a funding source, if they are allowed to put these funds at risk. This incentivizes trading activity far in excess of what is needed to provide for the intermediation of available investment money and its productive uses, such as funding productive assets, innovation, infrastructure, and credit needed by households. It has been referred to as a major source of the increasing “financialization” of the economy. The profits earned from financialization flow to the financial sector and burden the more productive sectors. This excess value extracted by the financial sector has been estimated to exceed $685 billion per year, and a large portion of this is derived from proprietary trading.
 
There are three ways to address the problem of “Too Big to Fail.”
 
The proposed rules are somewhat complex, but by no means remarkably so for financial regulations. Importantly, almost all of the complexity has to do with the exceptions from the general prohibitions that were included at the insistence of the banks.
 
The Rule establishes a series of exclusions from the proprietary trading ban. Several are based on asset class assumed to be less risky, such as US treasury obligations and municipal bonds. The others relate to bank activities to maintain liquidity, such as repurchase agreements (“repos”) and securities and derivatives specifically held to maintain liquidity. The need for these liquidity exclusions is questionable: if the positions are held for liquidity purposes they are not held to profit from short-term price swings. Therefore, they do not constitute proprietary trading and need not be specifically excluded. Presumably, the regulators sought to provide certainty to the banks, but the exclusions are likely invitations to game the rules.
Certain types of asset-backed securities vehicles fall within the Investment Company Act rules used to define the scope of hedge and private equity funds. The Dodd-Frank Act provision expresses an intent to preserve activity in the asset-backed securities market, so pools of mortgages or other loans that fall under the definition are excluded.
 
The statute and the proposed rules carve out specific exceptions and the two most controversial ones are for “market making” and “hedging.” It should be noted that the precondition is that the market making and hedging activity is proprietary trading in the first instance. Then the exception kicks in.
 
Traditionally, markets are venues in which buyers and sellers are matched and transactions executed based on agreed terms, such as product (e.g., common shares of Apple), price, and quantity. The market participants typically can see offers to buy at one price and offers to sell at another. (If there is an offer to buy and an offer to sell at the same price, there is a match and the trade is consummated.) The buy price is the “bid” and the sell price is the “ask.”
A market maker is a financial entity that simultaneously posts both bid and ask prices, intending to profit from the spread between the two. For instance, it will often buy from an investor at the bid price and sell immediately at the ask price. Market makers typically hold inventories to support the business by assuring continuous flow. Thus if the market maker sells shares from its inventory, it may well cover the sale by buying shares on the market and replenishing its inventory. It is a low-risk, low-profit business that provides reliable access to the market for investment bank customers.
The market making exception to the Volcker Rule raises some difficult issues. The traditional market making activity can be manipulated so that a bank is actually profiting (and risking a loss) from price swings for its own account, as opposed to facilitating trades for customers. For example, a bank could quote a bid or ask price that is well off the market. It could establish positions and not close them out promptly for the spread. And, perhaps of the greatest concern, the purported market maker could maintain substantially higher inventory than is sensible for the business flow. These manipulations of the definition have become commonplace on Wall Street. Detecting such a manipulation requires methods of monitoring the individual areas of market making in a bank.
There is one other major issue with Volcker Rule exceptions. Many derivative contracts do not have an associated traditional marketplace. There are no continuously quoted bid and ask prices. Therefore, if a bank transacts such a derivative with a customer who wants the position, there is no objectively discernible price at which the bank can close out the position. The question then arises whether such an activity is market making or simply taking on a risk position.
Many who favor more prudent rules have observed that Congress excepted market making because it was relatively less risky. They have argued for a more restricted reading of the term. In reformers’ view, the test should be whether the bank can reasonably assess the financial outcome of the market making transaction based on objective information, that is to say actual contemporaneous transactions that provide price data for reversing the position.
 
The proposed rules require banks to adopt and comply with written operational guidelines that define their market making businesses consistently with the rules. They also require compensation guidelines that are consistent with the low-profit, low-risk business of market making, not with the high-gain, high-risk business of proprietary trading. One of the requirements to which banks have objected is the provision that banks run and report specific calculations designed to set off alarms if the revenues or inventory levels from a purported market making business are inconsistent with market making. The complaint that these calculations are burdensome is not persuasive.
If a bank has designated a desk (or group of traders) to engage in market making for a given class of securities or derivatives, the bank should monitor the activity of the desk to make certain that it is not exceeding its mandate. In other words, the bank should be running the revenue and inventory calculations required under the proposed rules to protect itself. It is probable that almost all banks do monitor their desks this way and are simply complaining in an attempt to avoid the risk that they might be held accountable to regulators at some later date. But if they are not running these analytics, they should be.
 
The Dodd-Frank act specifies that risk-reducing hedges should be allowed. The question is: what is risk reducing?
Every position involves the risk of a price change. Sometimes this is straight-forward and sometimes it is not. For instance, holding 100 shares of Acme, Inc. that is currently trading at $50/share exposes a bank to the risk that the price goes to $40. But if one holds an option to purchase Apple shares at $45 when the price is at $50, there is risk that the price drops to $45, but no risk of the price dropping further.1 The risks of the two positions have common characteristics, but they are not the same.
The controversy concerns imperfect hedging, or a position that diminishes risk but has further implications. Those who are proponents of more prudent regulations have argued for “congruency.” The Volcker Rule appears to adopt this approach. Here is an example that explains the concept in the context of the natural gas market:
The gas market is based on pipeline hubs from which natural gas is transported in spokes. The primary natural gas hub is called the Henry Hub. The price of gas at the Henry Hub is widely known. The price at the end of a spoke from the Henry Hub, say a delivery point in Houston, is equal to the Henry Hub price plus the cost of transmission to the point of delivery.
Assume the bank has a position that exposes it to natural gas price increases in Houston. This of course must fall into some exception from the proprietary trading ban to be permissible. The risk can be thought of as the risk of a rise in the Henry Hub Price (“Negative HH”) plus the risk of a rise in transmission cost to Houston (“Negative Houston Transmission”). If the bank puts on a position that benefits from a price rise at Henry Hub (“Positive HH”), a portion of the risk of the original position that exposes the bank to price rises at Houston is offset. This can be depicted as follows:
(Negative HH + Negative Houston Transmission) + (Positive HH) = Negative Houston Transmission
This is a straightforwardly risk-reducing hedge. The remainder risk, Negative Houston Transmission, was held by the bank before the offsetting Positive HH position, the hedge, was entered into. The original risk (that qualified under some exception to the proprietary trading ban) was reduced, albeit incompletely. And no risk was added.
But assume that the bank held a position that benefitted from a rise in Henry Hub prices (and therefore exposed the bank to the risk of a fall in prices at Henry Hub). Would a purported hedge using a Houston position that exposed the bank to the risk of rising prices in Houston be permitted as a hedge? It would work this way:
(Positive HH) + (Negative HH + Negative Houston Transmission) = Negative Houston Transmission
In this case the remainder risk was not an element of the initial position. It constitutes an entirely new position in Houston transmission costs and this position has no Volcker Rule exception to rely on, such as market making.
Congruity means that the new position must not expose the bank to risks that were not in the original position. The proposed rules require this, but there is much push back from the banks. The outcome is tremendously important. The example above is very simple, but the relationships between derivatives can be extraordinarily complex. The business activity that the banks describe as hedging is wildly complicated and the risks that are generated from “hedging” are particularly problematic because they are arcane and virtually impossible to value.
 
The statutory language says that hedges must reduce the risk of contracts, holdings or positions. Many banks have engaged in trading that they describe as “portfolio hedging:"" hedging risks that they have not yet taken. They claim that they are hedging in a general sense based on risks they may be exposed to in the future. The JP Morgan Chase “London Whale” claimed to be portfolio hedging when he lost over $6 billion in trades.
The proposed rules indicate that the risks to be hedged must be specific and identified, but the language is unclear. This is why JP Morgan Chase lobbyists initially took the position that the London Whale proprietary trades would have been permitted under the Volcker Rule.",research

Demos, a national non-partisan, non-profit policy research organization, strongly disapproves of the following pieces of legislation that are scheduled for a vote on the House floor in the next few days, H.R. 3010, The Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA); H.R. 527, the Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act and H.R. 10, Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act.  If passed, each of these pieces of legislation would destabilize a regulatory system that saves lives and improves our nation. A vote for them is a vote against clean air and water, against safe food and consumer products, against safe workplaces, and against an accountable, stable financial system. It is no overstatement to conclude that this legislation would cost American lives. 
Dēmos has published studies on the benefits of public safeguards to our economy and our society in numerous publications, including: 
Good Rules: Ten Stories of Successful Regulation, which documents an under-appreciated lesson of our national experience: that good rules and effective enforcement are within our power to achieve. It includes ten vivid stories of daunting health, safety, and environmental problems overcome by acts of federal, state, and local rule-making; of measures that have saved lives, prevented sickness, empowered workers and consumers, spurred innovation, and advanced the common good. 
The Cost of Regulatory Delay, published with the Coalition for Sensible Safeguards, which offers vivid numbers to quantify the costs of not regulating – such as 100 preventable American deaths per year due to contaminated food. The proposed legislation would add even longer delays before essential regulations are issued—often at substantial cost in lives and monetary costs to industry and the public. 
Port Trucking Down the Low Road: A Sad Story of Deregulation, which examines the effects of deregulation on the port trucking industry, which has been a cause of waste, illness, high costs, environmental blight, and bad working conditions. 
Flying Blind: Airline Deregulation Reconsidered, which links the acute troubles of U.S. airlines and their workers back to the decision, three decades ago, to lift most federal regulation of air travel. 
In its recent letter to the House Judiciary Committee on the RAA, the American Bar Association (ABA) Section of Administrative Law and Regulatory Practice, the most authoritative experts in this area, wrote “[f]or some two decades, many administrative lawyers have voiced concerns about the increasing complexity of rulemaking and have been urging Congress not to add unnecessary analytical requirements to the APA rulemaking process.” Rather than addressing these fundamental concerns, the RAA does exactly what the ABA warned against by adding more than 60 new analytical requirements to the Administrative Procedure Act, including mandating agencies to make nearly impossible determinations such as the “indirect costs” or the “cumulative costs and benefits” of a proposed regulation. In addition, this legislation would replace the flexibility of agency decision-making, long a virtue of the regulatory process, with a “one size fits all” approach that forces agencies to adopt the “least costly” regulation for businesses, even if this results in fewer health and safety benefits to the public. 
The RAA goes far beyond what Presidents have required in their Executive Orders on rulemaking by making the lowest cost criteria the primary grounds for agency decision-making. This is a profound change that overrides 25 existing statutes, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Occupational Safety and Health Act, designed to prioritize public health and safety while taking into account costs to regulated entities. 
The RAA will also significantly delay or entirely shut down our government’s ability to produce “major” or “high-impact” rules that typically provide our society with the most health and safety benefits. The bill imposes use of formal rulemaking for both categories of rules, defying a strong consensus among regulatory process experts that “the APA formal rulemaking procedure is obsolete” because previous experience has “shown that it leads to substantial delays.” The RAA exacerbates the current problems in the regulatory process in every way. 
Dēmos urges you to support the public interest, and vote no on HR 3010, HR 527 and HR 10.

"What The Facebook IPO Really Says About America's Economy
Is the Facebook initial public offering – one of the largest IPOs in history – a symbol of American prosperity? In some sense, yes. A technological innovation that began as an extracurricular obsession of a brilliant college student has now become a global “social utility” with 900 million users. In important ways, Facebook has transformed how people interact with each other and demonstrated yet again the dominance of American ingenuity.
And yet, Facebook’s success also dramatically illustrates deeply troubling problems with the U.S. economy that threaten core American values. Six troubling features of the Facebook IPO stand out:
Facebook’s IPO will contribute to the extreme concentration of wealth. As a result of the IPO, CEO Mark Zuckerberg will have a net worth greater than the combined bottom fifth of all U.S. households. Facebook’s founders and investors have scored historic gains in recent years even as most U.S. households have been flat and their wealth assets have declined.  
Facebook has a far smaller number of employees than any company of comparable value. Facebook’s high valuation and relatively tiny labor force shows that building successful companies no longer necessarily means creating many jobs that grow the middle class.
Beyond its founders, early employers, and family members, the biggest winners from Facebook’s IPO will be well-connected insider investors who parlayed their wealth and contacts into a piece of Facebook equity – a common story in today’s unequal economy. Ordinary investors have been largely excluded from this opportunity.  
While Facebook’s founders and key employees have displayed tremendous creativity and vision, many of those getting fabulously rich have not demonstrated outstanding skills and simply happened to be in the right place at the right time. The IPO showcases a “lottery economy,” where there is a growing disconnect between wealth and merit, with individuals reaping outsized gains from pure luck.
While Mark Zuckerberg’s large tax bill has drawn much attention, Facebook will get a huge tax deduction thanks to the stock-option loophole. In addition, some of the company’s largest shareholders have moved to shelter some of their gains from estate and gift taxes. Most egregiously, Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin renounced his U.S. citizenship earlier this year, a move that will save him hundreds of millions in taxes.
The new wealth created by the IPO will empower Facebook stockholders to exercise significant sway over American politics, policy, and culture through campaign donations and philanthropy – further tilting influence over U.S. life to wealthy elites and exacerbating civic inequality.
This report explores each of these concerns. Our goal is not to disparage or demean the success of an important company that has created a service enjoyed by millions. Nor is it to question the right of successful entrepreneurs and investors to become extremely wealthy. Rather, we seek to draw attention to the dangerous ways in which even the most spectacular business breakthroughs do not always translate into gains for ordinary Americans – and, in fact, can reduce the relative influence of such Americans over the direction of U.S. society and generate strong doubts, if not outright cynicism, about whether the social contract works any longer in America.
 
If Facebook is worth around $100 billion as a result of its IPO, a number of its shareholders will become billionaires and multi-millionaires – putting vast new wealth into a handful of individuals associated with the company. Mark Zuckerberg – who owns a 28.4 stake in the company will be worth as much as $25 billion, making the 28-year-old CEO among the top ten richest Americans. Facebook co-founders Dustin Moskovitz and Eduardo Saverin will be worth over $7 billion and $4 billion respectively, and other billionaires will also be created from the IPO, including Sheryl Sandberg, the company’s Chief Operating Officer.
This explosion of new wealth must be understood in the context of broader wealth distribution. The wealthiest 1 percent current holds about 35 percent of all U.S. household wealth, according to an analysis by economist Edward Wolff, while the top 20 percent of households has about 85 percent of all wealth. According to study last year by the Pew Research Center, about a third of black (35%) and Hispanic (31%) households had zero or negative net worth in 2009. In addition, 15 percent of all white households had zero or negative net worth. 
Extrapolating from Census data on the number of households in each demographic group, Mark Zuckerberg had a higher net worth than 21,468,489 of the poorest households in America – or nearly a fifth of all U.S. households. And given the low wealth holdings among many Americans who do have assets – Latino and African-Americans households have a median net worth of $6,325 and $5,677 respectively – it appears that Zuckerberg is worth more than the bottom quarter of all U.S. households.
It would be one thing if the vast new Facebook fortunes were being minted during prosperous times and amid an overall increase in U.S. household wealth. But this is not the case. Many Americans have suffered devastating declines in their wealth during recent years: As the Pew study reports, “the median wealth, or net worth, of U.S. households fell from $96,894 in 2005 to $70,000 in 2009, a drop of 28 percent. Black and Latino households lost over half of their net worth during this period on average.” The percentage of U.S. households with zero or negative net worth is now at the highest level in a quarter century.
Facebook and its founders are not responsible for growing inequality and the economic hardship endured by millions of Americans. But it’s notable and troubling that one of America’s fastest growing sectors, technology, tends to concentrate huge winnings in the hands of so few. Indeed, studies show that inequality is closely linked to the rise of the tech sector. Between 1994 and 2000, for example, just five counties in the U.S. contributed disproportionately to the rise in income inequality over this period: New York, New York; Santa Clara, California; San Mateo, California; King, Washington (home of Seattle and Redmond); and San Francisco, California. Four of these counties are well known for their robust tech sectors.
In a more recent analysis, Richard Florida found that the counties with the greatest amount of inequality are those with strong high-tech industries. The top five most unequal counties in the U.S., according this study, are: Huntsville, Alabama (a capital for semi-conductor research and industry); San Jose, California (again, Silicon Valley); College Station-Bryan, Texas; Boulder, Colorado (recently named the number-one place for new start-ups); and Durham, North Carolina (home of the research Triangle).
The recent success of the tech sector, and the Facebook IPO, shouldn’t be confused with the broader success of U.S. households. There is no rising wealth tide lifting the boats of all Americans. A great many boats, in fact, are under water. Nevertheless, the biggest yachts in the nation are rising in breathtaking ways.
 
Technology companies deliver amazing products and services, and Facebook is a prime example of how breakthroughs in the tech sector can change how we live. But what the tech sector does not reliably deliver are many jobs compared to revenues and profits. Facebook illustrates this reality. Even as the company has become spectacularly successful, and vastly enriched individuals associated with it, it has generated relatively few jobs.
Facebook added just over 1,000 jobs in 2011, bringing its total work force to 3,200 employees. Indirectly, through the apps and other subsidiary components supported by Facebook, the company is estimated to have created between 53,000 and 129,000 jobs in the United States.
Even if Facebook doubles or triples its labor force with the new investment capital it raises from the IPO, it will employ vastly fewer people than any other U.S. corporation of a similar value in the range of $100 billion. For example, PepsiCo has 285,000 employees with a market value of $103 billion, according to Fortune. Abbott Laboratories employs 91,000 people with a market value of $95.6 billion. Walt Disney has 156,000 employees with a market value of $77 billion. Bank of America, with a market value of $102 billion has 284,000 employees.
Facebook also has many fewer employees than older technology and Internet companies, showing how a new generation of tech firms may be able to generate greater wealth without large labor forces. Amazon has 56,200 employees and market value of $93.1 billion. Cisco has 71,000 employees and a market cap of $113 billion. Intel has 101,000 employees with a market cap of $114.6 billion.
Facebook’s high valuation on the NASDAQ also speaks to a larger disconnect between corporate profits, stock prices, and the labor market during the post-recession recovery. According to a recent analysis from Northeastern University, in the first two years of the recovery, the Dow Jones Industrial average increased 49 percent, the Standard and Poor 500 index had increased 46 percent, yet real mean hourly earnings of all private sector workers had decreased 1 percent. Put a different way, recent years have been fantastic for owners of capital – who are largely part of the top 20 percent of households, as noted – and terrible for workers.
 
Nearly three quarters of Americans believe the “rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer,” accord to a Harris Interactive poll taken last year. The Facebook IPO confirms at least half of this view: it will shower vast new wealth on investors who were only able to get a stake in Facebook because they were already wealthy and had inside connections.
Investors who support start-ups with capital play a crucial role in spurring growth and creating jobs. These investors often take big risks and deserve big rewards. But the ability of those with wealth and connections to achieve even greater wealth, through opportunities not available to the rest of us, illustrates how the U.S. economy delivers outsized gains to existing “haves,” exacerbating the wealth divide.
Beyond its founders and first employees, the biggest winners from Facebook’s IPO will be its early investors – most of whom were wealthy Silicon Valley insiders even before they invested in Facebook and only got an opportunity to invest in Facebook because of their connections and existing wealth. These winners include Peter Thiel, who owns 2.5 percent of the company, according to Facebook’s registration statement to the SEC. Thiel was already extremely wealthy in his role in founding PayPal and a hedge fund when he became the first major outside investor to Facebook, writing a check for $500,000 after a meeting with Zuckerberg. Thiel met Zuckerberg through his connections with Reid Hoffman, another wealthy PayPal co-founder who knew Sean Parker, the company’s president. (Hoffman secured a 0.5 percent stake in Facebook.) Another major winner is Jim Breyer and the venture capital firm of Accel Partners, which owns 10 percent of the company worth as much as $10 billion. Breyer not only arranged the Accel investment, but – thanks to his personal wealth and proximity to the deal – was able to invest his own money in the company, which is now a 0.6 percent stake worth $600 million.  
While most of those getting rich from Facebook did not start with family wealth, such wealth did play a key role in both launching the company and enriching one of the biggest winners in the Facebook story: 29-year old co-founder Eduardo Saverin. The son of a wealthy Brazilian industrialist, Saverin had the means as a college student to help bankroll Facebook’s startup, becoming its first investor and helping Facebook afford server space and other early costs. Saverin, who played no role in the company after its earliest days, is now worth some $4 billion thanks to his Facebook holdings.
Well-connected investors who didn’t get in on Facebook in the early days may still have a chance to do very well as the result of IPO. While the first sale of Facebook’s stock is called an initial public offering, and the company has pledged to give ordinary investors a shot at buying shares early on, few in the broader investing public have any chance of getting in on this action. Instead, those with the best chance to buy shares at their initial offering price will be financial advisors and investors closely connected to the Wall Street firms underwriting the IPO. As the New York Times’ Dealbook reported: “Depending on the size of the offering, Facebook will end up paying more than $100 million in fees to the underwriters. The firms that receive the most in underwriting fees typically get the biggest number of retail shares. In the case of Facebook, that is likely to be Morgan Stanley, which has a large network of brokers. Those shares are highly coveted and typically go to the firm's top-producing brokers – and their best clients.” In other words, wealthy brokers and well-heeled clients have the biggest chance of being able to buy Facebook shares at their opening price – and reap huge gains if the stock then climbs dramatically in value.
Finally, it is worth mentioning the large gains that Mark Zuckerberg’s family will reap from the public offering. Zuckerberg’s father, who provided family money and other forms of help to Facebook and his son in its early days was granted the option to buy 2 million shares of Facebook stock by the company’s board. He will likely be worth $60 million after the IPO, according to New York magazine. Mark Zuckerberg’s sister, Randi, is also likely to do well from the IPO, since she was hired by her brother as Facebook’s first marketing director with stock options.
 
The free market is supposed to grant its biggest rewards to those with the best ideas, strongest work ethic, or greatest savvy. Parts of the Facebook story confirm this link between wealth and merit – particularly Zuckerberg’s success, given his wide reputation as the visionary behind the company. Other players in the story also clearly earned huge rewards, including Sean Parker who instantly saw the value of Facebook and orchestrated the company’s key early successes in Silicon Valley; and COO Sheryl Sandberg, a Google veteran who played an instrumental role in figuring out how to monetize Facebook.
But the Facebook IPO will also place huge fortunes in the hands of early employees who – very talented though they may be – were mainly in the right place at the right time. While comparably skilled professionals who took jobs at different companies are now earning low-six figure salaries, some of Facebook’s lucky early employees are worth hundreds of millions of dollars, in some cases for just a few years of work. These fortunes more resemble lottery winnings than a rational payout based on effort, boldness, or creativity.
Four former or current Facebook employees are now estimated to each hold 0.8 percent of equity in the company, worth some $800 million: Matt Choler, a former vice president of product management; Jeff Rothschild, a computer scientist who worked with Facebook on its early data management; Adam D’Angelo, an early chief technology officer for the company; an early chief operating officer.  
Others who will win big from the IPO include employees who came in well after the company’s founding when it was well on its path to huge success. These include chief financial officer David Ebersman, $400 million, hired in 2009; vice president for engineering Mike Schroepfer, $370 million, hired in 2008; and general counsel Theodore Ullyot, $370 million, hired in 2008.
David Choe is perhaps the most famous case of winning the Facebook lottery. As reported by the New York Times, Choe was hired to create murals in Facebook’s offices in Silicon Valley and chose to be paid in stock rather than case. His personal fortune from Facebook stock is now estimated at $200 million.
Of course, there may be no Facebook multi-millionaires who have done less to earn their wealth than Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who played no role in building the company but successfully sued Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg for allegedly stealing their idea. Their combined fortune from Facebook stock is estimated at over $40 million.
 
Much has been made of the large tax bill that Mark Zuckerberg will pay to the U.S. Treasury and State of California when Facebook goes public. According to an analysis by PrivCo, Zuckerberg is likely to pay $714 million to the IRS and $189 million to California, for a total of $903 million.
Equally significant, though, is how the Facebook IPO showcases the ways that corporations and the wealthy can avoid paying their fair share of taxes. Under current tax law, Facebook can utilize a controversial tax loophole to claim a huge tax deduction, get a large refund from the federal government for past taxes paid, and greatly reduce its future tax bills. As well, Facebook’s founders and key shareholders are exploiting other loopholes to lower their tax bills.
For nearly 15 years, Senator Carl Levin and other lawmakers have been trying to close the so-called “stock-option” loophole. This tax break allows corporations to hand out abundant stock options and yet claim that those options are worth very little money in reporting their expenses and profits to shareholders – thereby improving their bottom line. But when employees exercise such options, corporations are allowed – under the tax code – to turn around and claim the options are worth full market value. In a speech in Congress in February, Senator Carl Levin noted that this loophole could not only entitle save Facebook to a refund of $500 million on previously paid taxes but result in “a tax break of up to $3 billion” in future years. As the largest stockholder in Facebook, Zuckerberg will directly benefit from these tax savings, with his eventual gains helping offset his large up-front tax bill that has attracted such attention.
In addition to exploiting the stock-option loophole, several Facebook founders or investors have reportedly set up grantor-retained annuity trust, or GRATs, to avoid paying estate and gift taxes on some of their new wealth. As reported by the Wall Street Journal, those creating GRATs with Facebook shares in recent years include Dustin Moskovitz, Sean Parker, Sheryl Sandberg, Reid Hoffman, and Zuckerberg. GRATs are complex, but basically these vehicles will allow Facebook shareholders to allow some of their shares to appreciate in value and yet not have that appreciation subject to future estate taxes. According to the Wall Street Journal, the GRATs created so far by Facebook shareholders will allow their heirs or beneficiaries to avoid $200 million in taxes.
Finally, and most egregiously, is how Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin renounced his U.S. citizenship earlier this year, a move that will allow him to save hundreds of millions of dollars in capital gains taxes. Saverin now lives in Singapore, which doesn’t have a capital gains tax. Of course, though, Saverin did not get rich in Singapore: he got rich in America, a society with strong public structures that facilitate wealth creation and are paid for by tax dollars. Saverin met Mark Zuckerberg at Harvard, an institution partly subsidized by federal grants and got rich using the Internet, a technology invented by a U.S. government agency. Facebook has prospered in Silicon Valley, a tech region spawned in part by early U.S. government military and science spending, and in the United States, a country with strong intellectual property rights and other legal protections for entrepreneurs. As well, many of Facebook’s employees were educated at public schools and universities.
Saverin is not alone among wealthy individuals who have gotten rich with the help of American public structures and then renounced U.S. citizenship. For some of the super wealthy, it turns out, money comes before loyalty.
 
Much of the wealth generated by Facebook may never be taxed at all because it will be donated to charity. Mark Zuckerberg has pledged to give away at least half of his wealth, as part of The Giving Pledge organized by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. Zuckerberg has already begun giving away his money, most notably with a major gift to improve public schools in Newark. Co-founder Dustin Moskovitz has also pledged to give away at least half of his fortune.
The American tradition of philanthropy has yielded many positive benefits to the U.S. and to humanity, and the new philanthropists minted by Facebook are sure to do much good with their money. But a cautionary note is also in order as these vast new philanthropic fortunes come online: Philanthropy allows private individuals to use money sheltered from taxation to advance their own personal agenda for public policy, culture, science, and so on, and to exercise vastly more influence over society than ordinary citizens or voters can. In other words, all taxpayers are subsidizing the ability of the super wealthy to try to shape America or the world as they see fit.
Mark Zuckerberg’s gift to improve Newark’s schools shows the benefits and dangers of how the new wealth created by Facebook will be deployed in the public sphere. On the one hand, it’s positive that Zuckerberg is trying to help one of the poorest and most troubled school districts in America. On the other hand, the large size of the donation – $100 million, before matching gifts – cannot help but help shape the direction of school policy in Newark, which should more rightly be decided by the citizens of Newark. Education has traditionally been among the most democratic areas of American life. But that has changed in recent years as the result of large-scale philanthropy by donors like Bill Gates and Eli Broad, with these private individuals profoundly influencing public schools. Zuckerberg’s entry into this activity could exacerbate a troubling trend whereby ordinary citizens have diminished influence over crucial policy questions relative to wealthy philanthropists.
Facebook’s IPO will also put considerable political power in the hands of its shareholders, if the trajectory of other tech companies is any indication. Prior to Google’s IPO in 2004, its employees gave little money to political candidates. Such giving jumped dramatically after Google went public and its employees were among the top five groups bankrolling President Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign, ultimately giving Obama $814,540 according to OpenSecrets.org. (Google employees are again among the top five groups giving to Obama in the current election cycle.)
Facebook employees and directors are already using their wealth to try to influence electoral outcomes – donating $459,251 to candidates and party committees over the past three election cycles. COO Sheryl Sandberg alone has given $108,000. In short, the wealth of Facebook shareholders will allow them to have a much bigger say in U.S. politics than is available to most Americans, subverting the egalitarian ideal that lies at the heart of America’s democracy.
Finally, Facebook can be expected to use some of the new funds raised by its IPO to expand its lobbying and PAC activity. The company’s spending on lobbying rose from $207,878 in 2009 to $1,350,000 in 2012. It is sure to increase further in coming years.
Facebook is a great success story in many ways. Thanks to the vision and creativity of the company’s founders and investors, people worldwide can share better information and stay in contact. Those who helped create Facebook rightly deserve big rewards. But the vast size of these rewards amid high inequality and widespread hardship raises troubling questions about how well the U.S. economy is working. If such new riches came during prosperous times from a company that created a large number of good jobs, that would be one thing. But this is not the case. And the ability of the company and its founders to exploit tax loopholes raises additional fairness concerns, as does the outsized influence that Facebook shareholders are likely to wield in U.S. politics and philanthropy.
Facebook founders have not done anything wrong or immoral, with the exception of Eduardo Saverin. But they are operating in a society that advantages corporations and the wealthy at nearly every turn, pushing tax burdens onto Americans of more modest means while also diminishing the civic voice of ordinary citizens. For these reasons, Facebook’s IPO should be less a cause of celebration, than an alarm bell drawing attention to how America has become dangerously tilted in favor of the rich and powerful. ",policy-briefs
"The Financial Infrastructure Exchange (FIX) is a federal tax-and-subsidy program to promote long-term investment in a financial system that otherwise prioritizes short-term gains. Funded by a financial transactions tax (FTT) on a spectrum of short-term trading activities, FIX revenues empower institutional investors—like pension funds, individual retirement accounts, or college endowments—to shift their allocation of capital toward much-needed, longer-term investments, including investments in next generation infrastructures for sustainability needs. By leveraging such investment, the FIX can also be the cornerstone for new large-scale job creation in an era of diminishing employment opportunities in the private sector and in many or our communities—particularly in communities of color, which were hardest hit by the Wall Street crisis and the Great Recession.
The FIX is predicated on the idea that the financial system is badly misaligned with the need to meet pressing twenty-first century economic, environmental, and social challenges. In particular, the FIX provides a remedy for the problem of financial models that value short-term price and liquidity higher than long-term value creation. This and related phenomena are often referred to as financial “short-termism.” 
Financial short-termism—a product, ultimately, of the shortened time-scales used to measure the value of investments—burdens our infrastructure development, particularly for sustainability needs. This is mainly a consequence of the hyper-valuation of continuous liquidity (the ability to liquidate or acquire investments at a moment’s notice and at a discernable and reliable price). While liquidity is important, it is not the only factor that investors should value, though it is one of the easiest to measure. Because of this ease of measurement and because continuous liquidity serves its interest, the financial sector has emphasized it. As a consequence, longer time-scale benefits are devalued and the long-term needs of society are starved of capital. By realigning capital flows within the financial system, the FIX provides a plausible alternative to short-termism. It would allow institutional investors to support infrastructure and sustainability projects, and, in so doing, build momentum toward a more inclusive and resilient economy.
The FIX will be structured as follows: Revenues from a targeted set of financial transactions taxes will be placed in one or more public trusts with the fiduciary purpose of incenting pension funds, retirement accounts, and other large pools of public and private capital to invest in infrastructure, new technologies, environmental needs, education, and other social goods with long-term value. There could be a single federal trust that pays out subsidies to qualifying investors in projects that are brought forward by state or regional entities. Alternatively, there could be state and regional trusts established by state governments to pay out investment subsidies for projects within their jurisdictions. In that case, the trust funds could be administered by existing development or financing agencies previously established under state law.
Essentially, the FIX subsidies will be used to offset perceived liquidity costs of long-term investments. As a result, more institutional capital will be made available for such investment because it will be competitive with more liquid alternatives. Importantly, the FIX’s reliance on an FTT will not impose net costs on middle- and lower-income savers or retirees, because the revenue is channeled directly to institutional investors. 
Directing subsidies to investors, rather than project sponsors or new companies (“sponsors”), is a critical feature of FIX. While obviously this benefits sponsors who are enabled to raise financing for their undertakings, directing subsidy to investors has a number of benefits. First, the sponsors must demonstrate to institutional investors that they are good credits with reasonable business plans. Government is not responsible for picking winners and losers and pricing enterprise value. Also, if the sponsor fails, the investors take a loss. A portion, but not all, of the subsidy may be lost. Thus, the subsidy is earned over time.
Importantly, the FIX design can and should have a decentralized governance structure to assess project choices, requiring ongoing community involvement in both the determination and prioritization of qualified investments and in setting workforce standards in connection with FIX-subsidized investments. Thus, the FIX is not only a large-scale infrastructure finance policy; it is also a new and potentially game-changing platform for inclusive economic development. 
The FIX is also, plainly, a financial reform policy, aiming to curb harmful financial activities linked to volatility and asset bubbles. In this respect, predictable criticism will arise from supporters of the status quo, who argue that such taxation will restrict financial liquidity and consequently increase the cost of capital funding. However, any market liquidity costs experienced by investors will be more than offset by the investors’ enhanced returns on long-term assets and by improvements in macroeconomic performance linked to the growth in these assets.
Moreover, by directing the revenues to investors, it will constitute an alteration of investment patterns without having an impact on the federal budget and without being dependent on congressional appropriations. The tax revenues will be devoted exclusively to the FIX and will not pass through the budget. If the tax revenues are not sufficient, the recipients of the subsidy, the investors, will receive less subsidy. In fact, the FIX is designed to generate budget benefits for at least two reasons. It will increase economic activity by increasing investment, thereby lifting incomes and tax revenues. In addition, to the extent that the FIX is used in lieu of conventional tax expenditures for the exemption of state and local bond interest from taxation, there would be a budgetary benefit.
 
The United States suffers from significant underinvestment in infrastructure and other broadly beneficial capital uses (“Sustainability Investments”), a condition that has deteriorated even further with the fiscal austerity of recent years. We have estimated that the deficit for clean energy and infrastructure alone is in the range of, at a minimum, $400 billion per year, measured by the goal of not falling further behind. This investment deficit is a major concern for the long-term health of our economy and for societal well-being in a time when collective needs and risks are growing in our society. Moreover, it is a foregone opportunity for substantial job creation in an economy with a shrinking supply of good jobs in the private sector and diminishing effective demand in the overall economy. Substantial sustainability investments will directly generate large numbers of secure and well-paying jobs while improving societal well-being and restoring infrastructural competitive advantages for our economy as a whole. 
The FIX funding proposal balances the investment misallocations because the financial activity to be taxed is causally related to the investment deficit. Structural change of the capital allocation process has been a major contributing factor, as traded capital markets and managed investments such as hedge funds have come to dwarf commercial lending and consumer credit markets. The primary benefit of the trading markets is that they provide better liquidity for investors, either through direct investments or indirectly via hedge funds and mutual funds. With efficiently functioning and active trading in secondary markets (meaning markets in previously issued securities and derivatives), investors have the opportunity to liquidate investment positions at predictable and transparent prices. Investors pay a premium for this liquidity by lowering their required return on investment, and this can benefit businesses, governments, and households that rely on capital funding by lowering capital cost. 
However, the liquidity premium is largely derived from values that affect price over short time scales. The value of sustainability investments, on the other hand, is realized over much longer time scales, and, because of this, as well as the non-excludability of benefits in many cases, the values appear less certain. It is difficult to translate these values into short-term prices because they occur so far in the future and are relatively uncertain and diffuse. Thus, sustainability investment funding is burdened by being relatively ill-suited to investment sources in the existing market structure. The long-term benefits of sustainability investments are simply not valued in a financial system increasingly dominated by short-term trading activities and related trading technologies. In the existing market structure, mismatches between sources and uses of capital are often reconciled by derivatives intermediated by the financial sector. This form of intermediation is generally not available for sustainability investments and, as a consequence, investment in sustainability has been sporadic and unreliable.
The FIX is not intended to eliminate the accessibility of the benefits of short-term liquidity to investors. Instead, it is designed to rebalance investment toward assets and goods with longer-term valuations and returns, linked to sustainability. By tying the subsidy to sustainability investments, the proposal will shift capital allocation by major long-term investment pools toward purposes that will benefit the economy and increase the wellbeing of the public for many decades to come. Under the FIX, capital reallocation to long-term assets will benefit investors, rather than burden them. Thus, aggregate capital costs to businesses, government, and households will not increase, but the use of capital will be reprioritized in favor of sustainability. The failure of the private capital markets to fund these projects because of the rise of capital intermediation through traded markets will be remedied or at least mitigated.
Moreover, many sustainability investments (in particular, infrastructure) are subsidized by a grant of tax exemption of the interest on state and municipal debt. Using that form of subsidy narrows the categories of investors who are likely to invest in that debt. Investors who do not pay income taxes on current interest earnings cannot transmit the subsidy to the state and local debt issuers because the tax exemption is valueless to them. Longer-term investors who do not pay taxes, such as retirement funds and endowments of non-profits, are not appropriate buyers of tax-exempt debt. Instead, investors such as money market mutual funds, for whom the liquidity premium is extremely important, are prominent investors in tax-exempt debt. Banks often provide extraordinary levels of liquidity for tax-exempt debt through complex interest rate swaps and standby purchase credit facilities, a costly and risky alternative that absorbs much of the subsidy. The FIX will open up vast pools of capital to state and local governments with less risky financial structures while compensating them for the loss of the federal tax exemption, lowering the overall cost of capital to these governments.
Finally, in the face of likely fiscal constraints on discretionary spending in the coming decades, the FIX promises a new pathway for revitalizing public investment in foundational assets and collective needs. The FIX design of leveraging private capital investment with subsidies underwritten by a financial transactions tax is not only fiscally neutral but, in fact, is likely to be deficit-reducing due to long-run growth effects associated with sustainability investments. 
 
We propose a program to reconcile the needs of long-term investors with the value profile of sustainability investments. The program is not intended to provide direct subsidies to sustainability projects but instead will encourage private investment in such projects.
The policy is designed around four structural elements: (1) The types of investment to be incented; (2) The mechanism for delivering the subsidy; (3) The type of charge to be levied against financial transactions and the potential annual revenue from the charge; and (4) The target investors who will benefit directly from the subsidy.
The proposal is designed to increase reliable and sensible investment in activities that enhance the sustainability of the US economy and the well-being of households. The following classes of investments will be included:
Within these categories, the FIX envisions criteria that would establish priorities for application of the subsidy based on regional needs as well as broad, nationwide benefits. As a result, channels of regional input will be needed as well as a methodology for assessing demand across regions, discussed below.
Each endeavor to be financed will involve returns to investors as well as public benefits. These direct and indirect returns on investment must be taken into consideration. There are several types of returns that must be addressed:
In many cases, the subsidy valuation will require analytics similar to those used for social impact bonds. It is this value that must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. In the ideal structure, all communities will derive similar levels of benefit reflected by the subsidy. This will probably be elusive. However, individual regions will need to have fair opportunities to put forward proposals. Broader benefits will be in at least three forms:
The amount of the subsidy will be based on the form of the investment and the amount needed to provide reasonable assurance that the investment can be funded in the market. The subsidy amount will be capped at a percentage (perhaps 50%) of the benefits that are estimated to accrue to the public from the implementation of the investment, other than the direct benefits to users from use of the assets and activities funded. For example, a wastewater treatment facility would benefit the users of the wastewater system by providing for the disposition of wastewater in a safe manner in accordance with standards. However, if the facility is developed and implemented so as to use minimal energy and to exceed minimal standards for purity of output, additional benefits to the community, the region, and the nation will be generated. A percentage of these additional benefits will be the cap on the subsidy.
In order to allocate the pool of available subsidy, standards for qualifying investments will be developed, and a mechanism for transfer to investors will need to be in place. One approach is to establish a Sustainability Investment Trust to perform these tasks with independent oversight. The trust will review investment opportunities stemming from detailed criteria that it will publish based on authorizing legislation. The opportunities will be submitted for approval by states and municipalities or regional combinations thereof. The trust will then commit subsidy pending the closing of the financing. Sustainability investment sponsors will be responsible for arranging the financing with investors or through intermediaries.
An alternative, more bottom-up approach would be to administer the program through state sustainability trusts overseen by a federal agency or perhaps by the regional Federal Reserve banks. In this configuration, states could be allocated committed subsidy amounts based on submission of sustainability investment plans to independent review boards. Channels for community input could be considered a requirement for approval and release of funds in this process.
The criteria for qualified investments should include:
There are several possible forms of the subsidy delivery mechanism, to be determined after further study. Two possibilities include:
FIX revenues will be generated by a framework of financial transactions charges imposed against a variety of financial transactions, including the secondary market sales and purchases of shares of stock, the secondary market sales and purchases of bonds, the entry into derivatives contracts in the form of futures, swaps, and options on securities and commodities. Each of these transactions is distinctive so that a simple one-size-fits-all charge based on the size of the transaction is not feasible. We have provided three separate options with differing tax rates for each form of transaction covered (see also Table 1).
The amount of revenue to be raised from any charge against transactions must take into consideration the volume of transactions in the markets and the effect that the imposition of a charge will have on the volume (elasticity). 
Based on work done by the CBO, the IMF, and the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, preliminary revenue potential based on current volumes and three separate options for tax rates are calculated. Because of the low level of the rate, the tax revenue assumes that transaction volumes will not be affected by the tax.

Targeted investors for FIX subsidies include pension funds and individual pension accounts, college and university endowments, and other capital sources. These are long-term pools of money that have predictable cash out-flows. As a result, they can hold onto investments over a long period of time.
These investment pools are targeted for three main reasons: 1) they are large sources of capital; 2) they are dis-incented from investing in infrastructure and other sustainability investments because of the current tax code; and 3) many such as public pension funds and endowments already have nominal commitments to socially-responsible investing.  
A preliminary evaluation of these groups indicates that there are large sums to be tapped.

The investments that are subsidized by the FIX will largely displace investments in the Bonds and Other Asset Classes categories.
The current concept is to initially attract at least $750 billion of investment annually from these sources. The long-range target is between 20 and 30% of the total amount invested in pensions, endowments, and retirement savings currently, or around $6.5 trillion.
These investor groups share a common characteristic: they do not pay income tax on the return earned on investments. The payouts from the pension funds and the retirement accounts are taxed upon dispersal (except to the extent that funds deposited into them are from after-tax income of the beneficiary). Thus, the tax on earnings is deferred. 
However, as described above, many infrastructure undertakings are currently financed with bonds of state and local governments the interest on which is exempt from federal income taxation, an inefficient and costly subsidy. This is not a deferral of tax revenues, and tax is never collected on the investment earnings. This tax exemption is a tax expenditure of the federal government that reduces the interest rates on the state and local bonds because the holders accept a rate that is in the range of 30% lower than it would be if it were taxable. A very large portion of the market for these bonds is made up of relatively high-income individuals that have tax liabilities. The Obama Administration, as well as previous administrations, has tried unsuccessfully to limit or eliminate it in favor of other mechanisms in part because any substitution for the tax expenditure subsidy from tax-exempt interest would be subject to the budget process. The FIX will be outside the budget.
Tapping into the tremendous pool of investors target by the FIX proposal would be very advantageous for sustainability investment. To do so without cost to state and local governments whose alternative is tax-exempt debt would require a subsidy that would replace the incentive provided by tax expenditures. Thus, for investments qualifying for tax-exempt debt, the subsidy would have to include an amount in respect of the value of the tax exemption. For pension funds and retirement accounts, this value would be recaptured by the federal government when beneficiaries draw from the funds. This portion of the subsidy would bear a cost equal to the time value of funds pending tax recoupment when benefits are paid out to pensioners.
 
The FIX is designed to address two major concerns simultaneously: increasingly short-term investment horizons and chronic under-investment in sustainability needs. Table 3 illustrates how its major benefits achieve these goals.

With its social objectives and its alignment with large sources of capital, the FIX has significant potential to unite a stakeholder coalition with the power to overcome opposition to the policy:",research
"On Tuesday, December 13th, the Congressional Progressive Caucus unveiled the RESTORE the American Dream for the 99% Act. The bill, if passed, would create more than 5 million jobs and save more than $2 trillion. This is a comprehensive plan to put America back to work by reversing the failed policies of the past, which the “Super Committee” could not achieve. 
Demos has conducted research on a number of issues – from the benefits of a direct jobs program to protecting Social Security – that are addressed in the RESTORE the American Dream for the 99% Act.

Back To Work: A Public Jobs Proposal For Economic Recovery
This report makes the case that we should create jobs for the unemployed directly and immediately in public employment programs that produce useful goods and services for the public’s benefit. The public sector can directly create jobs quickly, serve vital community needs and target those hurt most in this economy. Projects would generally be undertaken by the federal government and agencies in partnership with local governments and should be guaranteed reasonable pay and benefits. 
 
The Investment Deficit
Panic over our rising national debt receives ample attention in Congress and in the media, and deficit spending is often branded as the greatest threat to our nation's future.  While ignoring our fiscal challenges could undermine our security and economic flexibility, the ongoing lack of investment in American infrastructure and workers has and continues to severely threaten our competitiveness and future economic prosperity.

"Even before the Equifax breach, the integrity of credit reports was murky at best. A Federal Trade Commission report found that as many as one in five consumers had a credit error from one of the top reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion). But the fundamental problem isn’t data integrity—it’s economic justice. According to a survey by the think tank Demos, declining credit was associated more with misfortunes and unforeseeable crises than with a lack of financial responsibility. Suffering an unexpected bout of unemployment or a medical bankruptcy, living with a psychological disability, or being a survivor of intimate-partner abuse can all mar your credit—as can being a person of color (in surveys, whites are more than twice as likely to describe their credit as “excellent”). The factors driving a poor credit rating vary, but they too often include circumstances that should never be a pretext for judging your character or job qualifications.
Despite the lack of evidence showing that employability can be judged by credit history, about one in seven people with poor credit recalled being “advised that they were not being hired because of their credit,” and about 10 percent of the unemployed said their credit had excluded them from a job, according to Demos’s survey research.",media
"It was exactly 75 years ago that Franklin Roosevelt enacted the Social Security program. Created in part to counteract the high rate of poverty among older Americans who had left the workforce, it has proven to be one of the most successful social insurance programs ever developed, providing millions of Americans with the resources they need to survive. Despite its proven fortitude over the last several decades, the impending retirement of the baby boom generation has raised fresh concerns about the program's solvency. A recent poll commissioned by the National Academy for Social Insurance found that 55 percent of Americans do not expect that Social Security will still be paying benefits by the time they retire. Young people were even more doubtful of the program's survival-two-thirds of adults age 18-34 do not expect to receive benefits.
Adding to fears about the program's stability is the heightened public debate over swollen deficits and the trajectory for public debt, as well as the mischaracterization of Social Security as one of the entitlements driving our fiscal imbalances.
However, an objective look at the structural soundness of Social Security and an understanding of the roots of our yawning budget deficit reveal that it is not a dire liability on the federal balance sheet nor is it in any imminent danger of insolvency. Social Security benefit payments are fully funded for decades to come, and under current budget projections, average lifetime benefits are slated to grow higher for each new crop of beneficiaries. Relatively modest tweaks to the program's financing will further strengthen the system for generations to come.",policy-briefs

"While GDP has been steadily increasing, indicating a growing economy, other metrics of progress show a very different picture. 
GDP measures economic growth, but is it an accurate measure of progress?
While GDP has been steadily increasing, indicating a growing economy, other metrics of progress show a very different picture. Demos’ report, Beyond GDP, makes the case for why GDP is an incomplete measure and explains in depth what is missing from GDP that prevents it from measuring progress. Demos is also releasing a set of infographics that charts important social measures against GDP growth. One chart shows how inequality is rising even as GDP is rising, which shows that fewer people are benefitting from the economic growth.
Over the last 30 years, personal income lagged far behind GDP growth, and the gap between them grew steadily. GDP per capita—the amount of income potentially available for every person—more than doubled, while actual income gains were much smaller.    

 
Family income has grown modestly in recent decades, but mainly due to working more, not higher wages—an average of roughly 700 more annual work hours per household in 2000 compared to 1975, and still roughly 500 more in 2009, even with the financial crisis and downturn of that period. This contrasts sharply with the previous pattern from the late nineteenth century through the mid-twentieth century, as growth and productivity gains were channeled into steadily reducing working hours.  

 
Across the last thirty years of steady GDP growth, essentially half of the working age population had no pension coverage beyond Social Security. After a steep decline in the 2000s, the pension coverage rate was approximately 45 percent in 2010, the lowest level since 1988 and 6 percent lower than in 1980.  

 
Growth financed by rising debt, not middle class earnings (which have been relatively flat), may be the defining trend of the economy that ran aground in 2008.  

 
After steep declines in the 1960s, we’ve made little progress in reducing poverty. Today roughly 15 percent of Americans live below the poverty line, the same as in 1968. 

 
The child poverty rate today is actually 8 points higher than in 1969. 

 
The Index of Social Health (developed by the Institute for Innovation in Social Policy at Vassar College) calculates a composite rate of social health based on more than fifteen trends, including infant mortality, child abuse, child poverty, teenage suicide, high school dropout rates, homicides, food insecurity, affordable housing, weekly wages, and income inequality. After a serious decline of roughly 25 points from the mid-1970s through the early 1980s, U.S. social health showed some improvement by the late 1990s, but by 2009 still stood roughly 16 points lower than in 1974. Clearly we need more than growth to promote social progress, and other evidence suggests that, in fact, the kind of highly-unequal growth we’ve had may actually be a driver of social decline in some key areas such as health and education. 

 
Some things did grow faster than the economy. While GDP doubled, the incarceration rate tripled. 

 
The economy may be growing but the benefits are going to fewer people. We’ve had a growth that divides our country instead of uniting us, with negative consequences increasingly evident in other social trends. 
 
 
One of the fatal flaws of GDP is that it does not recognize environmental costs of economic activity, and these costs are often left for society to pay while some costs are passed down to future generations. The United States’ “ecological footprint”—its consumption of resources and burdening of natural waste absorption capacities—is nearly double the average rate found in other advanced countries. From an environmental perspective, U.S. living standards are dangerously inefficient and grossly out of balance with average human needs as reflected in other advanced societies. 
 
Year by year with rising growth, our biocapacity—the availability of resources and waste absorption capacity in a given area—has steadily declined. The environmental equivalent of financing current consumption with our retirement savings, we are spending down our natural wealth at a rate that threatens future well-being, even near-future well-being. 

 
Our heat-trapping carbon emissions are out of control, rising steadily with economic growth. 

 
If GDP leaves so much out, how can we really measure our progress? In fact experts have developed many types of alternative indicators that bring us closer to reality. One is the Genuine Progress Indicator, or GPI, which starts with GDP but adjusts the level growth for as many as 26 factors of household, social, and environmental change. Over the last 50 years, a large and growing gap has emerged between GDP and GPI. Basically, we have expanded our economy without improving our overall well-being as a nation. It’s also striking that the flattening GPI trend since the 1970s probably matches how most people feel about their lives—not much progress, and for many a real struggle to get by.

"11 ways Wall Street is more than a symbol of inequities in our economy and our democracy
As protests resume on Wall Street, some in the media are again saying that there is no coherent rationale for the demonstrations. In fact, though, these protesters have chosen the right target: a set of institutions and actors who not only played a central role in creating the financial crisis, but have worked to foster a more unequal U.S. economy and democracy over recent decades – with the effect of undermining America’s middle class.
The origins of the financial crisis and efforts to reform Wall Street have been overshadowed in the past year by other issues, particularly the jobs crisis and the push to reduce budget deficits. 
But the ongoing protests offer a good occasion to step back and consider the broad ways in which the financial industry – and the financialization of the U.S. economy – have worked at odds with the interests of ordinary Americans and broad, sustained economic growth in the real economy. Below are eleven ways that Wall Street is more than just a mere symbol of the inequities in our economy and our democracy.
 
While many players were involved in pumping up the housing bubble starting in the late 1990s, leading financial institutions were key culprits in this story – and, worse, ensured a catastrophic hard landing when the bubble deflated. Wall Street’s insatiable appetite for mortgages that it could bundle into securities, making huge profits, helped fuel irresponsible lending. Its undue influence on credit ratings agencies caused these watchdogs to turn a blind eye to the huge risks associated with securities backed by subprime loans. In turn, by making over-leveraged bets backed by these assets – bets which served no economically productive purpose – Wall Street investment firms laid the ground work for a global financial disaster.
A focus on “shareholder value” has trumped all other goals for the modern corporation since the 1980s – a shift that Wall Street helped usher in through a relentless search for profits that included leveraged buy outs, mergers and acquisitions, and private equity deals, as well as a more aggressive quest for short-term trading gains. This narrow focus on the bottom line has undermined American workers and the middle class by justifying any cost-cutting measures that can boost quarterly earnings, including foreign outsourcing, eliminating benefits, and busting unions. Nearly all the forces typically blamed for rising inequality – globalization, new technologies, declining unionization – have had a more devastating impact on U.S. living standards thanks to Wall Street’s imperative to put stock price above all else. The bottom line focus has also been devastating to the environment, giving companies a greater incentive to oppose any costs aimed at controlling how much they pollute.
Spending nearly $5 billion in political donations and lobbying over the past 15 years, the financial industry largely succeeded in writing its own rules, at the cost of protecting investors, consumers and – ultimately – the broader economy. Even after the financial crisis, Wall Street worked aggressively to resist common-sense regulations. According to OpenSecrets.org, the financial industry has spent $571 million on lobbying since the start of 2009 and $174 million on campaign donations. At the height of the legislative fight over financial reform last year, it was spending over $1 million a day to influence Congress. In addition, through its contributions to the Chamber of Commerce, the Club for Growth, and conservative think tanks like the Heritage Foundation, Wall Street institutions and leaders have helped bankroll a broader effort to weaken regulatory safeguards, derail laws to improve working families’ quality of life, and undo our social insurance programs. Among other things, Wall Street firms have bankrolled efforts to privatize Social Security – a shift that would benefit the financial industry while exposing Americans to major new economic risks. 
The main role of financial markets – in theory, anyway – is to mobilize and allocate capital in ways that foster economic growth and innovation. Increasingly, though, these markets have been turned into tools aimed at personal enrichment and Wall Street has lately compiled a troubling record of allocating vast amounts of capital to unproductive purposes in pursuit on short-term speculative gains. The dotcom boom of the 1990s channeled major wealth to unproven companies that later flamed out, while Wall Street’s role in securitizing and peddling subprime mortgages led investors to unwittingly bankroll an unproductive – and ultimately, catastrophic – housing bubble. In both cases, Wall Street investment firms and traders scored huge gains while ordinary investors were left with major losses.
The financial industry has aggressively resisted efforts to close the carried-interest loophole that improperly treats income that hedge fund managers and private equity executives earn by investing other people’s money as capital gains, allowing some of the largest paychecks collected today in America to be subject to the lowest tax rate. Wall Street is now lobbying against the “Buffett Rule” which would close this loophole and, more broadly, Wall Street money has played a central role in underwriting anti-tax groups like the Club for Growth. In addition, Wall Street firms have engaged in systematic tax avoidance through the use of foreign subsidiaries to shelter income from U.S. tax rates. In 2008, for example, Goldman Sachs reported profits of over $2 billion. Yet it had 29 subsidiaries located in offshore tax havens, and paid federal taxes of just $14 million on those profits.
Since 1996 (the year finance overtook manufacturing as America’s most profitable sector) 90 percent of income growth has gone to the top 10 percent of incomes. Income from Wall Street has played an outsized role in this trend. Pay for Wall Street insiders has skyrocketed, with bonuses increasing 20 fold in just twenty years as average workers’ pay stagnated. Average pay in finance is now181 percentthat of the average private sector worker. But the excessive pay hasn’t been limited to those who work on the Street. Stock market activity has inflated the pay of executives in the real economy as well, as more have come from tax-preferred capital income. The pay above and beyond a base salary for top 5 executives at all publicly-traded companies increased five-fold between 1992 and 2006, to over $29 billion. 
While investment banks used to make most of their money through working with real businesses, many shifted their focus to financial speculation starting in the 1990s. Technology enabled high- frequency trading, which mechanically leeches profit off of incidental stock price swings. Derivatives – which were initially designed to play a constructive role in reducing risk – became instruments of speculation so complex that even top financial executive didn’t understand the outsized bets their firms were making. The vast majority of derivatives trades in recent years have been naked bets by traders who have no interest in the underlying asset. How much has this come to dominate our financial markets? In just three days, speculators in the unregulated foreign exchange and interest rate derivative markets gamble more ($6.1 trillion per day) than the entire U.S. economy can create in real goods and services in a year.  
Ever since Wall Street lobbying and influence helped deregulate financial services two decades ago, Americans’ relationship to their lenders has grown increasingly toxic. Wall Street banks like Wells Fargo, Capital One, Citigroup and Chase all had subprime lending arms that targeted working-class communities with high fee and -interest mortgage loans, often just to refinance – and strip wealth from – existing assets. Beyond mortgages, Wall Street even finances usurious, 455 percent APR corner-store payday lending to the tune of nearly $3 billion a year. Wall Street has also managed to indenture America’s next generation, with Wall Street-financed private student loans charging unlimited interest rates that can be as high as 18 percent. 
Three years after the financial crisis, not a single top Wall Street executive or trader has been accountable for criminal actions that help cause the crash. For example, while civil suits have turned up evidence that Wall Street firms knowingly deceived investors about the risks of mortgage-backed securities – a form of fraud – the U.S. Justice Department not pursued any criminal cases against these firms or the executives who ran them. Settlements reached by the U.S. government with key figures involved in fueling the mortgage collapse, such as former Countrywide CEO Angelo Mozillo, have exacted insignificant punishment in comparison to the profits made – and have not involved any criminal charges or outright admission of wrongdoing. Meanwhile, Wall Street is bankrolling congressional Republicans who are try to gut the budget of the Securities and Exchange Commission and other watchdogs.
Thanks to vast spending on lobbying, Wall Street ensured that Congress passed a watered-down version of financial reform last year. Now they are working to undermine even that modest legislation, working every day to eviscerate various provisions of the Dodd-Frank law. In particular, Wall Street lobbyists have waged a relentless war against the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was established to curb a wide range of abusive practices by Wall Street banks and other lenders. Wall Street has also bitterly fought other provisions of Dodd-Frank, such as a new whistleblower law that rewards insiders who reveal financial crimes. Wall Street campaign donors have lavishly rewarded leading critics of Dodd-Frank, including Senators like Jim DeMint, who have proposed repealing the law entirely. Three years after the financial crisis, Wall Street not only denies that it did anything wrong or criminal, but is working tirelessly to thwart efforts to ensure that a similar crisis never happens again.
In March, the World Top Incomes Database, a project of economists Facundo Alvaredo, Tony Atkinson, Thomas Piketty, and Emmanuel Saez, showed that in the first year after the recession (2010), the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans took home no less than 93 percent of all income gains.
In absolute numbers the picture is just as stark. Mike Konczal of the Roosevelt Institute crunched the data and showed that Americans in the bottom 90 percent lost $127 in income over 2009 to 2010 while the top one percent saw their incomes grow by $105,637.
Occupy Wall Street was hugely successful in injecting the issue of income inequality into our political discourse, something long overdue, some would say by 30 years. With the numbers in for the first year of the so-called “Recovery,” we now know that Occupy was even more accurate in their critique. But the numbers also suggest that without major reforms, we’re on the road back to the status quo. We need Occupy now more than ever.
Ultimately, the lesson is clear: the middle class will not benefit from a growing economy unless policies are in place to deliver widely shared prosperity.

"Background on one of the landmark pieces of financial reform legislation associated with Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal.
Ten years ago last November, a Republican-led Congress and a Democratic White House rolled out the red carpet for a new age of global, “full service,” too-big-to-fail financial institutions. The move repealed the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, a set of reforms responsible for the longest crisis-free period in U.S. financial history. At the time, industry lobbyists argued that this modern experiment in deregulation would bring greater stability and competitiveness to the financial services industry. Today, it is clear that they were wrong—and spectacularly so. Competition is suffering from high concentration and anti-competitive subsidies to the biggest institutions, and the system has been radically destabilized by unregulated activities, costing taxpayers nearly $19.3 trillion1 in bailouts and subsidies. As Washington debates the best way to prevent future crises, it is helpful to understand how public policy helped bring about the current one.
 
Officially known as the Banking Act of 1933, it was one of the landmark pieces of legislation associated with Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal. The measure established the concept of deposit insurance and set up the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to provide it. Glass-Steagall2 also erected a firewall between commercial banks, which take deposits and make loans, and investment banks, which organize the sale of bonds and stocks.
 
Between 1929 and 1933, more than 4,000 U.S. banks had closed permanently, saddling depositors with close to $400 million in losses. In March 1933, President Roosevelt had been forced to shut down the entire banking system for four days. The law at the time allowed banks to traffic freely in securities. A congressional investigation led by a firebrand prosecutor named Ferdinand Pecora unearthed massive evidence of recklessness, cronyism, and fraud both in the use of depositor funds and in the promotion of securities for sale to the public. A top executive of Chase National Bank (ancestor of today’s JPMorgan Chase) had enriched himself by short-selling his company’s shares during the stock market crash. National City Bank (now Citibank) had taken a heap of failed loans to Latin American governments, packaged them as securities, and unloaded them on unsuspecting investors.3
Banking and securities underwriting made for a poisonous combination, many people concluded. The Glass-Steagall Act accordingly gave banks a year to decide: they could get out of the securities business, and enjoy the benefits of deposit insurance and access to the low-interest credit of the Federal Reserve; or they could be investment banks and brokerage houses, forego those privileges.
 
Glass-Steagall’s goal was to lay a new foundation of integrity and stability for America’s banks. It worked. Financial panics had been regular and devastating occurrences since before the Civil War. No more. While individual banks continued to fail occasionally, their depositors escaped largely unscathed. Trust in the stock and bond markets also grew; for investors around the world, the U.S. financial system seemed to set a high standard of transparency and reliability.
Building on the apparent success of 1930s banking and securities regulation, Congress decided to establish a Glass-Steagall-style wall between banking and insurance. Under the Bank Holding Act of 1956, banks were permitted to sell insurance, but not to underwrite it. (Had that rule remained in force down to the present day, AIG would have been unable to weave banks into its web of toxic credit derivatives, which are structured as insurance contracts.)
 
By the early 1980s, anti-regulation advocates had won sway in Washington. With steady weakening of the financial regulatory structure came a new period of crisis and volatility that began with the Savings and Loan crisis4 and has yet to end. In the spring of 1987, the Federal Reserve Board voted 3-2 to let banks engage in a range of securities underwriting activities. One of the dissenting votes was cast by Fed chairman Paul Volcker, who feared (among other things) that banks would again seek to profit from lucrative loan securitization opportunities.5
His successor, Alan Greenspan, had more faith in the self-correcting machinery of unfettered markets. During the presidency of George H.W. Bush, Greenspan and Treasury Secretary James Baker took steps that weakened Glass-Steagall by, for example, letting banks underwrite municipal bonds on the premise that they were safe by definition. In 1991, the administration called on Congress to repeal the law outright. Although a bill to that effect was voted down in the House of Representatives that year, the anti-Glass-Steagall movement was clearly gaining steam.6
 
In the interim, financier Sanford Weil had taken advantage of various exemptions in the law to build an empire of insurance, commercial-banking, and investment-banking units. In early 1998, he proposed a merger to Citicorp’s John Reed.
The idea was a brazen violation of Glass-Steagall. But by now, Greenspan had prevailed on the Fed to let bank holding companies own investment-bank affiliates with as much as 25 percent of their business in securities underwriting. (The previous ceiling had been 10 percent.) Meanwhile, the Clinton administration, with the ex-investment banker—and future Citigroup Chairman—Robert Rubin as Treasury Secretary, was sympathetic to the case for bigger and more diversified banks in the name of American global competitiveness.
After heads-up phone calls to Greenspan, Rubin, and Bill Clinton, Weil and Reed announced the biggest-ever corporate merger, resulting in the biggest-ever financial services company. For a brief time, it appeared that the Fed might require the new entity to sell off its insurance operations. Weil’s solution was to crank up another Glass-Steagall repeal effort and wait out the result, assuming that no one in power would object. He had figured right. The final push took a year and a half, and entailed hundreds of millions of dollars in lobbying and campaign contributions. But on November 12, 1999, Clinton signed the Financial Modernization Act (commonly known as Gramm-Leach-Bliley) into law.7
On Capitol Hill, only a few people resisted. One was North Dakota Senator Byron Dorgan, who, on May 11, 1999, made an impassioned floor speech “captured only by the cameras of CSPAN-2,” according to one account. “I want to sound a warning call today about this legislation,” Dorgan declared. “I think this legislation is just fundamentally terrible.”8
Some House Democrats initially argued that the banks should not be given so much without delivering anything in return. Most of them relented, however, after the bill was sweetened with provisions that modestly expanded the Community Reinvestment Act. In the end, the vote in both chambers was overwhelming. Only eight Senators voted no: seven Democrats (Dorgan, Barbara Boxer, Barbara Mikulski, Tom Harkin, Richard Bryan, Russ Feingold, Paul Wellstone) and one Republican, Richard Shelby of Alabama.
“You’ve seen the roll call,” Dorgan recalled. “We didn’t really have to deal with push back because they had such a strong, strong body of support for what they call modernization that the vote was never in doubt... The title of the bill was ‘The Financial Modernization Act…’ [I]f you don’t want to modernize, I guess you’re considered hopelessly old fashioned.”9
 
Some of the leading proponents of repeal were among its most conspicuous beneficiaries. Phil Gramm, after retiring in 2002, went to work for UBS AG, a Swiss commercial bank that moved into investment banking, with disastrous results.10 Rubin, who had stepped down as Treasury Secretary shortly before the vote, resurfaced as chairman of Citigroup’s executive committee, with a reported initial annual compensation in the $40 million neighborhood.11 Citigroup lost $27.7 billion in 2008 and lives on as a ward of the federal government, second only to AIG in the huge sums of taxpayer money it has required to remain solvent.12
Another prominent advocate of repeal, Lawrence Summers, succeeded Rubin as Treasury Secretary and now heads President Obama’s White House Council of Economic Advisors. “This historic legislation will better enable American companies to compete in the new economy,” Summers said after Congress approved Gramm-Leach-Bliley.13
The current Treasury Secretary, Timothy Geithner, is a devotee of the Rubin-Summers school of deregulation, and has offered systemic risk legislation that falls far short of restoring prudential size and activity limits on today’s megabanks.
 
Did the abandonment of Glass-Steagall contribute to the financial meltdown? Some commentators profess to see little connection, since, they say, most of the damage was sown by pure investment banks such as MorganStanley, Bear Stearns, and Lehman Brothers and by the effectively unregulated, runaway insurance company, AIG.
But commercial banks played a crucial role as buyers and sellers of mortgage-backed securities, credit-default swaps, and other explosive financial derivatives. Without the watering down and ultimate repeal of Glass-Steagall, the banks would have been barred from most of these activities. The market and appetite for derivatives would then have been far smaller, and Washington might not have felt a need to rescue the institutional victims.
As a candidate for president, Barack Obama seemed to see the link. “A regulatory structure set up for banks in the 1930s needed to change,” he said in his March 27, 2008, speech at New York City’s Cooper Union. “But by the time the Glass-Steagall Act was repealed in 1999, the $300 million lobbying effort that drove deregulation was more about facilitating mergers than creating an efficient regulatory framework… Unfortunately,” he went on to say, “instead of establishing a 21st century regulatory framework, we simply dismantled the old one,” thereby encouraging “a winner take all, anything goes environment that helped foster devastating dislocations in our economy.”14
Today, though, the Obama administration seems disposed to let giants be giants, while subjecting them to more regulation (and developing an emergency plan to unwind those that run amok in the future). By contrast, Paul Volcker would restore the basic principle of Glass-Steagall, with banks restricted to banking again. “The banks are there to serve the public,” he said recently, “and that is what they should concentrate on. These other activities create conflicts of interest. They create risks, and if you try to control the risks with supervision, that just creates friction and difficulties… and ultimately fails.”15
Former Citicorp CEO John Reed—co-architect of the great merger—recently voiced the same opinion.16 And even Alan Greenspan, while not defending the precise regulatory architecture of Glass-Steagall, has come around to the view that if financial institutions are truly too big to fail, they just might be too big to exist.17",research

"Dear Senator:
Demos is a public policy organization working for an America where we all have an equal say in our democracy and an equal chance in our economy. We write to urge you to reject President Trump’s nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to a lifetime appointment on the nation’s highest court.
Judge Gorsuch has gone out of his way to support the wealthy and powerful over the rest of us, often breaking with his appellate court colleagues to do so. On issues ranging from Wall Street accountability to workers rights to criminal justice, he would move the country backwards.
With the Supreme Court split four-to-four on so many critical topics, the stakes could not be higher. Judge Gorsuch has gone out of his way to support the wealthy and powerful over the rest of us, often breaking with his appellate court colleagues to do so.1 On issues ranging from Wall Street accountability to workers rights to criminal justice, he would move the country backwards.2
Here, Demos highlights one important issue that requires rejection of President Trump’s nominee: Judge Gorsuch’s troubling record on money in politics and his potential to be the deciding vote to gut our few remaining protections against big money dominating our democracy.
The next Supreme Court justice will have a pivotal role in ensuring our Constitution protects the rights and voices of all Americans. For four decades, the Court’s flawed approach to money in politics has shredded a series of common-sense protections against the power of special interests and wealthy individuals, and shaped a system where the size of our wallets determines the strength of our voices.3
The public is deeply concerned about the impact of concentrated wealth on our democracy and understands the role of the Court. Ninety-four percent of voters believe that the power of big money in politics is a problem, and ninety percent say that the Supreme Court plays an important role in setting the rules.4 In fact, 85% of Americans believe we need fundamental changes to our system for funding political campaigns.5
We need a ninth justice who understands that a true democracy cannot elevate big money over the voices of ordinary people and who will be open to reasonable limits that protect the rights and influence of all Americans. The vast majority of Americans agree – including 91 percent of Trump voters.6
Unfortunately, Judge Gorsuch’s record on money in politics have convinced us that he will not be the type of open-minded justice we need to rescue our pro-democracy Constitution.
In the two directly relevant cases Judge Gorsuch faced, he voted to expand First Amendment rights for corporations and went out of his way to signal openness to applying the harshest possible standard of review to campaign contribution limits.7 Taken together, these opinions suggest that Judge Gorsuch would be receptive to attacks on our few remaining protections against big money—specifically the current bans on “soft money” contributions to political parties and corporate contributions directly to candidates.8 Please see the accompanying fact sheet for more details.
In a world where Judge Gorsuch forms a majority block of pro-big money justices, large corporations and wealthy individuals would enjoy virtually unlimited ability to translate their economic might into political power. Our legislatures and other elected offices will become even more skewed by race and class; policy will become even more tilted towards the preferences of the white, wealthy donor class; and people of color and working families across the nation will continue to fall behind economically and be alienated politically.9
Judge Gorsuch’s troubling record on money in politics and other issues is sufficient reason to oppose his confirmation. But in these extraordinary times there is an additional concern: we are not convinced that Judge Gorsuch has the requisite independence to stand up to President Trump when necessary to protect our democracy and communities.
From the unconstitutional Muslim travel ban to direct attacks on our independent judiciary to deliberate attempts to undermine respect for freedom of the press and the very concept of the truth, we face a new, alarming threat from the Trump Administration every day. An independent judiciary is more critical than ever in this context. Yet, Judge Gorsuch has shown troubling deference to unfettered executive power, and Trump’s advisors have assured his supporters that Gorsuch and Trump “support each other.”10
For all of these reasons, Demos urges you to do everything in your power to defeat Judge Neil Gorsuch’s confirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court—including applying a 60-vote threshold for moving to a final vote.
Put simply, Judge Gorsuch has not shown sufficient commitment to our constitutional values of liberty, equality, and justice for all to earn Demos’ support, or yours.
Sincerely,
Heather McGhee

" Introducing The Virtual State Bank
Oregon can put its public funds to use in a way that creates jobs and tilts the economic playing field back toward Main Street businesses, family farms, and our community banks. A Virtual State Bank (VSB), based on the principles of the successful Bank of North Dakota, will raise revenue for Oregon without raising taxes, and consolidate and strengthen our economic development programs. Finally, the VSB — known in the proposed legislation as the Oregon Finance and Credit Board — will make Oregon businesses and farms less dependent on the Wall Street banks that have cut back on lending to small businesses here.
 
Now more than ever, the future of Oregon’s middle class depends on the health of our small businesses. Yet the engine of a thriving small business economy — affordable credit for viable businesses — has stalled in our state since the financial industry set off the Great Recession of 2008. While Oregon has lost 148,600 jobs1 and approximately 50,000 acres of family farmland2 in the last three years, the largest banks have returned to profitability after taxpayer bailouts. Many of these same banks have refused to restore lending for credit-worthy small businesses and consumers to pre-crisis levels.3
These big banks have been costing us jobs in Oregon.
For example, in 2010, Bank of America made just six Small Business Association 7(a) loans — the flagship program for small business lending — in Oregon.4 That was a 92 percent decline from the bank’s 77 SBA 7(a) loans in 2007, a drop that has pushed viable Oregon small businesses either out of business or onto higher-interest credit cards.5 The average business card interest rate is 16 percent, but quality SBA 7(a) loans average seven to nine percent. In 2009, 97 percent of the bank’s Oregon small business loans were on higher-interest credit cards.6
Lending cutbacks by the big banks have had a disproportionate impact on the Oregon economy due to high bank consolidation in the state. Here, three large out-of-state banks — US Bank, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo — currently control 47 percent of all deposits, up from 42.5 percent before the crisis.8 None is chartered or based in Oregon.9
 
Oil and gas in the ground is not all North Dakota has going for it. While the state treasuries in Oregon and other states send billions of dollars out-of-state by banking with Wall Street banks each year, the 92-year-old Bank of North Dakota (BND) keeps taxpayer dollars in-state, cycling them back through community banks to help small businesses and farms add local jobs.
The Bank of North Dakota doesn’t compete with community banks; it supports them to create a ‘crowding in’ effect. From 2007 to 2009 — through the trough of the financial crisis — BND increased its lending to strengthen the state’s economy and save jobs. BND’s business lending actually grew by 35 percent.11
That’s the essence of countercyclical, and Oregon is poised to be the first state in the nation to adopt the principles of North Dakota’s model.
In broad terms, BND has helped North Dakota keep Main Street banks serving credit-worthy business borrowers in tough times. BND levels the playing field for community banks in markets that would otherwise be dominated by big out-of-state banks. BND supports local banks with the participation loans, bank-stock purchases, and — with the state’s economic development programs — interest rate buy-downs that make possible productive loans that would otherwise not be made.
BND has done all that in partnership with the state’s economic development programs and at a profit, about half of which it pays annually into North Dakota’s General Fund.
It’s a tremendous success as a business and as economic policy.
 
Elected leaders serious about crafting policies that produce new jobs and new revenue know that a BND-style Virtual State Bank is one of very few good options. They want to put public money to work providing what Oregon small businesses and family farms need most: access to the affordable capital they need to grow.
A VSB for Oregon will partner with local banks to keep public money at home, where it will:
 
Oregon has every reason to follow this successful model. A VSB — first as a $500+ million fund, and later as a depository for the state’s Short Term Funds — has the opportunity to put Oregon money to work right here, supporting the small businesses, farms, and community banks that make Oregon go.

"Answers to frequently asked questions about an Oregon Virtual State Bank
Would the Virtual State Bank compete with community banks?
No. The Virtual State Bank would partner with community banks to help expand their lending markets. In fact, the VSB would be statutorily prohibited from retail operations.
Why does Oregon need a Virtual State Bank?
Oregon can use public funds here in Oregon to increase local businesses and farms' access to capital. With loan participations, capital access, and other programs, the VSB will partner with local financial institutions to help Oregon entrepreneurs grow their businesses and add jobs.
Read the full policy paper
How would the Virtual State Bank keep public money safe?
The VSB will not take on above-average risk or below-market rate loans. The VSB will have stringent safeguards in place to protect taxpayers and manage risk conservatively.
Who would run the Virtual State Bank?
The day-to-day operations will be managed by an executive director who must have extensive experience in banking. An Advisory Council composed of representatives from the Oregon community bank, small business, building trades, and agricultural sectors will review operations and finances. Finally, a Governing Board composed of the Governor, State Treasurer, and Labor Commissioner will ensure public accountability for the VSB's operations.
Why not just deposit more state money in local financial institutions?
Uninsured public deposits must be collateralized to high degrees. This means they cannot be put into loans and are often too costly for community banks to hold. Using state deposits to leverage new small business lending and job growth allows community banks to make more loans in their communities.
How would the Virtual State Bank improve economic development tools for community banks?
First, revenue generated by the VSB's operations would add funding to economic development programs. Second, the VSB will improve the coordination of state economic development tools to make it easier for community banks to participate.",policy-briefs
"The mortgage servicing deal reached today between a coalition of state attorneys general and five major Wall Street banks is an important stepping stone in the effort to secure justice for homeowners victimized by the fraud and abuse behind the foreclosure crisis.
This settlement is perhaps most valuable for what it doesn't do — thanks to the determination of attorneys general from states hardest hit by foreclosures, the provisions that would have extended far-reaching immunity to Wall Street banks from all future fraud-related prosecution have been removed, limiting today's agreement narrowly to the robo-signing infractions uncovered last fall.
It is important to bear in mind why exactly today's settlement must be viewed as a first step rather than a resolution of the struggle for accountability in the foreclosure crisis: the $17 billion pledged for principal reduction — and the nearly-insulting $2,000 in homeowner restitution — pales in comparison to the total $7.7 trillion in household wealth lost in the mortgage meltdown.
Furthermore, families of color absorbed a disproportionately high share of these losses: from 2005-2009, household wealth collapsed by 53% for black families and by 66% for Hispanic families — compared to a mere 16% contraction for white households. Much of this historic and tragic loss can be attributed directly to bankers and brokers targeting borrowers of color with high-rate loans, even when they qualified for prime loans, often steering existing homeowners into high-rate re-financings that only served to strip hard-won wealth. Until a settlement is reached that secures a level of funding reflective of the degree of wealth lost in this crisis and distributed to those who need it most, the case of mortgage fraud and abuse will remain unresolved.

"The campaign money chase makes the sliver of Americans who donate large sums the most important citizens, and they are both unrepresentative (90 percent of 2012 presidential donors were from majority-white neighborhoods) and, by definition, doing well in our inequitable economy. A quarter of all the money in the presidential race through 2015 came from donors who gave more than $1 million. It’s not much better in congressional races, with the majority of money coming from $1,000-plus donors. To put that in context, $1,000 is more than the average U.S. worker makes in a week.
Is this just an outgrowth of inequality, or does it actually help fuel it? Research suggests it’s both, because the donor class has outsized influence over policy outcomes. A recent study found that senators’ positions reflect the average donor’s wishes over their constituents’ views, and even over voters in their own party. And yet another study calculated that the wealthy have 15 times more political efficacy than the middle class.

"Conservative Dems shouldn't be fooled: The ""CAP"" Act would mandate huge cuts to popular domestic programs — even when there's a budget surplus.
Congress returns from a two-week recess today. But for legislators who spent the time championing the House Republicans' extreme agenda to slash federal spending, the break was more like detention. Town hall meetings across the country erupted into bedlam as members came face-to-face with the actual beneficiaries of public spending on health care, retirement, college, food supports, and more.
In Orlando, Rep. Daniel Webster was shouted down by furious constituents. ""Florida has had this policy for the last 12 years,"" said one town-hall attendee, referring to the state's low taxes and meager public benefits. ""We don't have money to take care of the poor, and unemployment is at 11 percent!""
Everyone in Washington wants big spending cuts, particularly as a concession for raising the debt limit. But few people outside Washington want spending on them to be cut. So what is a conservative Congress member to do? Enter the new Capitol Hill bipartisan policy darling, the innocuous-sounding ""global spending cap."" Last Tuesday, Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia, became the latest lawmaker to sign on to the most prominent spending-cap proposal, the Corker-McCaskill Commitment to American Prosperity Act.

"Few of us recall that the full name of the march where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. gave his ""I Have a Dream"" speech was the ""March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom."" Jobs, even before freedom. Today, Dr. King would be calling our generation to action because economic inequality and insecurity has risen sharply over the course of our lifetimes, to the point that we are the first in American history poised to be worse-off economically than the previous one.
Young people should remember that Dr. King was only 26 years old when he led the Montgomery Bus Boycotts in 1955. Twenty-six. And we shouldn't let the complexity of ""the economy"" get in the way of taking action. Just think of the economy as a massive, multi-player game where the most powerful gamers, whether it's businesses executives or government officials, are constantly tweaking the rules that make it easier or harder for some players and some teams to score points. And just like in a game, individual talent and determination matter in the economy -- of course they do -- but the rules of the game guide the outcome. And also like a game, it often matters most what team you start out on.
That's why we have to constantly ask a fundamental question: what is our economy for? What is the purpose of the game and therefore, what principles should guide the rules we set?
In Dr. King's time, the goal of economic policy was full employment and higher wages; the values were communitarian. Consider Robert Kennedy in 1963: ""It is the essence of responsibility to put the public good ahead of personal gain.""
Fast forward to 1982, when President Reagan boasted about wanting ""to see an America in which people can still get rich."" And he wasn't alone; leaders and economists in both parties began to believe that the best way for everyone to succeed was if the rules were written to ensure the greatest possible accumulation of wealth at the top and the biggest profits at the biggest corporations. The rich would drive the ""growth,"" and money would trickle down to the rest of America.
So what rules needed to change to create a trickle-down economy? Well, since it is easier for some people -- particularly stock market investors and executives at a company -- to get rich if corporate profits are high because the costs of hiring workers is low, a low minimum wage and weak unions became a goal of organized business in the 1970s. As a result, the minimum wage has lost nearly half of its purchasing power since its peak in 1968, and fewer than 1 in 10 workers is now in a union. The rules of the economic game were also changed to make it easier for businesses to ship jobs to places with cheaper, more easily exploitable workers, to avoid paying their taxes, and to influence our elected leaders.
Back in 1955, corporations used to contribute nearly 30 percent of the federal taxes collected; today it's just 9 percent and dozens of the most successful U.S. businesses pay their CEOs more every year than they contribute to their country in taxes.
At the same time as the rules changed to make it easier for a small sliver of us to amass and keep unprecedented wealth, the rules didn't change to keep up with the changing times in ways that would have given more families a leg up -- like responding to the premium on education with more college grants, not fewer, or responding to the necessity of both parents working or the rise of single parents with financial help for child care, or by providing universal health care, portable pensions, or a more generous unemployment insurance system in the era of easy layoffs and downsizing.
How is it that life has gotten harder financially for the vast majority of Americans over the past forty years, yet we have had so few public solutions?
The problem is that our democracy has become as unequal as our economy. Over the course of my lifetime, an entire new industry has appeared: corporate lobbyists, for which there are now 24 for every member of Congress. The legalized bribery that is big-money campaign contributions increased by over 600 percent just since I turned 18, to over $2 billion a year. Members of Congress now spend 1 out of every 3 minutesthey're in office fundraising.
While not every business, even not every big business, is in Washington to push policies that disadvantage workers and families, the sum total of the flood of business cash and lobbying in Washington honestly drowns out the voices of regular families on a day-to-day basis. I know, I work there. Princeton political scientist Larry Bartels found that ""the preferences of people at the bottom third of the income distribution appear to have no apparent impact on the behavior of their elected officials."" None.
But something else happened in our culture. Why did it somehow become publicly acceptable to evade taxes as if companies and people owe nothing to their neighbors or to the country they live in? Completely okay to assert that any kind of public help -- from health care to unemployment insurance -- is unfair redistribution from worthy job creators to undeserving freeloaders? To demonize the class of people who in different eras were known as ""the little guy,"" the little guy you root for?
This, I believe, is where the increasingly unexamined role of unconscious bias comes in to our public culture in ways that are eroding opportunity for all of us. Since Dr. King's time, we have had a deep and growing anxiety in this country about who is American.
Why do I say since Dr. King's time? Two things happened at once in the mid-1960s: the Civil Rights Act of 1964 finally decreed that the law could not discriminate based on skin color, upsetting the social order -- and the Immigration Act of 1965 began to change the face of America.
Did you know that until 1965, the United States had race-based national origin limits on who could legally immigrate into the country? There was a strict limit to the number of Asians and Africans, and even a limit on Southern and Eastern Europeans, who were considered ethnic; Northern European countries had no limit. And so the past 40 years have seen a dramatic transformation. Unfortunately and ironically, America became more diverse after the Civil Rights Movement subsided, taking it with it the moral voice calling for solidarity and brotherhood across racial lines. Instead, the loudest voices have been stoking resentment and division.
So why does this new diversity impact Americans' feelings about public solutions to common problems, about economic fairness and taxes and jobs? Is it because we are all racist? Not quite, but not no, either. The human brain naturally puts objects and people and ideas into categories -- it is part of our great intelligence. And it naturally takes shortcuts to do these categorizations: a red round thing on the table is an apple, fiji, macintosh or not, and an orange round thing is an orange, mandarin, navel or not. And apples are sweet, oranges are tart.
Our brain categorizes people by their physical characteristics as well -- and to go beyond that, it finds shortcuts to give meaningful attributes to those categories. And most of these shortcuts are going on subconsciously, without our conscious awareness.
The problem is that our society has been so hierarchical along these lines -- race, gender, age, sexuality -- that the shortcuts we are constantly primed to make have unequal consequences.
Studies of Implicit Bias where you are asked to quickly associate words with faces demonstrate that we are nearly universally less able to quickly associate darker faces with positive words, though white respondents find it more difficult than non-whites. All that is to say, prejudice and stereotyping is normal.
That doesn't make it acceptable, but it does make it understandable and it certainly means we can't keep pretending it's not still with us. America is the great multi-racial, multi-ethnic experiment in democracy! No other wealthy country tries to create a democracy out such diversity, and say that we all are supposed to feel like a community. We must see that as part of our exceptionalism: acknowledge the challenges and take a bit of good old fashioned American pride in working at it every day. We must not, as we have since the 1970s, wish it away under a myth that we can be colorblind.
If we don't acknowledge racial hierarchy and biases, our entire society will continue to fall victim to the inequities, instability and insecurity that comes when people don't feel like they're all in it together, when people are allowed to be just in it for themselves.
Dr. King knew this. He defined the state of true economic justice as attaining ""the brotherhood of man."" Now, I work in the field of economic policy. Never, not once, have I heard someone refer to the goal of economic policy as achieving the ""brotherhood of man.""
What would the brotherhood of man look like in economic policy? I think it would look like people being proud to pay taxes because that's paying back the investment the country made in your success -- and feeling like you need to help provide for our future, even though you may not recognize what the future looks like. And I think it would look like government and business and philanthropists working together to ensure that the basics of life -- a great education, a roof over your head, a way to care for your children or for yourself when you're sick, an old age with dignity -- were not out of reach for most Americans but were the minimum that we can guarantee for us all. And I think it would look like the CEOs of American companies seeing their job not just to create profits for investors, but to create good jobs, jobs with dignity for their fellow human beings.
Because when we say that the CEO of Wal-Mart, for example, is worth $10,000 an hour, whereas his co-worker is worth $7 an hour in the US or pennies an hour in the factory in India or Malaysia where the product on the shelves is made, what does that mean? When you see two smartphones, and one costs $30 and one costs $300, what do you decide? The more expensive one is better, of course.
Now see how easy it is to apply that same logic to human beings? And do you see how wrong that is? Dr. King did.
We are the children of Dr. King's dream because we are the most diverse generation in American history. But fundamentally, we are the children of his dream because we are the generation that is left to fulfill that dream. We have not yet attained the brotherhood of man in this country; in fact, as our racial anxieties have gone underground as the Civil Rights Movement ended, we have lost ground in achieving true economic justice in our society.
Fortunately for the future, our generation, having grown up hearing that you're on your own has decided that in fact, no -- we're in this together. According to public polling, more than any other generation since the Depression-Era generation -- the first Greatest Generation, but I promise you not the last -- we believe in individuals sacrificing for the common good, not just seeking out private gain.
That's why I believe that it will be us, the children of the Dream, who finally achieve a sustainable, fair economy, where everyone, regardless of what zip code or school district they were born into, can meet their basic needs and have a shot at fulfilling their dreams.

"Senate testimony on policies needed to ensure all Americans a chance to move into the middle class and stay there.
America’s economy has been an awesome engine of wealth creation over the past two generations, but the new prosperity has disproportionately gone to the wealthiest. Between 1979 and 2010, according to the Congressional Budget Office, American households in the richest one percent of the income distribution saw after-tax income gains of 202 percent 1—while the 60 percent of the households in the middle saw their incomes grow by only 39 percent over this same period.2 The CBO also finds that the share of after-tax income going to the richest one percent has increase d from 7.4 percent in 1979 to 12.8 percent in 2010.3 At the same time, the share going to least well-off 60 percent of Americans has declined, from 36.2 percent in 1979 to 32.5 percent in 2010.
According to much research, social mobility—the very essence of the American idea—has remained stagnant for decades, and many of our global competitors are now performing far better on what we have long considered to be the American Dream.4 For example, young men are earning ten cents per dollar less than their fathers did 30 years ago, according to research from Demos.5 Princeton economist Alan Krueger observes that the economic data “challenge the notion that the United States is an exceptionally mobile society. If the United States stands out in comparison with other countries, it is in having a more static distribution of income across generations with fewer opportunities for advancement.”6
The rising inequality of wealth and income that threaten shared prosperity and democracy long preceded the financial crash of 2008 and the downturn that followed. As a result of major economic and policy changes over the past three decades, the gap between the richest and the rest of America has become a chasm. Many jobs do not pay enough to cover basic living expenses, much less allow workers to save and build for the future. In fact, a quarter of full-time working-age adults are still not earning enough money to meet basic economic needs like housing, utilities, food, health care, and transportation for themselves or their families.7
 A host of public policy choices have driven inequality and insecurity—including tax cuts that disproportionately benefitted the wealthy, state divestment in public higher education, financial deregulation, and the weakening of labor protections, to name only a few. Job growth on its own will not reverse inequality: the shift to a low-pay service economy has in fact accelerated during the economic recovery. Over the next two decades, the Department of Labor projects that the largest job growth will be in low-wage jobs offering little opportunity for advancement, few benefits, and not enough pay to allow workers to build wealth.8 Meanwhile, most of the good jobs that are created will require a post-secondary education that is likely to remain out of reach for millions, as states continue to shift the cost of higher education onto students and families.
Even as inequality has worsened, national action has been lacking. Over recent decades, many political leaders have failed to reckon with a basic fact of the new economic era—for millions of Americans, no amount of individual effort or self-improvement or thrift can guarantee a secure middle-class life. The American social contract—a promise of opportunity and security for those willing to work hard—is fundamentally broken.
Dramatic new public policy initiatives are needed to accomplish two broad interrelated goals: to ensure that all Americans have a chance to move into the middle class and, second, to ensure greater security for those in the middle class. Such initiatives must move far beyond incremental measures, and be of sufficient scale to permanently address the economic insecurities of what is now a vast number of U.S. households.
 
To understand the impact of rapidly rising inequality on the American economy, there is no better place to look than the nation’s largest private employer, the world’s biggest public corporation, and a company whose customers and employees struggle on the opposite side of the economic divide from its owners. Many of Walmart’s 1.3 million U.S. employees raise their families near the poverty line as they contribute to the company’s $16 billion in annual profits. The primary beneficiaries of their efforts are the heirs of Sam Walton, who now hold more than 50 percent of the company’s public shares. Walmart’s business model has flourished over the past 20 years, with the growing economic insecurity leading to more price-conscious customers. However, in recent years, the company’s economic performance has stumbled, as a growing number of its U.S. customers—like its own employees—lack the purchasing power needed for sales to flourish. A company that played a leading role in exacerbating American inequality by compensating its employees meagerly and squeezing suppliers and competitors is now being undermined by the very economy it helped to create. This story is emblematic of the larger state of the American economy. But it also has a very human face.  
Patricia Locks has worked at a Seattle Walmart for 11 years and currently earns $13.10 an hour. Among Walmart’s front-line employees, she is far from the bottom, due in part to Washington having a minimum wage 27 percent higher than the federal minimum.9 A recent study from the National Bureau of Economic Research estimates that Walmart cashiers are paid an average $8.48 an hour, while the company has stated that its average wage is $11.81 for hourly workers.10
Yet Patricia Locks struggles. As is increasingly the case with low-paid workers, her schedule is unpredictable 11 but she usually works about 34 hours each week. She struggles to support herself and her 14 year-old daughter, but her unstable schedule prevents her from taking on a second job. Her monthly wage is $1,782, which is supplemented by food stamps ($15 a month) and child support ($371 a month). Many low-paid workers must rely on public benefits because employers pay too little for them to support themselves.12 Locks spends $780 a month on rent, $105 on personal care, $110 on utilities, $34 for health care and $321 for other expenses. That leaves her only $432 a month for everything else: school, paying off debt, food and doctor’s visits. 
Locks has thousands of dollars in unpaid medical debt, as do millions of Americans—a recent study finds that medical debt was responsible for 62 percent of all bankruptcies in 2007.13 She often has to skip doctor’s visits even though she’s been diagnosed with diabetes. Here too, her experience is common: a recent Gallup survey finds that three in ten Americans have forgone recommended medical treatment because of costs.14 Locks’ budget doesn’t leave her with extra funds to supplement her daughter’s education or let her participate in extracurricular activities. A recent study finds that the wealthy spend seven times more on enrichment for their children than the poor.15 All of these sacrifices are still barely enough to keep Locks from falling further into debt, another new reality for most Americans.
Patricia’s is not the only Walmart story, however. On the other side of the economic divide sit the six richest members of the Walton family, Christy, Jim, Alice, S. Robson, Ann, and Nancy, who have a net worth of $144.7 billion combined.16 Their great wealth stems not just from money they inherited from company founder Sam Walton, but from the ongoing revenue stream that Walmart’s operations (and workers like Patricia) generate. In the fiscal year ending in January 2014, the Walton heirs took home $3 billion in dividend payments from Walmart, enough to give a $2 an hour raise to the 825,000 company employees who make less than $25,000 a year.17 In 2010, when the family’s fortune was worth “just” $89.5 billion, it was already greater than the total financial assets of the least-wealthy 41.5 percent of American families combined.18 That six people could have more wealth than nearly half of American households without working for it is extraordinary—but unearned wealth is increasingly a part of the American story of success: six of the ten wealthiest American are heirs, not entrepreneurs.19 Recent data from Thomas Piketty finds that the wealthiest 0.1 percent make most of their income from capital ownership, not from labor.20
The picture of growing inequality between work and wealth epitomized by Walmart stands in stark contrast to the idea of America. Widely-shared prosperity is a signature promise of American society. It has made ours the most hopeful and dynamic country on earth and it is a foundation of strong democracy. Fortunately, in a democracy, Walmart’s business practices are governed by laws, laws which, if changed, could reshape opportunity for people like Patricia and her family.
The following sections describe the effect of inequality and the related rise of economic insecurity for most Americans at the household level.
In the years after World War II, as economic growth and productivity increased, the workers contributing to that prosperity saw commensurate gains in wages, across the income spectrum. However, that connection has broken down over the last thirty years: while productivity increased 65 percent in the three decades between 1979 and 2013, the inflation-adjusted wages of the median worker grew just eight percent, and that growth occurred exclusively as a result of the strong economy of the late 1990s, according to analysis by the Economic Policy Institute.21 Since 2000, the picture of earnings and income has become still more stark: despite a productivity increase of 22 percent between 2000 and 2012, inflation-adjusted median family income in the United States has declined  seven percent, from $68,949 to $64,053, over the same period.22
Part of the story is the increasing economic returns to education, which left workers without a college degree lagging further behind in income and employment. For example, as chronicled in Demos’ State of Young America report, in 1980, a young man with a bachelor’s degree earned roughly $9,100 more than a young man with a high school degree. Today, he earns $20,000 more, and the trends are similar among women.23 However, a college degree has not entirely protected workers from declining wages in the years since 2000. Between 2000 and 2014, the wages of young college graduates fell 7.7 percent, translating into a decline of more than $2,954 for full-time, full-year workers.24 This suggests that boosting college attainment, while critical, will not be sufficient to reduce inequality25 or re-establish the link between economic growth and productivity and wage growth.
A bigger part of the story has to do with the rising share of the nation’s gross domestic product flowing to corporate profits rather than wages and the larger share of overall income going to the highest one percent of income earners. Until 1975, wages generally accounted for the majority of the nation’s GDP, but by 2013 wages had declined to a record low of 42.2 percent.26 Research from Northeastern University finds that in the first seven quarters after the end of the Great Recession, American corporations received an astonishing 92 percent of the growth in real national income, while aggregate workers’ wages and salaries actually declined by $22 billion and contributed nothing to national income growth.27

Personal income has become far more concentrated among the richest, a trend that has also accelerated rapidly since the end of the Great Recession. Economist Emmanuel Saez finds that between 2009 and 2012, the incomes of the highest-paid one percent of Americans grew by 31.4 percent while the incomes of the rest of Americans grew by only .4 percent. In effect, the top one percent captured 95 percent of the income gains in the first two years of the recovery.28 Over the full period studied (1993 – 2012), real income growth for the top one percent was 86.1 percent and growth for the bottom 99 percent was only 6.6 percent. In total, the one percent captured 68 percent of income growth.
Finally, while the real wage data above is adjusted for inflation, this story does not fully account for the cost of health care, child care and higher education, which have seen their costs grow far more quickly than the Consumer Price Index. For example, the average annual employee contribution to health premiums has more than tripled since 1999, growing from $1,543 to $4,823 for family coverage and $318 to $1,081 for single coverage.29 The national average cost for center-based child care in 2011 was $8,900 for full-time care for an infant and $7,150 for full-time care for a preschooler.30​​​​​​​ Center-based child care fees for two children (an infant and a four-year-old) exceeded annual median rent payments in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.31 This is all the more troubling since according to the Center for Housing Policy, 22.1 percent of all working U.S. households (renters and owners combined) also experienced a severe housing cost burden in 2012, spending more than 50 percent of household income on housing costs, including utilities.32 Meanwhile, at public four-year universities, average tuition has risen 117 percent (in real terms) since 1993.33 The American middle class, and workers aspiring to a middle-class standard of living, are squeezed between stagnant and declining wages and higher costs for the fundamentals of a middle-class life. Aside from the major advances in health care coverage and affordability in the Affordable Care Act of 2009, policymakers have done little to address this new reality.
 
B. Priced Out of Upward Mobility
During the post-war industrial era, a post-secondary education was not required for a single breadwinner to support a family.  For example, in 1970 male high school graduates earned a median income equivalent to $45,432 in today’s dollars—32.5 percent more than they earn today.34 However, just as automation, de-unionization and globalized manufacturing began to put downward pressure on the wages and job opportunities of non-college educated Americans, state and federal policymakers allowed college to become less affordable to non-affluent families. Tuition at public four-year schools has more than tripled in the past three decades, rising faster than either inflation or growth in family income.35 The United States went from first in the world in degree-holders to 11th in the course of one generation.36 The enrollment gap between low-income families and high-income families is as high as it was three decades ago. Many hardworking students are priced out of pursuing and completing higher education—a fundamental component to upward mobility and opportunity in American society. And those who do enroll are leaving college with unprecedented levels of debt, often without a degree in hand.
A major factor in the rise of public college costs is declining state support for higher education. Demos’ report The Great Cost Shift finds that, despite appropriating $75.6 billion for higher education in 2010 (from $65.1 billion in 1990), states actually devoted less of their wealth to higher education than they did just 20 years ago. After controlling for inflation, states collectively invested $6.12 per $1,000 in personal income in 2010, down from $8.75 in 1990, despite the fact that personal income increased by 66.2 percent over that period.  As a result, between the 1990 and 2009 academic years, the real funding per public full-time equivalent (FTE) student dropped by 26.1 percent, falling from $8,608 to $6,360.  Funding levels are failing to keep pace with population growth, as the largest generation since the Baby Boomers has come of college age against the backdrop of a nationwide trend away from taxes and public investment. If states had provided the same level of funding as in 1990, total appropriations in 2009 would have equaled approximately $102 billion, an amount 35.3 percent greater than the actual one.37
Although increasingly large numbers of high school graduates enroll in some type of college, college completion has stagnated: today more than half of students who begin college never complete their degrees. Financial barriers are the primary reason why students do not finish college.38 The high cost of college is particularly prohibitive for students from lower-income families, and shifts away from need-based aid are only exacerbating the challenge. In 2013, just 32 percent of all federal student aid was grant-based, down from 55 percent in 1980. Similarly, in 2003-2004, the maximum Pell grant covered 87 percent of the costs of a four-year public college, compared to just 63 percent in 2013-2014.39

Rising tuition and limited financial aid has more students than ever financing their college education with debt and at ever-increasing amounts. In addition, students are struggling to meet rising college costs by enrolling part-time and working long hours. Two-thirds of community college students and 46 percent of four-year college students work more than 20 hours a week while attending school, greatly increasing their risk of dropping out.40
 
C.   The Debt-for-Diploma System 
Student loan debt is another area of growing economic concern. Due to rising college costs and diminishing grant aid, students are increasingly reliant on interest-accruing loans to pay for college, a dramatic shift in norms over the course of a single generation. In 2012, 71 percent of college seniors (at public or non-profit schools) graduated with debt, with borrowers carrying an average burden of $29,400 (up from only 33 percent of students in 1992).41 Graduates of for-profit schools are even deeper in debt: 88 percent graduated with debt and their average was $39,950 as of 2012.42 All told, borrowers now owe more than $1.12 trillion in student loan debt, a $124 billion dollar increase from last year.43 And there are increasing signs that student loan borrowers are becoming unable to repay this debt: 10.9 percent of all student debt is 90 or more days delinquent or in default (worth $122 billion).44 Already student debt is causing young Americans to delay building the financial assets that are necessary to middle-class security, including purchasing homes and saving for retirement.45 And the rising rate of defaults on student debt is impairing the credit of many Americans as well, making it more difficult to borrow or find employment among the nearly half of employers who now screen credit histories during hiring.46
The consequences of student loan debt can have a profound impact on the economy as a whole. According to Demos study, At What Cost?, $53,000 in education debt (the average amount held by a dual‑headed college educated household) leads to a net worth nearly $208,000 lower than if the household had not been forced to service debt used to pay for their college education. Over time, the indebted household will end up with a net worth 17 percent lower than a similar non-indebted household. Over the economy as a whole, the $1 trillion in total outstanding student loan debt will lead to $4 trillion in lifetime lost assets for indebted households, not even accounting for the heavy impact of defaults.47
 
D.  Wealth and Debt
Student debt is just one aspect of the overall divergence between compounding wealth for the rich and compounding debt for the average American. Wealth—home equity and savings nest eggs—provide a buffer against hard times and increase household economic stability, helping to fuel middle-class optimism and self-improvement. Household assets have a particularly powerful effect on how well children will do in their own independent lives.48
The wealthiest one percent have seen their share of American assets increase dramatically over the past three decades, and within that one percent, the top 0.1 percent has grown even more rapidly.49 Thomas Piketty estimates that in the United States, the wealthiest one percent control 33.8 percent of the assets, and the wealthiest 0.1 percent control 14.7 percent.50 In 1970, the similar figures were 28.2 percent and 11.5 percent. These estimates are likely to understate the wealth of the richest in our society, due to the increasing use of overseas wealth havens.51 Recent research by Philip Vermeulen of the European Central Bank confirms this.52 Vermeulen’s estimates would put the share of wealth controlled by the wealthiest one percent at 37 percent of all wealth in the U.S.53
On the other side of the equation, most Americans are increasingly burdened by debt. In recent decades, financial deregulation and the aggressive marketing of toxic loans preyed on Americans’ aspirations to build assets, fueling an unsustainable housing bubble that began to deflate in 2006. The bubble and the economic crash that followed decimated the wealth of American families, causing more than 2.7 million homeowners to lose their single largest asset to foreclosure and tens of millions of others to see their homes’ value drop dramatically.54 The crash hit those who had carefully saved and invested in their homes as well as speculators who gambled on a rising real estate market. Overall, the nation lost more than $6.5 trillion in home equity since the housing market peaked in 2006.55 At the same time, the value of retirement savings collapsed as the stock market plummeted, destabilizing hopes for a secure retirement. Not having enough money for retirement became Americans’ biggest financial worry.56 Even as Americans saw their assets diminished, the dramatic and long‑lasting rise in unemployment and underemployment contributed to Americans’ difficulty paying back their debts.
The prevalence of asset poverty in America is dramatic. The Federal Reserve, Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2013, released in July 2014 details the depth of the problem.57 Nearly half of survey respondents were not planning for retirement, and 31 percent reported having no retirement savings or a pension. Only 39 percent reported that they had a “rainy day fund” sufficient to pay for three months of expenses, and only half could pay a $400 bill without selling something or borrowing money. The Great Recession was a large factor; 57 percent of those who had savings before the recession said they had used up some or all of their saved money.
This degree of insecurity threatens to reverse one of the great policy victories of the 20th century: the creation of a middle-class senior citizen population. As a result of employers shifting from traditional defined benefit pensions to defined contribution plans, Americans’ retirement security is now more at risk than any time since Social Security was created. Only half of workers currently have any kind of retirement savings accumulated outside of Social Security.58  The vast majority of those who do are offered only the 401(k)-type plans that are an inadequate solution for retirement for multiple reasons. First, they are inordinately expensive. The fees charged by firms that manage 401(k) accounts can cost workers a quarter or more of their retirement savings. According to a widely-cited 2012 study by Demos, The Retirement Savings Drain, over a lifetime, these fees can add up to more than $155,000 in losses for the average household.59 In addition, 401(k)s are a poor substitute for traditional pensions because they place the burden of investment risk exclusively on individual workers. After working throughout their lives, older Americans relying on individual retirement plans could lose their life’s savings in a market crash, invest so conservatively that they ensure themselves weak returns, or outlive the funds they have been able to save. Pension-style plans, meanwhile, ensure security by spreading these risks among many plan participants over a long time horizon—no individual puts their entire retirement in danger. Yet in 2012, just 17 percent of private sector workers participated in a traditional pension as employers have opted for the low-cost 401(k) option instead.60
Instead of saving for the future, millions of working- and middle-class Americans are struggling just to service their debts. Demos has been chronicling the rapid rise in debt for nearly a decade: as wages stagnated and lagged behind the cost of living, Americans increasingly turned to borrowing—from credit card debt to loans against the value of their homes—to make ends meet and to try to get ahead.61 The deregulation of consumer lending that began in the 1980s meant that many of these loans included deceptive and predatory terms that were highly profitable for lenders but led to record bankruptcies and debt-to-income ratios. Lenders aggressively marketed high-interest credit cards with hidden fees, exorbitant payday loans, and costly subprime mortgages (even to homebuyers who could have qualified for a better rate—particularly if they were African American or Latino).62 While some of the worst practices unleashed by deregulation have been curbed by regulatory enforcement, the Credit CARD Act of 2009, and the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, Americans remain vulnerable to the hangover of the deregulatory experiment: widespread servicer and debt collector abuse.63
Even today, as credit card debt has declined post-crash, 40 percent of among low- and middle-income households carrying credit card debt still rely on their cards to pay basic living expenses because they do not have enough money in their checking or savings accounts, according to Demos’ own national household survey, The Plastic Safety Net.64 Credit cards are also widely used to pay medical bills and cope with spells of unemployment, in effect a high-interest way to make up for gaps in the public safety net.65
Another problem arises from the prevalence of employment credit checks. Despite a lack of evidence that personal credit history predicts employee performance or likelihood to steal or commit fraud, nearly half of all employers now conduct credit checks as part of their hiring process.66 As a result, job seekers with credit damaged as a result of medical debts, divorce, layoffs or identity theft are screened out of jobs they are otherwise qualified for. Employment credit checks disproportionately harm people of color because of damage done by predatory lending that continues to target communities of color, as well as the enduring impact of racial discrimination in employment, lending, education, and housing. The result is a vicious cycle: it’s hard to pay your bills if you can’t get a job, but unpaid bills may also prevent you from getting a job.67
Fortunately for these borrowers, smart regulation has recently made credit cards a better, fairer financial product for American consumers. The Credit CARD Act of 2009 has benefited millions of households in ways that directly affect their monthly budgets. A recent study by Sumit Agarwal, Souphala Chomsisengphet, Neale Mahoney and Johannes Stroebel find that the CARD Act has saved U.S. consumers $12.6 billion each year.68 Demos’ national survey found that the Credit CARD Act has empowered Americans to take control of their finances by increasing the transparency of credit card statements and dramatically reducing excessive fees and penalties.69 For example, the Act set new standards for clarity and disclosure in monthly billing statements. Credit card statements must now include information on how long it will take to pay off the current balance if consumers pay only the minimum payment amount each month.  Ninety percent of households in our survey report they have noticed the change and one‑third say they are responding to the new information included on credit card statements by paying their balances down faster. The CARD Act also offers consumers a reprieve from the assorted charges and fees that accompanied many accounts. In 2012, just 28 percent of households reported paying late fees—a significant decline from the one half of indebted households that accrued these fees in 2008. Of those who experienced late fees, only 29 percent saw interest rates go up on that card as a result, down from 53 percent in 2008, and only 14 percent experienced interest rate increases on their other credit cards. Finally, the Credit CARD Act virtually eliminated over-the-limit fees, previously one of the credit card industry's most abusive and profitable practices. Instead of denying transactions that exceeded a consumer’s credit limit, credit card companies used to process them and then charge consumers a fee—whether the consumers wanted to go above their credit limit or not. The Credit CARD Act requires consumer authorization for exceeding limits, virtually eliminating these fees.
The following section describes the effects of inequality on three economic goals—economic growth, mobility, and opportunity.       
 
The previous sections have detailed inequality’s effect on households, but it is worthwhile to note that evidence is mounting that inequality harms our nation’s overall GDP growth rates as well. Standard and Poor’s recently reduced its ten year U.S. growth forecast by 0.3 percentage points, citing “extreme” income inequality.70​ A 2011 International Monetary Fund (IMF) study by Andrew Berg and Jonathan Ostry finds that income distribution has a stronger impact on the duration of a country’s growth than trade, external debt and political institutions.71​

A 2014 IMF follow-up study finds that redistributing income doesn’t have a large effect on growth, and therefore increasing redistribution can be pro-growth (since inequality stifles growth).72​ This supports a growing literature on the subject.73​
The literature shows that when consumers don’t have money to spend, growth slows. Because the wealthy are more likely to save74​ than the poor and middle class, a higher concentration of wealth in their hands will stifle demand, cutting off the recovery. Even conservative Martin Feldstein, formerly the chief economic advisor to President Ronald Reagan, has recognized that economic growth has been stalled by inadequate demand.75 Further, two studies have linked increasing debt, driven by inequality, to credit busts.76 In their book, House of Debt, Atif Mian and Amir Sufi argue that rising debt has reduced consumer spending, weakening the recovery.77 Growth also reduces the ability of poor and middle-class people to develop important human capital, further endangering growth.78
A large literature shows that inequality also reduces upward mobility. In both international comparisons and within the U.S., higher levels of inequality have been tied to lower levels of mobility.79 Within the U.S., mobility varies widely by census tract, with the lowest levels of mobility in the south.80 Raj Chetty, Nathaniel Hendren, Patrick Kline and Emmanuel Saez find that within the United States, “areas with more inequality as measured by Gini coefficients have less mobility.”81 Internationally, countries with higher levels of inequality have lower levels of upward mobility.82 Miles Corak finds, “the United States stands out as being among the least generationally mobile among the rich countries, and in particular the overall degree of relative earnings mobility across the generations is almost three times greater in Canada, a country to which it might be most apt to make a comparison.” His curve, below, shows that countries with higher levels of inequality have lower levels of upward mobility. Alan Krueger dubbed Corak’s chart the “Great Gatsby Curve,” saying, “The fortunes of one’s parents seem to matter increasingly in American society.”83

A 2013 World Bank study examining an even larger sample of countries and using a slightly different metric of opportunity finds that “countries with a higher degree of income inequality are also characterized by greater inequality of opportunity.” 84
 

Inequality hinders mobility in numerous ways. As Alan Kreuger notes,
Children of wealthy parents already have much more access to opportunities to succeed than children of poor families, and this is likely to be increasingly the case in the future unless we take steps to ensure that all children have access to quality education, health care, a safe environment and other opportunities that are necessary to have a fair shot at economic success.85
There are myriad reasons why inequality reduces upward mobility. As inequality increases, the cost of falling behind becomes higher, leading parents to invest heavily in their children and possibly discourage public investment in other children through the public education system.86​​​​​​​ Higher income families spend far more money on enrichment (such as tutors, camps or private schools) for their children than can parents with fewer resources.87​​​​​​​ As inequality has increased in the United States, parents have spent an increasingly large share of their income on solidifying wealth.

Parents can also provide children with starter jobs, help pay off debts or support their children during an internship or low-paid starting position.88​​​​​​​ Martha Stinson and Christopher Wignall find that children in higher income deciles are far more likely to be employed by the same company that employs their father.89​​​​​​​ Nicolas Pistolesi finds that inequality of opportunity explains between 20 and 43 percent of earnings inequality in the United States.90​​​​​​​ In America, income distribution data show that it is now better to be born rich and not get a college degree than to be born poor and get one.91 Additional evidence against the reality of meritocracy is provided by a study by Richard Reeves and Kimberly Howard finding that, “a sizable proportion (43 percent) of those who remain in a higher-income household are of modest skill, and would be expected on the basis of skill to fall.”92
 
The following sections lay out five megatrends contributing to inequality’s rise: racial inequality, financialization, the loss of collective bargaining, underinvestment, and perhaps the most far-reaching factor: political inequality.
 
A major societal trend with implications for economic policy has been the rapid demographic change over the past four decades.  After the Immigration Act of 1965 removed race-restrictive entry quotas, the share of immigrants from non-European countries climbed.93 The white population was 83 percent in 1970 and 76 percent in 1990; it now stands at 64 percent.94 By 2043, whites will no longer be a majority in the U.S.95 Already, 46.6 percent of Americans under the age of 24 are not white.96
The country has only grown more diverse since the end of the Civil Rights Movement. American society has been experiencing rapid demographic change with only intermittent leadership attention to the challenges of coalescing a sense of common national purpose and identity out of a people with roots from every nation on the planet. While our discourse has recently embraced the idea that society can be color-blind, the facts belie the notion. In a 2011 Associated Press survey, 51 percent of all Americans expressed explicit anti-black attitudes, and 52 percent of non-Hispanic whites expressed explicit anti‑Hispanic attitudes.97 The incidence of unconscious prejudice, which can affect decision-making in ways that are hard to detect by the actors themselves, much less those who would enforce anti‑discrimination laws in the courts, are even higher. For example, Harvard University’s Implicit Association Test found that 88 percent of white people had a pro-white or anti-black implicit bias, and more than two-thirds of non-Arab, non-Muslim respondents displayed implicit biases against Arab Muslims.98
These implicit and explicit prejudices have real economic consequences for our diverse population. Approximately 3.7 million fair housing violations occur annually against African Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, and Asian Pacific Islanders as they seek to rent and purchase housing—yet HUD processed only 2,123 complaints in 2008.99 In financial services, after decades of credit unavailability due to private and government redlining, the 1990s and 2000s saw communities of color experience a wealth‑stripping phenomenon known as reverse redlining. Lenders and brokers targeted segregated neighborhoods with under-regulated financial products, particularly mortgages with features such as exploding adjustable rates, deceptive teaser rates, and balloon payments. Households of color were more than three times as likely as white households to end up with riskier loans.100 Federal policymakers and regulators declined to protect these communities for years as foreclosures rose, even acting to pre-empt state anti-predatory lending efforts in the 2000s.101​​​​​​​ The resulting loss of wealth—66 percent average loss for Latino households, 53 percent for African Americans compared to just 16 percent for white households102—stands as a grave and lasting blight on the future of our diverse middle class. For every dollar in assets that the typical white family owns, the typical Latino family has just 12 cents, and the typical African American family has only ten cents.103 African Americans are twice as likely as whites to have zero or negative net worth.104
A recent study105​​​​​​​ by Chetty, Raj, Nathaniel Hendren, Patrick Kline, and Emmanuel Saez find that, “income mobility is significantly lower in areas with large African-American populations.”106​​​​​​​  They find that racial segregation predicts lower levels of upward mobility. In a recent study, Bhashkar Mazumber finds that for children born between the late 1950s and early 1980s, 50 percent of black children born into the bottom 20 percent of the income scale remained in the same position while only 26 percent of white children born into the bottom 20 percent of the income scale remained in the same position.107​​​​​​​ This finding is confirmed by a recent Pew study108​​​​​​​ finding that blacks had lower levels of upward mobility of both income and wealth. They also had higher levels of downward mobility.


Education in the United States is increasingly segregated by race. A 2014 study from the Civil Rights Project at UCLA finds that in 2011, only 23 percent of black students in the south attended majority white schools, down from a peak of 44 percent.109​​​​​​​  Although there was progress in the late 1970s and ‘80s after lower courts began enforcing the desegregation holding of Brown v. Board of Education, this progress has stalled in recent years (although not been completely erased110​​​​​​​). Much of this slowdown in progress can be attributed to the courts removing oversight. A recent study finds that,
Over 200 medium-sized and large districts were released from desegregation court orders from 1991 to 2009. We find that racial school segregation in these districts increased gradually following release from court order, relative to the trends in segregation in districts remaining under court order. These increases are more pronounced in the South, in elementary grades, and in districts where pre-release school segregation levels were low.111​​​​​​​
The benefits of integration are well established. A seminal study by Rucker C. Johnson finds that desegregation “increased both educational and occupational attainments, college quality and adult earnings, reduced the probability of incarceration, and improved adult health status” for African American students.112​​​​​​​ Importantly, Johnson finds that the benefits primarily come from black students having access to the increased per pupil spending and smaller classrooms that white students enjoy. This is supported by previous studies on the subject, which link higher school spending to future student earnings.113​​​​​​​ The impact on earnings is particularly impressive; Johnson finds that five years in a court-desegregated school leads to a 15 percent increase in wages, an 11 percent decrease in the incidence of poverty and a $5,900 boost in annual family income. For white students, Genevieve Siegel-Hawley finds that diversity does not reduce educational outcomes for white students, but reduces intergroup prejudice and prepares students for a diverse workforce.114​​​​​​​
A recent Department of Education report finds a large salary disparity for teachers with high proportions of students of color: “Nearly one in four districts with two or more high schools reports a teacher salary gap of more than $5,000 between high schools with the highest and the lowest black and Latino student enrollments.”115​​​​​​​ Another study finds “schools with 90 percent or more students of color spend a full $733 less per student per year than schools with 90 percent or more white students.”116 These inequities are replicated at the college level. A recent report by Anthony Carnevale and Jeff Strohl find that college education in America consists of “a dual system of racially separate and unequal institutions despite the growing access of minorities to the postsecondary system.”117 They find that students of color are less likely to end up in the most selective schools than white students with the same qualifications.
Finally, numerous studies118 have shown that job discrimination plays a role in the higher incidence of unemployment among non-whites (while the seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate for whites is 5.3 percent, it is 11.4 percent for blacks and 7.8 percent for Hispanics).119 As just one striking example of this literature, a 2005 Princeton University study revealed that employers were more likely to offer a callback to white job applicants with criminal records than to well-qualified African American job-seekers with no criminal history whatsoever.120
 
The way that policymakers have chosen to structure the rules of globalization has contributed significantly to increased inequality over the past three decades. Our trade policies have been written and enforced in ways that advantage multi-national firms seeking lower-cost labor, directly resulting in fewer and lower-paying jobs for the American middle class. Increasingly, white-collar jobs are also moving overseas as China, India, and other nations field more educated workers who can do the jobs now done by U.S. scientists, accountants, lawyers, and doctors. As a historic champion of a more open global economy, the United States has often failed to take a hard look at how this system puts U.S. living standards at risk and develop policies to balance the prerogatives of multi-national corporations and the American middle class. Worse, the U.S. has often done little as other countries, like China and Japan, have played by a different set of trading rules that put the U.S. at a disadvantage. And we have repeatedly been silent in the face of abuses of worker rights, even when these abuses are perpetrated by close trading partners who are bound by Free Trade Agreements to uphold basic labor standards.
Over the past few decades, increased trade with low-wage countries has been responsible for fully a third of the depression in wages of non-bachelors degree holders relative to degree-holders since 1979; tracking just since 1995 (one year after the North American Free Trade Agreement came into force), low-wage country trade accounts for over 90 percent of the wage depression.121​​​​​​​

The downward pressure on wages affects not just workers who are directly competing with foreign production workers. When multi-national firms layoff American manufacturing workers in favor of less expensive employees in our trading partner countries, these laid-off workers compete for lower-paying jobs in non-offshorable sectors, such as landscaping or food service.122​​​​​​​ Thus the effect of our trade policy ripples throughout the working and middle class, beyond just those directly affected by plant closings.
The broader economic dynamic of high corporate profits amidst weak job growth and declining wages for most Americans is in large part a result of our global trade policies.  The North American Free Trade Agreement turned a slight trade surplus with Mexico into the current almost $100 billion deficit, which has cost nearly 682,900 jobs.123​​​​​​​  The permanent normalization of trade relations with China has cost over two million American manufacturing jobs between 2001 and 2011.124​​​​​​​ Two recent studies suggest that globalization has been a major driver of inequality. David H. Autor, David Dorn and Gordon H. Hanson find that “labor markets whose initial industry composition exposes them to rising Chinese import competition experience significant falls in employment, particularly in manufacturing and among non-college workers.”125​​​​​​​ Mike Elsby, Bart Hobijn and Aysegul Sahin find that, “offshoring of the labor-intensive component of the U.S. supply chain as a leading potential explanation of the decline in the U.S. labor share [of national income] over the past 25 years.”126​​​​​​​
 
 
Another, less often-cited megatrend driving inequality has been the financialization of the American economy. The deregulatory movement that transformed consumer finance also revolutionized commercial and investment banking and trading in ways that have dramatically increased finance’s share of the U.S. economy, from 3.8 percent to 8.2 percent of GDP.127​​​​​​​ Financial sector profits have also increased as a share of total corporate profits, with the non-financial business sector transferring increasing income to the financial sector. Research from New York University’s Stern School of Business shows that, contrary to the claims that deregulation would lower costs, the cost of financial intermediation—the critical function of transferring capital from investors to productive uses in the economy—has actually increased since deregulation. This growth of the financial sector was not because of increased demand for financial services, which only grew by four percent in the last decade.128​​​​​​​ The reason appears to be an enormous increase in the sheer volume of trading.129​​​​​​​


The relative growth of the financial sector is not necessarily a problem if the services provided by the sector add commensurate value to the overall economy. With the cost of intermediation rising despite technological advances that should be increasing efficiency—and with economic performance worsening, particularly as measured by the employment recovery time post-recessions—it is becoming apparent that value is being simply reallocated to the beneficial owners of financial firms. This drains resources that could be put to uses that would increase the productivity of the overall economy and create jobs and wealth. Demos Senior Fellow Wallace Turbeville estimates that the excessive wealth transfer to the financial sector is in the range of $635 billion per year.130​​​​​​​ Numerous studies confirm that financialization mainly serves as a rent-extracting activity, rather than a wealth-creating one.131​​​​​​​
In fact, the growing financialization of the U.S. economy and its impact on publicly traded corporations has exacerbated inequality in a number of ways. A focus on “shareholder value” has trumped all other goals for the modern corporation since the 1980s—a shift that Wall Street helped usher in through a relentless search for profits that included leveraged buy-outs, mergers and acquisitions, and private equity deals, as well as a more aggressive quest for short-term trading gains. This narrow focus on the short-term bottom line has undermined American workers and the middle class by justifying any cost-cutting measures that can boost quarterly earnings, including layoffs, foreign outsourcing, eliminating benefits, and defeating union drives. Nearly all the forces typically blamed for rising inequality—globalization, new technologies, declining unionization—have had a more devastating impact on U.S. living standards thanks to Wall Street’s imperative to put stock price above all else. Two University of Massachusetts at Amherst economists find that financialization accounts for more than half of the decline in the share of national income accruing to labor.132​​​​​​​ Other studies support this finding.133​​​​​​​
 
 
Organized labor has traditionally played a critical role in slowing the tide of rising inequality. Unions bargain collectively for better wages and benefits for their members. But unions also raise compensation for workers they do not represent: a recent study by Bruce Western and Jake Rosenfeld finds that unions substantially boost compensation for non-union employees in addition to their own members by influencing non-union employers to raise wages in order to avoid unionization; by promoting norms of fair pay, and by lobbying for public policies that raise wages.134​​​​​​​ David Jacobs finds that, “the role that union decline has played in growing income inequality may actually be larger than many of the favorite explanations offered by economists, such as the education gap in the United States.”135​​​​​​​ In short, high unionization boosts the share of economic growth going to working people rather than to corporate profits or the very highest earners.

However, the percentage of Americans belonging to unions has declined steadily, falling by 44 percent between 1983 and 2012, so that today, just 6.6 percent of private sector workers belong to unions. Western and Rosenfeld estimate that the decline of unionization has contributed as much as third to the growth of income inequality among working men since 1973.136​​​​​​​
Union decline can be attributed to the growth of corporate opposition to unionization and the weakening of laws intended to protect employees’ right to organize. Today, the system meant to defend the rights of employees to form unions barely functions. Weak and slow-moving enforcement of labor rights allows employers to routinely violate the law by threatening and harassing employees who attempt to organize. An analysis of union elections from 1999 to 2003 revealed that when workers attempted to organize a union, 96 percent of employers mounted a campaign against their effort.137​​​​​​​ Three quarters of employers hired outside anti-union consultants. So while workers might wish to join unions, they often fail to persist in the effort after an intimidating one-on-one anti-union meeting with their direct supervisor once a week or more leading up to a union election (a tactic employers used in 66 percent of organizing campaigns), after their boss threatens to close down the workplace if workers decide to unionize (57 percent of organizing campaigns), or after those co-workers who most openly support the union are fired (34 percent of organizing campaigns).

As financialization has sapped resources from the real economy the government has pursued austerity policies that have further reduced national investment.  Infrastructure spending has plummeted to levels not seen since World War II and is set to fall even further.138​​​​​​​ Because the poor and middle class rely more on public goods, they suffer the most from our increasingly inadequate infrastructure.

Public investment is crucial to future growth. The economic boom in the 1950s and 60s relied on government investments in education (for example, the G.I. Bill), infrastructure (for example, the National Highway System) and science (NASA, for example). Now, education spending is declining at the state level,139​​​​​​​  infrastructure across the nation is crumbling140​​​​​​​ and scientific researchers worry about the fate of their projects.141​​​​​​​
Investments in science produce huge benefits, both in terms of well-being and economic growth. The Human Genome Project, for instance, cost $3.8 billion in public funding and has produced economic gains of $796 billion (that’s a return of $140 to $1).142​​​​​​​ The Internet, too, was a product of government research and has produced trillions in increased economic output and growth.143​​​​​​​
Our infrastructure is aging, and the American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that we will need to invest around $3.6 trillion by 2020 to move from a grade of D + to a B.144​​​​​​​ Numerous studies find that infrastructure investment brings about large economic returns.145​​​​​​​
Public investment spending provides immediate stimulus and productivity growth in the future. A major Demos/Century Foundation/Economic Policy Institute fiscal analysis, Investing in America’s Economy: A Blueprint for Economic Recovery and Fiscal Responsibility, estimates that if the U.S. had begun investing about $250 billion a year into infrastructure in 2011, GDP growth each year would be one percentage points higher in 2021 and five percentage points higher by 2025. By 2045, nominal GDP would be by 11.6 percent higher than baseline projections.146​​​​​​​
 
We have reviewed the data showing that inequality has detrimental effects on our society and how intentional policy shifts, not inevitable contingencies, are primarily responsible. Meanwhile, evidence abounds that the U.S. political system is increasingly dominated by wealthy interests, and strong, bi-partisan majorities of the public believe the deck is stacked against ordinary voters.147​​​​​​​ What is less understood, however, is the interplay between these two problems and how a growing chasm of income and wealth translates into diminished opportunities for most Americans.
As Demos outlines in our foundational report, Stacked Deck: How the Dominance of Politics by the Affluent and Business Undermines Economic Mobility in America, this tilting of political life toward those the well-connected and already-wealthy has served to undermine economic mobility as a whole. As private interests have come to wield more influence over public policy, with ever larger sums of money shaping elections and the policymaking process, our political system has become less responsive to those looking for a shot to improve their lives and move upward. This is in part because wealthy interests are keenly focused on concerns not shared by the rest of the American public and often oppose policies that would foster upward mobility among lower-income citizens, such as raising the minimum wage.
 
Significant differences between the wealthy and the general public exist in such areas as tax and budget, trade and globalization, regulation of business, labor, the social safety net, and the overall role of government. The general public is more open than the wealthy to a variety of policies designed to reduce inequality and strengthen economic opportunity, including: raising the minimum wage, increasing the Earned Income Tax Credit, providing generous unemployment benefits, and directly creating jobs. For example, as the table below reports, only 40 percent of the wealthy think the minimum wage should be high enough to prevent full-time workers from being in poverty, while 78 percent of the general public holds this view. Affluent voters are also less supportive of labor unions and less likely to support laws that make it easier for workers to join unions—even as research shows that unions are crucial to reducing inequality. Governors elected with strong support from affluent voters and business groups have prioritized tax cuts over funding for primary and secondary public education.148​​​​​​​

 
B. Unequal Political Voice
These differences in policy preference by class create distortions in our policymaking precisely because the affluent are over-represented among both donors and voters (not to mention lobbyists, media influencers and other categories with outsized influence in our political system). Working and middle‑class citizens are more susceptible to the disenfranchising effects of our needlessly bureaucratic system of voter registration, a system which leads to 51 million eligible Americans being unregistered to vote.

There is a large literature on the how low voter turnout influences policy outcomes. A recent study by William Franko, Nathan J. Kelly and Christopher Witko finds, “that where the poor exercise their voice more in the voting booth relative to higher income groups, inequality is lower.”149​​​​​​​ Policies to increase low-income voter registration— whether through new laws, such as federal Same Day Registration,150​​​​​​​ or through basic enforcement of existing laws such as the National Voter Registration Act151​​​​​​​​​​​​​​—would help increase their voice in the political process. In a different study, Franko examined three policies: minimum wages, anti-predatory lending laws and SCHIP (State Children's Health Insurance Program). Franko compared the adoption of these policies to voter participation rates across incomes and found that states with higher levels of inequality in turnout were less likely to pass legislation beneficial to the poor.152​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ Kim Hill and Jan Leighley find that higher class bias in voter turnout reduces social spending.153​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ Another study finds, “an enduring relationship between the degree of mobilization of lower-class voters and the generosity of welfare benefits.”154​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ These results are predictable: studies show that legislators respond more to voters than to non-voters.155​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ A recent study finds that states with recent increases in turnout among voters of color were the most likely to have voter suppression laws proposed.156​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ Research shows that these laws bias the electorate towards more upper-class turnout.157​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ These findings indicate that voter ID laws are used strategically to reduce the turnout of low-income voters and voters of color.
Non-wealthy Americans are even less likely to contribute to political campaigns. Just 0.07 percent of the U.S. population made campaign donations of $2,500 or more in 2012, yet this group contributed a total of $1.4 billion to both presidential candidates.158​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ In contrast, the total of contributions from a much larger pool of donors contributing between $200 and $2,500 was just $485.7 million.159​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ The donor pool does not reflect the electorate’s diversity. Over 90 percent of donations in the 2012 election came from majority white neighborhoods while only four, three and less than one percent came from Latino, African‑American and Asian neighborhoods respectively.160​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ Money buys access, and recent studies indicate that donors are far more likely to secure a meeting with a congressmember.161 Access, in fact, is the main motivation of most political spending.162 This unequal political voice distorts elected officials’ representation of citizens’ actual policy views, given how many non-affluent Americans favor policies to create new pathways to the middle class.
For example, despite the important role a strong minimum wage plays in economic mobility, Congress has allowed the wage to decline steadily in real terms over the past four decades. (Meanwhile, it has repeatedly lowered capital gains tax rates to benefit the wealthy, despite majority opposition to preferential treatment of wealth income over work income).163 Even with the series of minimum wage increases, adjusting for inflation shows that the real value of the federal minimum wage fell roughly 30 percent since 1968. If the minimum wage increased at the same rate as inflation, it would be equal to $10.69 per hour, far above the current $7.25.164
This slide in the minimum wage should be no surprise when one takes a close look at the data on lobbying expenditures. The data suggests that low-wage workers have very few paid advocates in the corridors of Washington. Labor unions often speak up for these Americans, but otherwise, lobbying by groups that explicitly advocate for low-wage workers or non-elderly low-income people is so small that it doesn’t even merit its own category in records compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. This lobbying imbalance exacerbates the problem of elected officials being accountable to wealthy campaign contributors by ensuring that once in office, these officials are exposed to a constant flow of information supporting the donor class’ views and positions.
The most important study in this area is by the political scientist Martin Gilens, Affluence and Influence: Economic Inequality and Political Power in America. By comparing the policy preferences of different income groups with actual policy outcomes, he was able to determine how much influence different groups have had over policy. In a recent update to his original study, Gilens writes with Benjamin Page, “Not only do ordinary citizens not have uniquely substantial power over policy decisions; they have little or no independent influence on policy at all...By contrast, economic elites are estimated to have a quite substantial, highly significant, independent impact on policy.”165 Their data suggests that the wealthy have 15 times the influence of the middle class. Larry Bartels, using data from the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) finds that,
In the other affluent democracies, net support for spending cuts was virtually constant across income groups, from the very poor to the very affluent. In the United States, however, poor people were only slightly more likely to favor than to oppose spending cuts, while affluent people were vastly more likely to favor spending cuts. No other rich country even came close to matching this level of class polarization in budget-cutting preferences.166
Gilens shows that, in many cases, public policy outcomes would have been quite different if Congress and the president had been equally responsive to all income groups.
 
Reversing the trend towards greater inequality in America and shoring up a middle class that fully reflects America’s diversity will require policies that:
 
To achieve and preserve these reforms, we must also limit the influence of money in politics. One critical way to reduce the disproportionate influence of the wealthy on public policy is to create a system for financing election campaigns that lives up to the idea of one-person, one-vote by leveling the playing field between rich and poor and giving every American a strong voice. Such a system requires several key reforms:
 
A legitimate government “of the people, by the people, and for the people” must vigorously promote and protect the freedom to vote so that all eligible persons can participate in self-government. But today, too many bureaucratic barriers still block the ability of millions of eligible persons to register and vote, and too many politicians are actively seeking to shrink the electorate with unnecessary and discriminatory restrictions on political participation. Reversing this trend entails:

"On April 12, 2018, a white store manager at a Philadelphia Starbucks in the Rittenhouse Square neighborhood called the police on two Black men who were there for a meeting and had not yet made a purchase. The men were soon arrested, escorted from the store in handcuffs, fingerprinted and photographed and held for approximately eight hours. The incident was video recorded and circulated online by a white customer. The video received millions of views, sparking protests at the Rittenhouse Square store and a global online conversation about discrimination in retail, often with the hashtag #BoycottStarbucks.1 The Philadelphia Police Department initially stated that the officers had done nothing wrong in arresting the men for trespassing at a Starbucks.2 Two days later, Kevin Johnson, Starbucks’ CEO, released a statement apologizing and calling the incident reprehensible.3 On April 17, Starbucks’ then-Chairman and Founder Howard Schultz called us to discuss how to prevent similar incidents in the future, and shared his idea of conducting a company-wide training on racial bias.4 Schultz asked us to act as advisors on this effort, which we agreed to do on a pro bono basis.
Click to download the full report
Our Approach to the Project. Although advising corporations on anti-bias training is not a role that either of us had undertaken in the past, we agreed to offer our guidance and feedback to Starbucks after a number of considerations. First, we were struck by the company’s approach. Within 24 hours of the incident in the Philadelphia store, leaders at the highest levels of the company had forthrightly recognized the incident as one involving racial bias, had expressed the company’s preparedness to confront the issue straight on and had made arrangements to visit the Philadelphia store and community where the incident happened.
Second, we recognized that Starbucks’ presence in thousands of communities coupled with the company’s sincere and unequivocal commitment to address bias and discrimination presented a unique opportunity to deploy and embed a model of corporate leadership within communities around the country by a well-recognized and respected corporation. We also believed that as advocates for racial justice, we had a stake in seeing an endeavor as ambitious as this succeed, so that more companies would lean into addressing the ways that racism impacts their businesses.
Finally, the incident created a moment of national, and even international, conversation about the persistence of racism in public accommodations. At a time when many powerful political and corporate actors have a stake in denying the existence of racism, we felt it was a positive contribution to the public narrative to hear a forthright recognition of the problem from one of the world’s most ubiquitous public-facing corporations.
We reached out to dozens of our allied organizations in the civil rights and racial justice fields5 and had conversations with local stakeholders, including the grassroots community leadership in Philadelphia and, eventually, Donte Robinson and Rashon Nelson themselves, to get input and ideas about what Starbucks should do.
From our earliest conversations with the team at Starbucks, we have emphasized that this crisis unfolded in the context of a decades-long struggle of African Americans for dignity, respect and treatment as full citizens in the public space. Some of the most transformative campaigns during the Civil Rights Movement – the lunch counter sit-ins, the Freedom Rides, the Montgomery Bus Boycott – were centered around the demand for equal treatment in places that accommodate the public. This battle culminated in the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which outlawed racial discrimination in public accommodations. That landmark legislation resulted in a transformation of segregated public spaces throughout the U.S. But the struggle for equal treatment in public accommodations has continued. High-profile cases involving restaurants like Denny’s,67 retail establishments such as Macy’s and Barney’s,8 swimming pools9 and more recently golf clubs and nightclubs, demonstrate the stubborn persistence of racism in public accommodations.
The formational identity of Starbucks is centered around the creation of the “third place” – not home, not work, but a public space where all are welcome and people can share “the Starbucks experience.” But the “third place” cannot exist outside of the history and reality of racism in public accommodations. Indeed, the ambitious vision of Starbucks’ founder to create a “third place” in which all are welcome engages, by its very terms, the history and contemporary struggle of African Americans for dignity in the public space. Thus, the awful, humiliating experience of Donte Robinson and Rashon Nelson in the Philadelphia Starbucks provoked a necessary discussion within the company about the need to confront the full dimensions of what it means to steward public spaces in our country.
It is our hope that the willingness of Starbucks to engage this difficult reality will inspire other public-facing corporate actors to do so as well.
A note on “Diversity,” “Equity” and “Inclusion.” Throughout this report, we use the term “racial equity” as the desired goal for the transformation process that Starbucks is undertaking. We define racial equity as both a process and an outcome in which decision-makers and participants in a system ensure that equal opportunity for success is real, taking into consideration how power dynamics between and among different racial and ethnic identity groups shape opportunity.
Racial and ethnic diversity is essential, particularly in decision-making positions, to achieve the kinds of inputs and perspectives needed for racial equity, as is meaningful inclusion of people from subordinated identity groups – beyond just the presence of these groups that diversity offers. In that way, diversity and inclusion are essential components of an ultimate goal of a racially equitable institution. While diversity encourages employment of individuals with varying backgrounds and experiences in the corporation, it does not guarantee that those people will be fully and equally included in the fabric of the organization, nor that the company’s systems, practices and policies are designed to create racially equitable outcomes.
Once an institution accepts the premise that all people, regardless of their background, have the potential to thrive and contribute to the success of an organization, they can begin to recognize systemic disparities and gaps (for example, a mostly white leadership team, or lower retention for employees of color) as flaws to be addressed within a system that, like most all systems in the United States, has been infected with the bankrupt ideology of racial hierarchy and bias.
The exciting work begins when leaders move from passive acceptance of the disparities so common in our society to recognizing that a system that was created by human actors can be unmade by human actors, one institution at a time.

"Hard-working New Yorkers need time to care for their families without the pressure of missing a paycheck or losing their job. Whether it's the precious first months of a baby's life, the final days of an aging parent, or the critical weeks of recovery from a spouse's serious illness or accident, when a loved one needs care, New Yorkers need the time to be there for them.
Today, however, the United States remains one of only two countries in the world — the other is Papua New Guinea — to lack a national, paid family leave system. As a result, states such as California, Rhode Island, and our neighbor New Jersey have already taken matters into their own hands, creating state-run family leave insurance programs that provide real benefits to millions.

"For all the talk about saving Social Security for today's young workers, there has been surprisingly little attention paid to a major discrepancy in the apparent youth consensus for privatization.
Why is our generation the only one to simultaneously support President George W. Bush's most radical domestic policy agenda -- 55 percent to 42 percent according to a recent USA Today poll -- and back John Kerry for president? A closer look at our values may help make sense of the puzzle.
Conservative organizations have touted the fact that two-thirds of us don't think Social Security will survive to benefit us as proof of the system's failure. Yet the only thing our doubts prove is that we've gotten the message. Under attack throughout our lifetimes, Social Security is the cornerstone of a ""big government"" declared dead just as most of us began paying taxes. The assault on the program is part of a successful 30-year campaign that has shaped the world we've come of age in.
Free-market policies and anti-government rhetoric have bred a New Economy that we know full well means less security and more risk. Less than half of my generation has health benefits at work, and those lucky enough to get retirement benefits contribute to 401(k)s that, unlike defined-benefit plans, make no guarantees in return. We're right to be doubtful about the future of a social insurance program in the go-it-alone America we've inherited.
We're also right to be worried about retirement security. The data show that retirement wealth has fallen for all but the wealthiest Americans over the past 20 years, but young people don't need to see the numbers. We already see our parents approaching retirement paying second mortgages and cashing out 401(k)s to help us pay for college. And that's not to mention our grandparents, who have all the social contract benefits we may never get -- union pensions, employer health benefits and full Social Security checks -- but are still going into credit-card debt to keep up with costs of a health care marketplace run amok. The only certainty of our young lives has been that public policy will abdicate responsibility to the market time and time again.
Enter the rhetoric of Bush's Ownership Society, which walks and talks like a government solution to the shedding of benefits on the job. ""Adding"" private accounts to Social Security sounds like guaranteeing everyone a 401(k)-type pension that the government will hold safe for you, no matter how many companies hire or fire you. And in fact, the Universal Retirement Savings Accounts proposed by congressional Democrats and President Bill Clinton in the late 1990s would have been just that: progressive ways for the 49 percent of working Americans without employer pensions to save on top of Social Security.
Of course, the reality of the administration's privatization proposal is much less comforting, and if the whole truth were told, our support would undoubtedly dry up. When the reality of private accounts was explained to young adults in a new Rock the Vote-AARP poll, young respondents rejected them outright. We didn't want the guaranteed benefit to be cut for anyone (as it would be, by as much as 40 percent for the average earner under the administration plan, according to the Center for Economic Policy Research).
Those young survey respondents' reluctance to deliver the death knell to Social Security is a telling reflection of our generation's moral values (yes, we have them). The children of the New Economy have responded to the economic disparity and social insecurities in our schools, neighborhoods and workplaces with a backlash against government bashing.
According to a 2002 Kaiser Family Foundation poll, to a greater degree than any other age group, a majority (69 percent) of 18- to 29-year-olds want bigger government with more services, and 63 percent believe that government ought to do everything possible to improve the standard of living for all Americans. To a greater degree than our elders, we trust the government to do what is right most or all of the time.
That trust appears to be greatly misplaced in an administration that would fabricate a crisis and offer a false solution that could make retirement even more risky and economically stratified in the future. By couching his plan in ""Save the Children"" language, the president is obviously hoping that our generation will support privatization without too much curiosity about the consequences.
Democrats, meanwhile, are missing an opportunity to rally a generation of their faithful. They could easily explain the dangers of privatization to us without ceding innovation to conservatives. They could offer a bold plan for portable benefits, such as governmentseeded universal retirement savings accounts paid for with a tax on the wealthiest estates. Such a solution would recognize both the free-market economy we've inherited and our pro-government, common-solutions values, which have been shaped in reaction to it.",media
"The American middle class did not create itself in the 20th century. Rather, a post-war model of robust public investment in our nation’s people and institutions (despite high deficits) led to unprecedented shared prosperity. But if current trends continue, the middle class may not be recreated in the 21st century.

Average American families are losing jobs, benefits, income and wealth, and for the first time, the majority of Americans believe their children will not be better off than them. The debate over our fiscal future provides an opportunity to chart a new course, one that will reverse the decline of the middle class.
It is against this backdrop that Dēmos has measured the comparative effectiveness of five leading fiscal proposals. We evaluate the plans in eight categories: jobs and public investment; health care affordability; Social Security income; education; defense policy; fair and adequate revenues; and long-term debt reduction.
The highest-scoring plans prioritize immediate stimulus over deficit reduction in order to put millions of Americans back to work. They address the long- term debt problem by modernizing the revenue base and reducing unnecessary spending while investing in our future prosperity. For there are many ways to bring the federal budget into balance, but only a few proven ways to create a middle class.",policy-briefs
"How the Act will bring greater security to American consumers, investors and Main Street businesses.
Today, the Senate voted to pass the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, sending the landmark legislation to President Obama's desk for signature next week. The bill is not perfect, but it will bring greater security to American consumers, investors and Main Street businesses. Most importantly, it turns the page on an era of misguided deregulation that has cost Americans 8 million jobs and trillions in lost household wealth. Demos has contributed to the reform effort with policy analysis and advocacy on three major issues:
The bill establishes the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), an independent federal entity housed within the Federal Reserve, with the sole mission of protecting consumers from unfair, deceptive and illegal practices in the lending market. Demos was one of the first public supporters of an independent consumer finance regulator. The CFPB will consolidate the consumer protection responsibilities of as many as seven federal agencies under one roof. It will have independent leadership and funding, and the authority to write and enforce rules to address the tricks and traps now commonplace in Americans' checking accounts, mortgages, credit cards, and student loans. The new law gives states the authority to go beyond CFPB rules to prevent a local problem from becoming a national disaster. And it creates common-sense standards for fairness in mortgage lending, such as a requirement that borrowers can afford their loans and a ban on prepayment penalties and broker kickbacks for steering borrowers into higher-cost loans than they qualify for.
The Demos policy brief Why We Need an Independent Consumer Financial Protection Agency Now, recounts the history of financial deregulation at the state and federal levels, connecting this policy to increased family economic security and the current economic crisis. The brief also answers some of the Frequently Asked Questions about a new consumer regulator. The release resulted in coverage of the CFPA by Bob Herbert in the New York Times and by Chris Hayes on The Nation's The Breakdown podcast .
A Stronger Economic Foundation for the Next Generation. Risking Our Future Middle Class: Why Young Americans Need Financial Reform published in partnership with The Student PIRGs and the United States Student Association, made the case that the generation of adults just entering the workforce has an enormous stake in rebuilding the regulatory framework needed to avoid future economic crises and protect consumers. An earlier brief released with the same partner organizations, Subpriming Our Students, highlighted the burden of unregulated private student loans, which typically have uncapped, variable interest rates that are highest for those who can least afford them, and are nearly impossible to discharge in bankruptcy. Under the new reform bill, the CFPB will have the power to write rules for all private student loans. The new law also creates a private student loan ombudsman at the CFPB, charged with assisting borrowers, analyzing complaints and making policy recommendations to Congress and the Administration.
A Setback for Consumers: Auto Loans. One glaring shortcoming in the legislation is the special interest carve-out from CFPB oversight for auto dealers who sell or broker loans, consistently the top source of consumer complaints to the Better Business Bureau and state consumer protection agencies. Car buyers of color and military personnel are routinely targeted for interest rate ""markups"" and other loan scams. Furthermore, as demonstrated in Auto Race to the Bottom: Free Markets and Consumer Protection in Auto Finance by Demos Board member and Cambridge Winter Center for Financial Institutions Policy president Raj Date, exempting auto dealers from CFPB rules will artificially squeeze community banks and credit unions that also supply auto loans to customers into an even smaller share of the market, resulting in lower customer satisfaction and higher financing costs. Dmos helped coordinate a Hill briefing to educate congressional staff on this critical issue. Although the auto dealer industry was able to secure their exemption from the CFPB, the legislation does grant the Federal Trade Commission enhanced authority to act much more quickly to protect consumers from unfair and deceptive practices in abusive auto lending.
 
Nowhere was the breakdown of our financial system more patent than in the failure of the major credit rating agencies to uphold their primary role as independent arbiters of risk. It was their seal of approval that enabled Wall Street to develop a multi-trillion-dollar market for bonds resting on a foundation of unaffordable loans and inflated housing prices. Demos Senior Fellow James Lardner addressed the core conflict of interest that arises from ratings agencies seeking payments from the Wall Street firms whose securities they rate in Reforming the Rating Agencies: A Solution that Fits the Problem. The report recommended the creation of an independent clearinghouse that would receive rating applications from securities issuers and assign each job to a rating agency in a random or unpredictable way, eliminating the perverse incentives that result in high ratings over accurate ones. Sen. Al Franken (D-MN) introduced an amendment based on the Demos proposal, and the Franken amendment passed the U.S. Senate on a bipartisan vote of 64-35. After a tough conference battle, the final Act requires the SEC to enact the Franken proposal or an alternative that eliminates this conflict of interest after a two-year study.
The Act also includes a number of other worthy provisions to strengthen the oversight and regulation of credit rating agencies: For the first time, the SEC will have an Office of Credit Ratings with the authority to write rules and levy fines. Investors will now be able to recover damages in private anti-fraud actions brought against rating agencies for gross negligence in the rating. And raters must apply ratings consistently for corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and structured finance products and instruments.
 
After decades of deregulation, America's financial industry has grown riskier, more interconnected, and more concentrated. To make the case that the financial meltdown demanded bold structural reform, Demos released a series of reports on bank risk: A Brief History of the Glass-Steagall Act, Six Principles for True Systemic Risk Reform, and Bigger Banks, Riskier Banks, authored by Heather McGhee and Senior Fellows James Lardner and Nomi Prins. Unfortunately, the Act falls short of creating a 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act to separate the commercial banking that is critical to our economy (and supported by the federal safety net) from excessive speculative risk. Nor does the bill limit the size of the largest banks, as the Brown-Kaufman amendment would have accomplished with a 2% GDP cap on non-deposit liabilities. Nevertheless, the bill includes some important first steps. Demos' Heather McGhee contributed to the policy development and response on these issues, serving as Americans for Financial Reform's Chair for Systemic Risk and Resolution Authority. Her analysis of systemic risk issues, including the Volcker Rule and shadow bank regulation, appeared in TIME, Politico, USA Today, the Washington Post and on MSNBC's The Ed Show, among other outlets.
Highlights of the Act's approach to systemic risk include the Merkley-Levin amendment's stronger version of the Volcker Rule. The rule ensures that banks do not make risky ""proprietary"" bets for their own accounts with taxpayer-backed deposit funds, and limits bank investment in private leveraged funds. Proprietary trading and private fund speculation introduces needless volatility into our core credit markets, puts banks in conflict with their clients and diverts bank capital away from loans to America's small businesses and families. Senator Scott Brown (R-MA) was able to win a carveout in the Volcker Rule's original private fund ban to allow banks to continue to own these funds, and invest up to 3% of their capital in them. However, banks have to set aside in capital reserves amounts equal to their investment in these funds and are prohibited from bailing them out. The Merkley-Levin provision also bans firms from packaging risky securities for customers and then betting that they will fail, a practice at the center of the recent Goldman Sachs SEC fraud case.
The Act also creates a council of regulators to monitor systemic risk and, through the Kanjorski Amendment, empowers the council to break up banks that pose a grave threat to the economy. For the first time, it requires regulators to impose higher capital, leverage and liquidity standards on the largest, riskiest financial firms and creates bank-like oversight for large, interconnected ""shadow bank"" financial companies like AIG, GE Capital and mortgage financers that were at the center of the crisis. Unfortunately, the final bill includes a last-minute Senate amendment that unnecessarily allows any financial firm with more than 15 percent of its assets or revenue from commercial activities to escape oversight from the systemic risk council, no matter the threat the firm could pose to the economy. The Act also fails to impose statutory limits on the leverage, or debt, of a financial firm. To address the dangerous degree of interconnection on Wall Street (through derivatives contracts, repurchase (""repo"") agreements and other non-deposit funding), the Act imposes limits on bank exposure to any single financial counterparty or to their own affiliates.
 
The Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is only the beginning of the work that needs to be done to rebuild our regulatory structure. Demos will continue to work with policymakers, experts, advocates and engaged citizens to provide timely research to inform the regulatory process. We will also continue to make the case for structural reforms to ensure that the financial sector helps create, not undermine, broadly-shared prosperity for American families and businesses.",research

"The time has come for the creation of a Consumer Financial Protection Agency. For thirty years, Washington has been captive to a governing philosophy that eschewed regulation in almost any form, arguing that the hand of government was best kept behind its back. But the era of deregulated finance has shown that without public structures to ensure accountability and fairness, the system can not sustain itself. The result of this failed experiment in deregulation has been a crisis costing Americans $11 trillion in family wealth, $14 trillion in taxpayer bailouts and over 8 million jobs.
 
A: The Consumer Financial Protection Agency must be independent and fully empowered with the structure and authority needed to create and enforce fair rules of the road for consumer financial products. The Agency would have independent rulemaking authority applying to all financial products, regardless of the charter of the institution offering it. Likewise, it would have examination and enforcement authority over banks and non-banks, with examination and enforcement staff on its own payroll. The CFPA will be responsible for enforcing a range of consumer protection laws as well as addressing any unfair and deceptive practices. In order to avoid budget pressures or rider provisions, the Agency's budget must be funded by assessments, or some other independent source other than appropriations.
It is equally important that the Agency head be independently appointed by the president for a specified term and not subject to supervision by another regulator, person or board. Indeed, the CFPA's rulemaking, examination and enforcement authority, as well as all management and budget decisions, must not be subject to veto or approval by any prudential regulator or other person or board. The Agency must have a clear, uncompromised and independent focus on protecting consumers. This is the only way we will succeed in cracking down on abuses, strengthening our financial system, and preventing another financial crisis.
 
Today, regulated banks already face two separate examinations from their prudential regulator (for example, the OCC)-one from the safety and soundness examiner, and one from the consumer protection examiner. Despite claims to the contrary, CFPA examinations will result in no additional examinations; the CFPA examiner will simply take the place of the existing consumer protection examiner. However, issuers of consumer financial products that currently lack regulatory oversight-such as payday lenders, mortgage finance companies and brokers-will be subject to greater accountability. This lack of accountability led to widespread consumer abuses and was at the root of the financial crisis.
 
As part of comprehensive financial regulatory reform, the CFPA will actually streamline federal regulation. The Office of Thrift Supervision and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency will be eliminated and replaced with a unified national bank supervisor. Today, rulemaking, supervision and examination are spread across multiple agencies — the CFPA will consolidate these activities and eliminate redundancies.
 
No. To end to the era of loosely-regulated, unsustainable credit products, the CFPA must be a floor, not a ceiling, for state laws. Broad preemption of state consumer laws is a recent development (with key steps in 1978, 1996, and 2004) that can be directly linked to both the credit crisis and the rise in foreclosures and personal bankruptcies. State officials are more easily held accountable to the consumers in their state than are regulators in Washington. That is why federal preemption has historically resulted in weaker protections for consumers--and that is why the industry continues to fight for it.
Fundamentally, preemption is not about efficiency; it is about the substance of consumer protection. The bank lobby's claim that national firms will be crippled by a ""patchwork of state laws"" is disingenuous. Not only have national banks easily complied with state laws for most of the 150 years they have existed, but states can and do enact uniform laws for widespread problems, such as the successful 49-state adoption of Uniform Mortgage Broker Licensing laws in 2008. Even with a Consumer Financial Protection Agency, Americans will continue to demand faster action to counter new industry abuses than a single federal regulator can accomplish.
 
The CFPA will increase consumer choice by ensuring that lenders offer customers not just the riskiest product that will reap the highest fees, but the most affordable product for the customer. Offering customers higher-priced loans than they qualified for through steering, broker kickbacks and dealer markups was a hallmark of the recent deregulated era. As a result, toxic, unsustainable loans crowded out better alternatives, and the uneven regulatory playing field ensured a race to the bottom. For example, at the height of the subprime mortgage boom in 2006, risky loans had become so profitable to lenders that 61 percent of borrowers were steered into them even though they qualified for better loans. Americans will benefit from truly informed customer choice with a CFPA.
Finally, the industry should recognize that its customers no longer trust lenders to be fair and transparent. Like an outbreak of contaminated food, the deceptive practices that have flourished in recent years have a long-lasting reputation cost for lenders. A product safety agency can benefit the industry, helping restore America's confidence in the banking system.
 
No. Making the CFPA an office within a prudential regulator would be worse than the status quo. Any solution that gives a bank regulator veto power over the CFPA — an agency charged with protecting the public — would be like giving the Small Business Association a veto over workplace safety rules. Likewise, if the CFPA becomes an office within Treasury, it must have statutorily-guaranteed autonomy in rulemaking and enforcement, like the OCC does.
In the House, Walter Minnick (D-IA) sponsored an amendment to the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Financial Protection Act (H.R. 4126) to replace the CFPA with a council of existing regulators. However, the Minnick amendment failed because of broad recognition that consumer finance is too important — and the existing regulators too compromised — for a solution that would essentially perpetuate the status quo. Nevertheless, industry lobbyists have designed various less-effective alternatives to the CFPA and continue to find Congressional sponsors for their ideas. The 34 members of the U.S. House of Representatives that offered amendments to weaken consumer protections in the House financial reform package received $3.8 million in campaign contributions from the financial sector in 2009.",policy-briefs

"The ink had barely dried on the recommendation issued last month by New York Gov. Cuomo’s Wage Board — calling for a $15 minimum wage in the state’s fast-food industry — when corporate special interests in New York began sounding the alarm.
Consider the latest example: A Times Square billboard by a restaurant industry-funded advocacy group declaring underpaid cooks and cashiers undeserving of a raise because allegedly they have “no experience or skills.”
It’s a well-worn scare tactic meant to distract from the facts: 72% of fast-food workers in New York are adults over the age of 22, and nearly half have at least some college education.
But lobbyists for the fast-food industry aren’t in the business of spreading facts; they are paid to try and preserve the status quo, and from day one have argued that the sky would fall if workers are paid anything close to the living wage of $15 an hour.
The truth, of course, is that the sky has already fallen on America’s fast-food workers. Jobs that pay a living wage are virtually unheard of in the industry. And it’s precisely because companies like McDonald’s have driven wages into the ground for decades, as a concerted corporate strategy, that bold reforms like a $15 minimum wage are long overdue.

"How Main Street Partnership Banks Can Improve Local Economies
Across the country, states are considering proposals to move general revenue deposits out of the Wall Street banks that dominate the banking business today, and use them to capitalize a new local public structure with a mission to grow the local economy.

"Policy recommendations to reduce the related, self-reinforcing phenomenons of political and economic inequality. 
If there is one idea that nearly all Americans can agree on, it is that everyone should have a chance to improve themselves and do better in life. At the same time, Americans strongly believe in political equality—the view that civic life should be a level playing field and everyone should have a voice in the decisions that affect their lives. 
Yet today, there is wide recognition that America is not living up to either of these cornerstone ideals. A host of indicators show that the middle class is struggling—and worse, shrinking—and that upward mobility is elusive for many Americans. Meanwhile, evidence abounds that the U.S. political system is increasingly dominated by wealthy interests, and strong majorities of the public believe—rightly—that the deck is stacked against ordinary voters.
What is less understood, though, is the interplay between these two problems—the way that a tilting of political life toward business and the wealthy has served to undermine economic mobility. As private interests have come to wield more influence over public policy, with ever larger sums of money shaping elections and the policymaking process, our political system has become less responsive to those looking for a fair shot to improve their lives and move upward. Recent developments have aggravated this long emerging trend. In particular, the Citizens United ruling and the rise of Super PACs have expanded the ability of wealthy individuals and corporations to shape election outcomes and set the policy agenda in Washington and state capitals across the country. 
These inequities in political power would still be unfair, but might not matter as much, if the interests of the affluent and corporations were closely aligned with those of the general public. But this is often not the case. Wealthy interests are keenly focused on concerns not shared by the rest of the American public, like keeping taxes low on capital gains, and often oppose policies that would foster upward mobility among low-income citizens, such as raising the minimum wage. Even when the wealthy do share the public’s strong enthusiasm for policies that help Americans get ahead, such as spending on higher education, they often prioritize tax cuts or deficit reduction in ways that squeeze the resources available for these very policies. 
This paper offers an overview of the interplay between declining upward mobility and growing political inequality, which we show is a self-reinforcing phenomenon. It reports on a growing body of new research on this nexus and offers a set of policy recommendations to reduce both political and economic inequality.

"Corporations and unions face very different rules and requirements for their political spending. Labor unions must publicly disclose their political spending and, in some instances, face restrictions about seeking consent from their stakeholders before using political funds. Corporations do not face the same requirements. After Citizens United, there are many avenues through which corporations can spend money in politics without disclosing their financial support for particular candidates or causes. And corporations are not required to seek approval from their stakeholders—in fact, shareholders don’t even have the right under federal law to know if and how a company is spending money in politics.
This paper highlights the differences and broad implications of rules governing political spending by corporations and unions. It recommends Congress adopt a comprehensive disclosure regime like the DISCLOSE Act and the SEC meet its responsibility to update disclosure laws for corporate political spending in the wake of Citizens United.
In Citizens United v. FEC 1 the Supreme Court struck down the law prohibiting corporations and unions from spending money from their general funds to influence federal elections through independent expenditures or electioneering communications.2 Previously, they could use money given voluntarily from their members and employees to their political action committees for political spending. The resources available to corporations from their general funds for such political spending are vastly greater than those available to unions. The total revenue for all labor unions in 2013 (a tax category that includes agricultural and horticultural organizations) was $20.8 billion,3 while total corporate profits in just the 4th Quarter of 2013 was $1.9 trillion.4
Justice Anthony Kennedy’s majority opinion assumes this new political spending would be transparent and accountable, writing “disclosure permits citizens and shareholders to react to the speech of corporate entities in a proper way.”5 The opinion argues disclosure would be, “more effective” today because modern technology could make disclosure “rapid and informative.”6
Secret political spending has increased exponentially since Citizens United, exactly the opposite of what the Court’s majority posits when they rely on the presumption of transparency and accountability to reach their decision. Citizens United was decided in 2010, and by 2011 a study by the Center for Responsive Politics already found that “the percentage of spending coming from groups that do not disclose their donors has risen from 1 percent to 47 percent since the 2006 midterm elections.”7
Because, though the game has changed, the rules have not kept up. The rules that govern disclosure of political spending by unions were in place before Citizens United, but federal disclosure rules have not been updated to cover the new corporate political spending allowed by Citizens United. Federal rules require unions to publicly disclose all political spending and itemize payments over $5,000 with the date, name and address of the recipient, and purpose of the payment.8 Critically, this includes spending done through third party groups.
Corporations are under no similar blanket federal obligation to disclose their use of corporate resources for political purposes. They do not have to disclose political funds they route the money through other groups such as 501(c)(4) “social welfare” groups and 501(c)(6) business associations – and these tax exempt non-profit groups also are not required to disclose the source of their funds. 
Before Citizens United these dark money groups were not permitted to spend directly on federal elections,9 but now political spending by political nonprofits and business associations dwarfs spending by 501(c)(5) unions, which do have to disclose:
10
Without knowing the identities of the sources of the funds, it’s impossible to know how much of the $300 million dollars in dark money spent in the 2012 elections from organized business associations and newly politically active “social welfare” groups came from corporations, let alone which corporations. For example, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce spent $69,506,784 on elections in 2010 and 2012, without identifying the source of those funds,11 and was the biggest outside spender in the 2010 elections.12
Indications are that secret political money will only continue to rise until the rules are changed. At this point in July in the 2012 election cycle, dark money was already at an all-time high compared to the same point at any prior cycle—at about $11 million it was a three-fold increase over the 2008 presidential election.13 Already so far in the 2014 election cycle more than $34.6 million has been spent by organizations that do not identify the sources of their funds. This is three times the amount of dark money spent at this point in the 2012 presidential election and a shocking fifteen times more than was spent in dark money at this point in the last midterm elections in 2010.14
Moreover, most outside spending comes in a flurry in the last month of the election. In 2012, $184 million of dark money was spent on or after October 1st,15 which represents over sixty percent of the secret political spending tracked in that year. If these trends hold dark money totals this year will certainly break the 2010 midterm record and may even surpass the 2012 presidential election. As it currently stands, we will have no way of knowing the real identities of the political players funding these groups or how much money is coming from corporate sources.
No. Both unions and corporations have to report to the Federal Election Commission any political expenditures made to finance independent expenditures and electioneering communications. However, this covers only some of the direct political spending. Otherwise, the regulations governing corporate and union political spending are very different, and allow much more secrecy for corporations than for unions.16

The rules requiring disclosure of union political spending are comprehensive and apply to every union with total annual receipts of $250,000 or more. Federal law requires that unions disclose to the Department of Labor “direct and indirect disbursements to all entities and individuals . . . associated with political disbursements or contributions in money.”17 These LM-2 reports are available on the Department of Labor’s website.
Unions are required to report the money they spend not just in federal candidate elections, but also for state and local office, including judicial races. They are explicitly required to be transparent about spending to support or oppose ballot referenda or to influence legislation. In addition, they are required to report get-out-the-vote campaigns, voter education campaigns, fundraising and any politically-related litigation expenses. Crucially, their donations to 501(c)(4) groups, unlike the similar donations by corporations, must be disclosed on the Schedule 17 form.18
In stark contrast, the only agency to which corporations are required to report their indirect political spending is the Internal Revenue Service, and those reports are not made public. If corporations directly engage in political spending, they must disclose their independent expenditures and electioneering communications to the Federal Election Commission.19  But they can funnel as much dark money as they would like through 501(c) groups. Corporations may voluntarily disclose these contributions, but face no requirement to do so. Of the 100 companies that have chosen to make voluntary disclosures—a micro-fraction of all corporations—many disclose donation amounts, but not the destination of the money, disclose selectively and/or disclose in an untimely fashion.20
State disclosure laws are a patchwork and too often ineffective. But after Citizens United several states passed laws to strengthen their disclosure requirements for corporate political spending in state elections. For example, Maryland passed a law requiring companies that spend money to influence state elections to report the spending to their shareholders.21
No. For unions, nonmember workers that benefit from a union contract are able to request a refund of the portion of their fees that went to political activities,22 and in some instances the Supreme Court has required public sector unions to receive prior consent before assessing fees for political spending.23
Corporations are not required to get consent from their shareholders before the corporation uses corporate funds to support or oppose political candidates.24 Shareholders have no ability to approve or dissent from a corporation’s political spending, or receive a pro rata refund for spending with which they disagree. In the United Kingdom, shareholders vote on a political budget for the company;25 legislation has been introduced in the United States that would require shareholder approval for corporate political spending.26
In the U.S., shareholders don’t even have the right to know how a corporation is spending money in politics. Shareholders have no way to know whether the corporations they are invested in are engaging in political spending, and what they may be supporting without their knowledge. While problematic for a number of reasons, this is most notable for failing to provide the accountability the Supreme Court assumed would be present when it struck down the ban on corporate political spending in Citizens United. Justice Kennedy explicitly wrote that with the advent of the internet, prompt disclosure “can provide shareholders and citizens with the information needed to hold corporations and elected officials accountable.”27 But this accountability to shareholders doesn’t exist. In fact, many companies don’t yet have policies requiring that their boards of directors approve political spending by the corporation they control. 
This disparate treatment makes even less sense after considering that labor unions represent millions of workers collectively pooling their money to represent their interests and strengthen their voices, whereas business corporations are economic entities created to make profits and avoid liabilities.28 
In his book, Affluence and Influence, political scientist Martin Gilens looked at how closely the publicly declared preferences of various interest groups align with the policy preferences expressed by Americans.29 He found that policy preferences expressed by unions are aligned with the interests of Americans across the income spectrum.

 
Unions advocate for the positions more closely aligned with the preferences of working people, average-earning middle class Americans, and the relatively affluent (those in the 90th percentile for income). Gilens writes, “based on unions’ strong tendency to share the preferences of the less well-off and the large number of policy areas they are engaged in . . ., unions would appear to be among the most promising interest group bases for strengthening the policy influence of America’s poor and middle class.”30
His work also shows that organized business interests are among those least aligned with popular opinion. 

Political spending by unions even aligns more closely with the interests of shareholders than that of the profiled businesses and trade associations. After all, most of the shares of public companies are ultimately held by the general public through intermediaries, such as institutional investors charged with managing retirement accounts.
But our campaign finance and other laws and regulations, shaped by Supreme Court decisions, require that unions comply with many more transparency and accountability measures than corporations when they engage in political spending. Corporations are able to wield power through political spending without complying with the same disclosure or consent provisions that apply to unions. This is another way in which our current system stacks the deck in favor of the elite.31
On the heels of Citizens United, Congress came within one vote of overcoming a party-line filibuster to pass the DISCLOSE Act. The need for improved transparency has only grown more clear, and Congress should adopt comprehensive legislation to require disclosure of the true source of funds used for political spending. Voters have a right to know who is influencing their votes and currying favor with their representatives.
The Securities and Exchange Commission has a responsibility to respond to these specific changed conditions by issuing a rule requiring publicly traded corporations to disclose their political spending to their shareholders. This is part of the SEC’s core mission to protect shareholders and the integrity of the markets. Under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the SEC may require proxy disclosures as “necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.”32 There are important investor interests implicated in political spending, e.g., management agency issues, alignments between values, and risk to brand and shareholder value.33 Shareholders have a right to know how a public corporation is spending money, and they need to know in order to make informed investment decisions.
Many companies are facing shareholder demands for increased transparency around corporate political spending. It was the most frequently filed shareholder resolution in 2014 and 2013.34 Over 100 companies have entered into agreements with their shareholders to disclose certain elements of their political spending.35 And yet voluntary disclosure agreements can be difficult to enforce. For example, Aetna gave $7 million to two 501(c)(4) groups in 2012 but didn’t disclose their contributions even though they had a disclosure agreement with their shareholders.36
Leading investors are demanding a systemic solution. John Bogle, founder and former CEO of Vanguard has called for greater regulation of corporate political spending, saying “it’s time to stand up to the Supreme Court’s misguided decision; to bring democracy to corporate governance; to recognize the interlocking interests of our corporate and financial systems; and take that first step along the road to reducing the dominant role that big money plays in our political system.”37
Unions and corporations face very different regulations when it comes to their political activity. Unions are heavily regulated and are required to report any political spending to several federal agencies, including the IRS and the Department of Labor. Corporations are required to disclose only a part of their political spending and face no accountability even from their own stakeholders. While organized business is free to advocate for the policies they prefer, it is only fair that they do so with at least the same transparency and accountability rules that govern organized labor.",research
"Studies have shown that policy most reflects the preferences of the most wealthy members of society and that those preferences do not reflect the greater public opinion on issues including the economy.

The law, which will first affect elections in 2020, will steer millions annually toward the campaigns of local candidates and is aimed at reducing their reliance on deep-pocketed donors. [...]

"The Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision has made it even more difficult for minorities to affect politics with money, said Adam Lioz, political director for the left-leaning advocacy group Demos.
The Federal Reserve released data last year that found white families had more wealth than any other racial group, and the Citizens United decision expanded wealthy people’s ability to spend their money on politics in unlimited fashion.   
“There are a lot of people of color making strides, but a troubling racial wealth gap persists,” Lioz said. [...]
That’s why people such as Demos’ Lioz advocate for small-donor public financing as a way of equalizing political spending and including more people.

"Buckley, a 1976 Supreme Court case, set the structure of modern campaign finance law.
Buckley v. Valeo is a January 30, 1976 Supreme Court case that struck down key pieces of Congress’ post-Watergate money in politics reforms, and set the structure of modern campaign finance law.1 Buckley and the line of cases that followed—including 2010’s Citizens United 2—eliminated many of the strongest protections against wealthy individuals and institutions translating economic might into political power, and has helped sustain a vicious cycle of political, economic, and racial inequality that endures today.
Congress passed the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) in 1971, but then strengthened it significantly in the wake of Watergate in 1974.3 Plaintiffs challenged many of the provisions of these 1974 amendments, along with some of the disclosure requirements enacted in the original law.
Watergate is best remembered for the break-in at DNC offices at the now-famous hotel and subsequent cover up; but it was also a campaign finance scandal. Twenty-two individuals and 17 corporations pleaded guilty to charges related to illegal corporate contributions to President Nixon’s re-election committee and other campaigns.4 Outrage over these abuses fueled the 1974 FECA amendments.
The law as amended had five basic features: contribution limits, spending limits, public financing, disclosure, and enforcement. FECA limited contributions from individuals to candidates, parties, and political committees—both to each entity and in aggregate; limited the total amount that candidate campaigns could spend on a given election, as well as the amount that outside groups or individuals could spend for or against a given candidate; limited the amount that wealthy candidates could spend on their own campaigns; created a two-tiered system for public funding of presidential elections; required disclosure of all federal contributions and spending above a certain threshold; and created the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to enforce the law.5
We don’t really know. FECA was challenged the day after the 1974 amendments went into effect, and was never fully in effect for even one complete election cycle.6
James L. Buckley was a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C Circuit until his retirement in 2000, and is the brother of famous conservative intellectual William F. Buckley, Jr.7 In 1974, Mr. Buckley was a U.S. Senator from New York who was elected in 1970 as a Conservative Party candidate.8 Interestingly, Mr. Buckley spent approximately half of what would have been his spending cap under the new FECA amendments, while his (losing) opponent spent more than one and a half times the limit.9
Senator Buckley was joined in the suit against FECA by Eugene McCarthy, who challenged Hubert Humphrey for the 1968 Democratic presidential nomination on an anti-war platform, along with his 1976 presidential committee; Stewart Mott, a prominent anti-war donor who contributed more than $200,000 to McCarthy’s 1968 campaign and more than $350,000 to George McGovern’s 1972 campaign (nearly $2 million in 2015 dollars); the New York Civil Liberties Union; the Republican Party of Mississippi; the Libertarian Party and the Conservative Party of New York; two conservative advocacy organizations; a weekly newspaper called Human Events; and Republican Congressman William Steiger from Wisconsin.10
FECA opponents argued that contribution and spending limits always and necessarily violate First Amendment free speech rights because “[l]imiting the use of money for political purposes amounts to restricting the communication itself” and because the limits allegedly discriminated against challengers in favor of incumbents.11 Further, plaintiffs argued that “[p]rivate campaign financing does not…foster inequality of political expression” because “[l]arge contributions are made on behalf of the whole spectrum of political persuasion” and that the limits would “make American politics more unresponsive and…inevitably lead to an increase in alienation and apathy.”12
Plaintiffs argued that the public financing provisions were unconstitutional because “[t]here is no public interest in relieving candidates of the need to raise money to finance their political activities” and because they discriminate against minor party candidates who would qualify for less funding.13  Although they cited disclosure as the best remedy for corruption scandals like Watergate, plaintiffs argued that FECA’s disclosure thresholds were unconstitutionally low and the provisions would have a chilling effect on speech in support of minor parties and candidates.14 Finally, the plaintiffs challenged the structure of the FEC based upon the process for appointing commissioners.15

"CAMPAIGN FINANCE
Chiraag Bains, Director of Legal Strategies for Demos
“Do you believe that the Constitution requires that we allow corporations and wealthy individuals the unfettered ability to translate their economic might into political power through campaign contributions and expenditures—even if it drowns out the voices of working-class Americans and erects barriers to candidates of color who lack access to big money and the mostly white donor class?”",media
"For several years, Demos and our partners have been working to fulfill our Constitution’s democratic promise by forging a new legal order that is open to money-in-politics reforms, and marshalling the factual and legal arguments that could help the Court move in this direction. At Demos, we believe that to truly reverse course, a new approach should explicitly grapple with the value of political equality, and how American democracy is still undermined by our long history of race-based exclusion.

"McCutcheon struck down the limit on the total amount that one wealthy donor is permitted to contribute to all federal candidates, parties, and political action committees (PACs) combined.
McCutcheon v. FEC is a Supreme Court case in which a narrow 5-4 majority struck down the limit on the total amount that one wealthy donor is permitted to contribute to all federal candidates, parties, and political action committees (PACs) combined.
This “aggregate contribution limit” was already $123,200 over a two-year election cycle1—more than twice the average income for an American household.2  This was not enough for Alabama coal executive Shaun McCutcheon, who joined with Senator Mitch McConnell and the Republican National Committee to urge the Court to allow him and other wealthy donors to contribute a potentially unlimited amount.
 
Yes. With the Court’s decision in McCutcheon, wealthy donors may now contribute more than $3.5 million to a single party’s candidates and party committees (plus a virtually unlimited amount to supportive PACs).3  Demos projects that this will result in more than $1 billion in additional campaign contributions from only 2,800 elite donors through the 2020 election cycle.4
More importantly, this will shift the balance of power even further toward wealthy donors and away from ordinary citizens.  Without an aggregate limit, we estimate that in 2012 just 1,219 elite donors would have contributed nearly 50 percent more to candidates and parties than President Obama and Mitt Romney raised combined from more than 4 million small donors.5
Still in place, at least for now, are limits on the amount an individual may contribute to a particular federal candidate and party committee.  A wealthy individual may contribute up to $2,600 per election ($5,200 per election cycle) to a federal candidate, $5,000 per calendar year to a political action committee (PAC) that supports federal candidates, $10,000 per calendar year to a state or local party committee, and $32,400 per calendar year to a national party committee.6  But “joint fundraising committees” will allow members of Congress and party officials to solicit much larger checks from big money donors who can contribute to many candidates or parties at once. 
 
The Court asked the wrong question.7  For decades, when evaluating limits on the use of big money in politics, the Court has asked only one question: is this regulation necessary to fight corruption or its appearance?  The Roberts Court has defined “corruption”  very narrowly to mean only quid pro quo exchanges of money for official action (more on this below), and in McCutcheon Justice Roberts wrote explicitly about how other potential government interests are not legitimate reasons for limiting the use of big money.
But addressing the role of money in politics is not just about clean governance—it’s about shifting fundamental power dynamics in American society to facilitate meaningful representation for all citizens.  Even if we were able to eliminate all financial quid pro quo corruption from the electoral process, money would still exercise tremendous influence on elections and hence policy outcomes. Much more profound questions about the relationship between concentrated economic power and democracy are at stake. 
The Court should be asking whether it’s fair for the wealthy to use their economic might to purchase political power and whether one person contributing millions of dollars to candidates and parties is consistent with the principle of one person, one vote.  The Justices should be prepared to recognize other fundamental American values at stake, such as political equality, robust participation, and protecting the integrity of our democracy.
The Court doubled down on its Citizens United mistake.  In Citizens United the Court opened the door to Super PACs and unlimited political spending from corporations and unions because it held that so-called “independent” spending could not corrupt.8  In McCutcheon, the Court’s conservative majority repeated its Citizens United mistake and said there is not enough of a risk of corruption or its appearance from wealthy donors pumping millions of dollars into federal campaigns to justify total contribution limits.  This one-two punch has dealt a serious blow to our democracy.  As Justice Breyer wrote in his McCutcheon dissent, “Taken together with Citizens United…today’s decision eviscerates our Nation’s campaign finance laws, leaving a remnant incapable of dealing with the grave problems of democratic legitimacy that those laws were intended to resolve.”9
The Court narrowed the definition of corruption so severely that it now looks like straight bribery—which is already illegal.  As noted above, the Court should be concerned with much more than corruption.  In the past, the Justices at least recognized that our democracy can be corrupted by “improper influence and opportunities for abuse.”10  But the Roberts Court has been steadily narrowing the definition of corruption.  In Citizens United, Justice Kennedy wrote in the context of independent spending that “ingratiation and access…are not corruption.”11  Justice Roberts has now taken this narrow definition to the extreme and applied it in the context of direct contributions, writing that “government regulation may not target the general gratitude a candidate may feel towards those who support him or his allies, or the political access such support may afford,” but rather must be laser-focused on “a direct exchange of an official act for money.”12  It’s hard to tell how this is different from bribery, which is already illegal.  Such a narrow definition of corruption seems designed to make it difficult for laws that protect the integrity of our democracy to survive.
The Court assumes that money is speech.  Building off of past cases that have cast money as speech, Justice Roberts compares contributing millions of dollars to political candidates to flag burning or Nazi parades.  But, reasonable restrictions on political money do not regulate the content of anyone’s speech—candidates and outside groups are free to engage in rigorous critique of government officials or policies.  Rather, big money acts to amplify the voices of wealthy over their fellow citizens and allow the rich to act like bullies in the public square.  The Court plays fast and loose with this distinction between content and amplification to mask the fact that the five-justice majority seems concerned only with the speech of those who can afford to pump millions of dollars into campaigns.
As Justice Stevens has explained, “Money is property; it is not speech. . . . It does not follow…that the First Amendment provides the same measure of protection to the use of money to accomplish [one’s] goals as it provides to the use of ideas to achieve the same results.”13
The Court ignores that common sense money in politics rules promote First Amendment values.  Justice Roberts characterized the First Amendment as protecting only an individual’s right to “speak” as much he or she can, free from government restraint.14 But the First Amendment promotes more than just self-expression—one of its primary functions is to promote the accountability and responsiveness of government officials to the public as a whole, the hallmarks of a healthy democracy.15 Justice Breyer wrote that the “First Amendment advances not only the individual’s right to engage in political speech, but also the public’s interest in preserving a democratic order in which collective speech matters.”16
The Court doesn’t understand how politics works in the real world, and made no attempt to find out.  Justice Roberts’ opinion paints a picture of a world in which large contributions to candidates and elected officials do not skew policy or cause the public to question the integrity of our democracy.  This is clearly divorced from reality and from the common sense understanding most Americans, who believe that financial supporters have an improper influence on our politics and policy and consider this a corruption of democratic government.17  Justice Breyer noted that the conclusion of the Roberts majority “rests upon its own, not a record-based, view of the facts.”18  In prior campaign finance cases, there were hundreds of thousands of pages of evidence introduced to support the various sides’ views on the actual influence of money in politics.19  Although this case lacked such detailed record, Justice Roberts still concluded confidently that abolishing the aggregate federal limits would not help motivated donors get around base contribution limits.20  Historically, the Court has been somewhat deferential to Congress when it comes to making campaign rules because those who run for office have more expertise in this area; but the Roberts Court has shown no such humility. 
 
Elected officials will be even more responsive to the wealthy few who fund campaigns.  Recent research confirms that the very wealthy have starkly different policy priorities than the general public, especially on economic issues.21 This research also shows that the U.S. government responds differentially to the preferences of the donor class, even when those preferences run counter to those of the general public.22  When the richest 10 percent differ from the rest of us, the 10 percent trumps the 90 percent.23
This is largely because an elite “donor class” funds a substantial portion of campaigns, and he who pays the piper calls the tune.  In the 2012 elections, for example, U.S. Senate candidates raised 64 percent of their funds in contributions of at least $1,000—from just 0.04 percent of the population.24  This means that even the best-intentioned candidates often spend most of their time contacting a narrow set of wealthy donors and hearing about their concerns and priorities.25
In describing the four to six hours of fundraising calls he’s required to make per day, Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy noted that he wasn’t calling anyone “who could not drop at least $1,000,” who he estimated make at least $500,000 to $1 million per year. He acknowledged that this meant he was hearing far more about the concerns of the affluent than from people who worked on the factory floor.26
Americans across the political spectrum believe that money in politics is the reason their representatives are more responsive to private interests with financial resources than to the public interest27 and that this will continue to undermine faith in our democracy.
A smaller network of gatekeepers and “kingmakers” will narrow the pool of candidates.  To run for office successfully in our big money system, candidates need access to a network of wealthy donors.  Aspiring officeholders need to win the “wealth primary” before the voters have their say at the polls.  Because the donor class is more wealthy, white, and male than the population as a whole, this gives an advantage to people who run in similar circles.  The McCutcheon ruling will mean that an even narrower set of even wealthier donors can act as gatekeepers to more races across the country.  The most effective way to control the agenda in Congress and state capitols across the country is to control who runs for office and who wins elections.  Once wealthy donors have helped placed allies in positions of power, they don’t need to bribe them in order to secure preferred policies that serve their interests.
The Roberts Court has privileged the political participation of billionaires, while at the same time gutting protections for the freedom to vote.  The Roberts Court’s money in politics and voting rights decisions have helped the wealthy dominate politics while conversely limiting average citizens’ freedom to vote. On one hand, the McCutcheon and Citizens United decisions provide unprecedented ways for wealthy individuals and corporations to use their economic might to purchase political power. On the other, the Court’s 2013 decision in Shelby County v. Holder gutted a key provision of the Voting Rights Act28 and has cleared the way for a number of state legislatures to introduce and pass new laws that make it harder for all citizens to register and vote.  This dangerous combination threatens to shape a democracy of the money rather than the many. 
 
Take Back our Constitution from an Errant Supreme Court.  McCutcheon v. FEC is just the latest in a long line of cases in which the Supreme Court has misread the Constitution to strike basic protections against concentrated wealth’s dominance of public policy.  It is now clearer than ever that the Supreme Court’s entire approach to evaluating laws intended to curb the undue influence of big money is fatally flawed.29  The People must be able to enact protections that strive not just for clean governance, but also to serve the fundamental American values of political equality, accountable government, and fair representation for all regardless of wealth.  We can fix the Supreme Court’s errors through two paths.
Transforming the Supreme Court’s Approach to Money in Politics.  First, we can work through the courts, and transform their understanding of the relationship between political speech, money in politics, and the Constitution.  Over time we can harness widespread public disagreement with the Court’s current approach; develop and promote robust interpretive frameworks that go beyond corruption; promote these ideas with legal and popular audiences; and help ensure that newly appointed justices share the public’s common-sense understanding of the Constitution.  This can lead to an interpretation of the Constitution that empowers the People to safeguard our democracy.  This won’t be easy, but there are examples where the Court has accepted new principles and changed its approach, for example on racial segregation, marriage equality, and the Second Amendment.
Amending the Constitution.  The other way to clarify that the People have the power to rein in the influence of big money is to amend the Constitution.  A strong amendment would overturn Buckley v. Valeo, Citizens United, McCutcheon, and the rest of the Court’s misguided rulings.  Sixteen states and hundreds of localities have passed resolutions calling for an amendment.30
Shift the Balance of Power Towards Small Donors.  Though the Supreme Court has blocked us from enforcing common-sense limits on the use of big money in politics, we remain free to tackle the problem from the other side of the equation—providing incentives to bring more small donors into the system.  The best way to address the McCutcheon ruling immediately is to enact policies that shift the balance of power back towards average voters by providing additional incentives for non-wealthy citizens to make small contributions, and increasing the effect of these small contributions and hence the incentive for candidates to reach out to their constituents rather than spend time chasing $2,000 checks.  
The Government By the People Act (H.R. 20) and the Fair Elections Now Act (S.2023) are the best proposals in Congress.  The Government By the People Act, for example, would provide a six-to-one match on contributions up to $150 from a public fund; a $25 refundable tax credit for small donations; enhanced matching funds in the final 60 days of a general election for candidates in high-cost races; and create small-donor political action committees that aggregate the voices and power of ordinary citizens.31  Similar programs have been successfully employed in Arizona, Connecticut, Maine, New York City, and many other places.
Force Big Donors to Come Out of the Shadows.  First in Citizens United and now in McCutcheon, the Court has repeatedly relied upon effective disclosure of political spending to provide voters with the information they need to make informed choices.  Such holistic and effective disclosure requirements, however, currently do not exist.  Dark money groups such as 501(c)6 trade associations and 501(c)(4) political nonprofits spent hundreds of millions of dollars in the last election cycle without disclosing their donors.32  Ironically, Justice Roberts actually used this lack of disclosure of outside spending in part to justify more big money contributions to candidates and parties, writing that “[t]he existing aggregate limits may in fact encourage the movement of money away from entities subject to disclosure….  Individuals can, for example, contribute unlimited amounts to 501(c) organizations, which are not required to publicly disclose their donors.”33  Congress should force political 501(c) groups to disclose the large donors that fuel their election spending; the IRS should create clearer rules for how much political spending these groups can do; and the Securities and Exchange Commission should force publicly traded companies to disclose poltical spending (including contributions to dark money groups) to their shareholders.",research
"Judge Kavanaugh's record raises serious concerns that he would expand the power of big money in politics, weaken voter protections, and insulate the president from the rule of law.
Senators must press Kavanaugh and critically examine his track record on these issues.
 
In 2009, Judge Kavanaugh opined in a Minnesota Law Review article that presidents should be free from “time-consuming and distracting” lawsuits and investigations, and that the indictment and trial of a sitting president “ill serve[s] the public interest.”1 He also urged Congress to consider a law exempting the president—while in office—from criminal prosecution and investigation, including questioning by criminal prosecutors or defense counsel.2
These views suggest Kavanaugh would approve congressional efforts to insulate President Trump from the Mueller probe into his 2016 presidential campaign, and block efforts to hold him accountable. A Justice who believes checks on criminal behavior should not apply to the president raises serious rule-of-law concerns.
 
Judge Kavanaugh has authored six opinions about money in politics3 and joined another five.4 There is reason to believe that if confirmed, Kavanaugh would be more aggressive in lifting restrictions on big money than Justice Kennedy, who was no friend of reform, but at least strongly supportive of disclosure measures. Although Judge Kavanaugh has occasionally upheld campaign finance laws, he has often done so in such a way as to restrict their scope or invite further Supreme Court scrutiny.
Kavanaugh’s record reflects some of the most radical deregulatory impulses of the Supreme Court under Chief Justice Roberts. According to Kavanaugh:
 
He paved the way for super PACs, before the Supreme Court signaled in Citizens United that “independent” spending received near-absolute constitutional protection.
 
Judge Kavanaugh’s record raises concerns he would vote to strike down disclosure laws, putting him to the right of Justice Kennedy.
 
He has also signaled an openness to revisiting the “soft money” contribution restrictions.
 
He is willing to overreach to get the outcomes he wants.

Even when Judge Kavanaugh has occasionally upheld campaign finance laws, he read the law narrowly or invited the Supreme Court to reconsider it.
 
 
Unfortunately, ours is a long history of excluding people from the democratic process on the bases of race and ethnicity, which continues to play out today through restrictions on the right to vote that disproportionately hurt Black and Latino voters. Voting rights cases require sensitivity to this history, and to the disparate impact of voting laws on people of color. Here Judge Kavanaugh’s record also raises concerns.
 
In 2012, Judge Kavanaugh authored a three-judge court opinion approving South Carolina’s voter ID law under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act (the law which, before it was gutted by the Supreme Court, required certain state and local jurisdictions with a history of discriminatory voting practices to obtain approval from the federal government before enacting changes to voting laws).49 In the opinion, Kavanaugh rejected the Department of Justice’s claims that the law would have a discriminatory impact on voters of color.
 
In Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center v. HUD, 55 Kavanaugh joined an opinion dismissing a disparate-treatment claim, which challenged the manner in which grants were calculated for post-Hurricane Katrina property repair. Community housing groups alleged the relief calculation disadvantaged black homeowners by, among other things, tying the grant ceiling to the pre-Katrina home values and leaving black homeowners to shoulder a higher cost deficit.
Judge Kavanaugh should be questioned about carefully assessing cumulative burdens on the right to vote, as well as his views on accepting at face value state interests in preventing “voter fraud” without any evidence. He must also be pressed on analyzing discriminatory intent and disparate impact claims, and whether he believes federal civil rights statutes that outlaw practices that have an unjustified disparate impact based on race—including the Voting Rights Act, the Fair Housing Act, and Title VII concerning employment—are constitutional.",research
"How 27 States, Counties, and Municipalities Empower Small Donors and Curb the Power of Big Money in Politics
Decades of disastrous Supreme Court decisions have enabled wealthy individuals and corporations to have an outsized influence in our political system by allowing them to pour unlimited amounts of money into elections. Cities, counties, and states around the country have combatted this trend with innovative campaign finance reforms that provide public funding to qualified candidates.
Programs for public financing of elections provide limited public funds to help finance the campaigns of candidates who demonstrate popular support. These programs amplify the voices of local constituents while curbing the power of big money in elections. They accomplish this by reducing participating candidates’ reliance on large individual, corporate, and out-of jurisdiction donors, while providing incentives to reach out to constituents for small contributions.
Today there are 27 active programs in states, counties, and cities across the country that provide public funds to candidates for political office.1 The oldest programs have been in place for more than 4 decades, while new systems are being proposed. These programs vary in basic design, the scope of the offices they cover, and the amount of funding they provide to candidates.
Public campaign funding programs have been successful in diversifying the donor base of candidates in terms of class and race. In some places, these programs have also succeeded in diversifying the gender, racial, and class makeup of candidate pools. Program benefits include: 
Matching fund, voucher and tax credit/refund programs often (but need not) require participating candidates to accept restrictions on their fundraising or spending in order to qualify for public funds.",research
"With only the wealthy funding and communicating with the campaigns of elected officials, politicians are incentivized to make policy decisions that align with their donors’ interests, not those of their broader constituency. But the elite donor class holds views that don’t align with the general public’s, as a 2016 Demos study detailed. Demos cites another report showing that “policy outcomes generally reflect the preferences of the affluent, while ordinary Americans have very little influence.” Research into the U.S. Senate has shown that senators, once elected, “are more responsive to donors than they are to non-donors of their own party or to their own voters.” [...]
Other areas of the country have recently passed public financing measures. As of June 28, there were 27 states, counties and municipalities that offered some kind of public campaign financing, according to Demos. Overall, the results are similar to those in Seattle: greater race and class diversity among donors, more donors, more women running for office — and more of candidates’ time spent with constituents and less on fundraising.",media
"New York City’s system has enabled candidates ― especially those from less affluent neighborhoods ― to more consistently rely on small donors in their districts. “The city’s public financing system gives candidates an incentive to reach out to a broader and more diverse array of constituents to fund their campaigns,” a 2012 study by the Brennan Center and the progressive think tank Demos found.

"Public financing of elections, as a state and local democracy reform, can help enhance the political voice and power of working-class people and people of color.
Public financing of elections, as a state and local democracy reform, can help enhance the political voice and power of working-class people and people of color. It is an effective antidote to the outsized influence corporations and major donors currently have on both politics and policy. Today, an elite and tiny donor class—comprised of an extremely wealthy, 90 percent white, and overwhelmingly male subsection of the population – determines who runs for office, who wins elections, and what policies make it onto the agendas in Washington and state legislatures across the country.1
In places like Connecticut and New York City public financing has helped elect candidates who successfully championed increasing the minimum wage, paid sick leave, banning employers from checking credit scores, and repealing the death penalty.2
Public financing programs can, and should be designed to, achieve three key values: political equality, diverse and reflective representation, and increasing opportunity for exercising Independent Political Power3—all of which are critical for giving people an equal say in the policies and decisions that directly affect their lives.4
But not all public financing systems are created equal. Over the last few decades, three common types of public financing have been enacted, each with varying levels of success in fulfilling these core ideals and achieving specific indicators of a government by, of, and for the people. This brief provides a summary and assessment of the three most common types of public financing programs (block grants, small-donor matching and tax credits/refunds/vouchers) across a range of specific indicators tied to the values of political equality, reflective representation and exercising Independent Political Power: 
 
Grant-based programs—often referred to as “clean elections,” “fair elections” or “citizen-funded elections”—provide full funding for candidates to run their campaigns. Participating candidates receive a lump-sum grant from a public fund and no further fundraising is required (or allowed), so every participating candidate has equal resources with which to campaign. To qualify for the program, candidates must raise a threshold number of very small contributions (often $5) to demonstrate broad support in the community. To help participating candidates compete with big money opponents and unlimited outside spending, one jurisdiction has recently adjusted this model to allow candidates to receive a supplemental grant by securing a second round of qualifying contributions. Arizona, Connecticut, and Maine have statewide grant programs in effect.6
 
Grant-based programs generally ensure that campaigns are funded by the highest percentage of small dollars and public money and come closest to equalizing the voices of even the least well off (since all contributions to participating candidates are very small contributions); free candidates from spending the majority of their time fundraising (since fundraising is complete once the candidate qualifies for the grant, except for supplemental funding); and are best at equalizing the voices of candidates (versus voters) by giving them the same amount of money to conduct their campaigns—so campaigns can be contests of ideas promoted at roughly equal volume. 
The biggest downside is that grant programs can leave participating candidates vulnerable to wealthy opponents and outside spending attacks since participants are generally not permitted to raise or spend money beyond the limited public grant, and (due to a bad Supreme Court case7) cannot receive additional public funds to match opponent spending. In 2015, Maine updated its law with a strategy for addressing this problem by allowing candidates to qualify for supplemental funds by raising additional small-dollar contributions.8 Even with this adjustment, however, candidates must take a risk that public funding available (and the corresponding spending limit) will be adequate to keep up with an opponent. The system does not self-adjust by allowing candidates to keep raising small dollars to meet an unexpected surge of opposition spending.
It is difficult to draw firm across-the-board conclusions about the programs’ empirical impact on the key indicators listed above since there are only three statewide grant programs in effect in widely varying political circumstances (AZ, CT, ME). 
Grant-based system should, in theory, lead to policy outcomes more in line with public preferences and less skewed by the donor class. There is good anecdotal evidence that a grant-based system has led to better policy outcomes in Connecticut,9 with less clear evidence in Maine or Arizona. The programs have appeared to increase racial diversity in Connecticut10 and have encouraged more women to run in Maine.11 Evidence shows that qualifying contributors in Arizona have been more racially and economically diverse than those to opt-out candidates.12 Arizona experienced an initial increase in Latino and Native American candidates but as participation has dropped off (see below), so too have the program’s benefits.13
Participation rates have varied significantly. Participation in Connecticut’s system has remained robust—with 84% of winning legislative candidates participating in 2014.14 Participation has fallen off recently in Maine (53% of all general election candidates in 2014), leading to the 2015 initiative.15 Participation in Arizona has dropped off significantly since the program’s enactment in 1998, with only 25% of general election candidates participating in the most recent election cycle.16 This has been a result of both a 2011 Supreme Court case striking matching funds triggered by opponent or outside group spending and a significant increase in contribution limits in 2013.17 The varying degrees of participation are likely explained by a combination of the local political culture (Connecticut is much more progressive than Arizona, with Maine in between), the adequacy of public funding (and corresponding spending limits) in terms of making candidates feel they can participate and remain competitive, and the campaign finance that apply to opt-out candidates (higher contribution limits provide more of a temptation to opt out of the system).
The evidence on increased competition is mixed. Grant programs almost certainly increase the number of contested elections by lowering the barrier to entry for challengers. But, many races were uncontested either because the district is not competitive or there is a popular incumbent not particularly vulnerable to challenge (or both), so it is not always clear that more candidates translates into more highly competitive races. Nonetheless, additional candidates are reaching people not normally reached by privately financed candidates and could provide the building blocks for the creation of independent movements.
 
Matching fund programs match small contributions to qualifying candidates with public funds according to a specified ratio, which can be as high as six-to-one (in existing programs) or ten-to-one (in a proposed bill). This means that a $50 contribution from an individual donor can actually be worth $350 or more to a participating candidate. Under this system candidates continue to raise funds from small donors throughout their campaigns, constituents control the allocation of public funding with their own contributions, and candidates with more grassroots support will end up with more campaign funds than their rivals. To participate, candidates typically need to qualify by showing a threshold of support and then accept some restrictions (such as a spending limit and/or lower contribution limit); and there is usually a limit to the amount of public funds any candidate is eligible to receive. The goal is to amplify the voices of regular voters and thereby incentivize candidates to seek donations from a broad base of constituents rather than a few wealthy donors. 
Several states and local governments provide some type of matching program.18 New York City and Los Angeles are the leading municipal programs; Montgomery County, MD recently passed a robust program; and the Government By the People Act is the leading federal legislative proposal.19
 
Small-donor matching public financing programs focus on amplifying the voices (and dollars) of low- and middle-income voters compared with wealthy donors, versus focusing on candidate parity. In this way, ordinary citizens actually have more control over which candidates get more public funding compared with programs that give equal grants. The biggest weakness of matching programs is that to participate effectively voters still need disposable income—more than Americans in poverty have to spare. In addition, the success of matching programs can vary greatly depending upon the size of the match, the total amount of public funding available, and the various restrictions participating candidates must agree to abide by (such as spending limits). 
New York City and Los Angeles have robust municipal programs with high match ratios (6:1 and 4:1 respectively). While drawing across-the-board conclusions from this small sample is difficult, the lessons we can draw are directly applicable since these are two large, diverse, progressive cities.
Like grant programs, matching programs should lead to better policy outcomes by a) providing a viable path to office for those who lack access to wealthy donors; and b) motivating elected officials to spend more time with less wealthy constituents during (and between) campaigns. There is anecdotal evidence that the New York program, for example, has helped pass progressive policies such as paid sick leave. Yet in communities with low levels of wealth, candidates may need to go outside of the community for resources, potentially compromising the influence of their main voter constituencies and leading to less policy responsiveness.
New York’s program certainly appears to have diversified the donor base for city races.20 Both New York and Los Angeles have city councils that are even more diverse than their overall city population. The majority of the New York City Council is composed of people of color, and women also account for a high percentage of the Council’s membership. This suggests that small-donor matching programs are a good way to reduce entry barriers for candidates of color, and the level of funds at a 6:1 match is sufficient to provide them a decent shot of winning races. 
How well matching programs perform regarding the percentage of small contributions in elections depends highly on the match ratio and the surrounding limits. A program with a high match ratio that matches only small contributions and a low contribution limit can lead to a significant percentage of small donor money. On the other hand, a low match ratio that matches the first dollar of a much larger allowed contribution will be much weaker on this scale.
Small-donor matching programs also appear to have a somewhat better track record than grant programs of attracting and sustaining high participation rates among candidates. More than 90% of primary candidates participated in the New York City program over the last two election cycles.21 This is at least in part because a well-designed matching system with a generous limit on public funding can self-adjust to a large influx of outside spending or big money opt-out candidates—participating candidates simply continue to raise small, matched contributions. But, again, it is difficult to make clear comparisons given the small sample size and varying political conditions. The matching program in New York City appears to have boosted competition generally, and led to fewer uncontested primaries.22
 
Voucher programs provide a “coupon” to individuals to donate to a candidate (or sometimes a party or political committee) who can then redeem the voucher for campaign funds. Voucher programs can—but need not—require candidates to accept restrictions such as spending limits to qualify to receive vouchers. The first voucher program in the U.S. was passed through a ballot initiative in Seattle, Washington in November 2015 and will be operational in 2017. The Seattle system provides each voter registered in the City with four $25 vouchers to support her preferred candidates. Eligible contributors who are not registered voters will be able to apply for vouchers as well.
States and the federal government have experimented with various tax credit and contribution refund programs over the years.23 Tax credit programs generally allow those who file long-form tax returns to claim a full or partial credit for small political contributions made during the filing year to candidates and sometimes parties or PACs. The tax credit can be refundable (available to those without tax liability) or not. Minnesota has used a refund program where contributors can apply for a refund immediately and not wait until tax season.
 
Voucher programs ideally combine the benefits of the grants system (giving even the least wealthy constituents an active role that does not require disposable income) and matching programs (constituents control where the public funding is directed so candidates have the ongoing incentive to reach out to people they typically ignore in the current system). Vouchers should perform well on all the indicators highlighted above, but since the Seattle system is not yet operational we do not yet have any empirical evidence. Key questions include: how many people will choose to use their vouchers, and will people who don’t receive them automatically (because they are not registered voters) be able to access them at decent rates. In addition, making PACs eligible to receive vouchers should drive participation (because more actors will be soliciting voucher contributions and therefore making people aware of the program) and help build Independent Political Power—but Seattle’s program does not permit this so we will not be able to assess it in the near future.
The research on tax credit and refund programs suggests that full (as opposed to partial) tax credits that are refundable and may be solicited by the maximum number of political actors (candidates, parties, PACs) are more successful at promoting the goals outlined above.24 The Minnesota refund program performed better than tax credits on these measures, and came closer to eliminating income as the primary factor driving whether someone contributes to campaigns.25 All of this evidence suggests that vouchers will perform better than tax credits and refund programs with respect to all of the priority metrics outlined above.
 
As described in the sections above and the chart below, different public financing models have general strengths and weaknesses. But, it is critical to keep in mind that the programs’ effectiveness is also driven by several key factors that cut across models:
In addition to the campaign finance rules, there is another critical factor that governs how effectively a public finance system translates into the goals outlined in this memo: local political culture and infrastructure. Is the local culture progressive and participatory or anti-government? Does a city or state have a robust progressive infrastructure that is developed, aligned, and ready to take advantage of fair money in politics rules to help elect favorable candidates and hold public officials accountable? Strong infrastructure is much more likely to lead to success across indicators, including ultimately producing policy outcomes that are more responsive to working people and people of color.

"The Supreme Court got it supremely wrong when it held that corporations had the same rights as people to spend money in elections.
Campaign finance laws protect our democracy from corruption and preserve the integrity of our elections.  These rules governing the use of money in politics were in a sorry state before Citizens United v. FEC. Here are ten ways in which the Citizens United decision has made a bad situation much worse.
The Supreme Court thought non-candidate spending would be “independent” and therefore non-corrupting. This proposition not only beggars belief, it led to the rise of SuperPACs, which are allowed to raise and spend unlimited amounts because they don’t contribute directly to candidates and are purportedly independent. These Super PACs, more than 250 of which registered between their creation in 2010 and the end of 2011, have super-charged the influence of the biggest corporations and wealthiest individuals. The Supreme Court still recognizes that contributions to candidates can be corrupting, which is why direct contributions can be limited; if outside groups coordinate spending with a candidate it is treated like a direct contribution and can also be limited. Rules exist to prevent coordination between candidates and outside groups. But these rules have been reduced to such swiss cheese that they barely maintain the pretense of independence.  That is how we’ve ended up with candidate SuperPACs - founded by former campaign associates, funded by family and friends, explicitly supporting one candidate, who is allowed to fundraise for these groups himself. These candidate SuperPACs are making a mockery of contribution limits by running figure eights around and through the coordination rules; the idea that they are independent in any real sense is absurd. 
 
Justice Kennedy wrongly assumed that disclosure rules would reveal who was spending money to influence elections and enable voters “to make informed decisions and give proper weight to different speakers and messages.” While certain groups are required to reveal their financial backers, the Federal Election Commission’s rules fail to enforce many disclosure laws. Underlying donors to groups running political ads remain hidden through technicalities. Even when a particular group discloses its funders, the identity of the real source of the funds can be shielded. With more and more money flooding the system the need for real transparency that gets to the true source of funds has never been greater. Groups that didn’t disclose their donors report spending over $130 million in 2010, and spending through new and less accountable channels continues to rise. In the 2010 election, outside groups spent over $280 million to influence federal elections, according to the Campaign Finance Institute. This was more than double the nearly $120 million spent by outside groups on Congressional elections in 2008, and more than five times the almost $54 million spent by outside groups in 2006. Voters deserve information, and are in danger of being misled without it. For example, a campaign about a change to zoning policy favorable to Wal-Mart was run by a group calling itself “Littleton Neighbors Voting No”. There, state disclosure laws revealed that the group was funded by Wal-Mart, and not a group of concerned citizens as the name suggests. At the federal level we are not so lucky. Tax-exempt groups like 501(c)(4)s, with names like Freedom Loving Americans for Freedom, can accept unlimited money from any source without revealing the names of their donors. These groups can give that money to a PAC and, though the PAC has to disclose its donors, the source of the funds is recorded as the tax-exempt group with the inoffensive name, not the name of the real source of the money. “What’s the difference between that and money laundering?” asks leading campaign finance satirist Stephen Colbert. He reminds us that “Citizens United said that transparency would be the disinfectant, but (c)(4)’s are warm, wet, moist incubators. There is no disinfectant.” 
The Court turned its back on the reality recognized by political actors for a century: concentrated wealth has a distorting effect on democracy, therefore, winners in the economic marketplace should not be allowed to dominate the political marketplace. Before Citizens United, the Supreme Court recognized in Austin v Michigan Chamber of Commerce that the government had a compelling interest in protecting our democracy from “the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public’s support for the corporation’s political ideas.” The Court that decided Austin was rightly worried that corporate wealth can dominate the political process and “unfairly influence elections.” Citizens United disavowed this understanding. The public supports the prior consensus of the Court. Shortly after the Citizens United decision, 78% of poll respondents agreed that the amount that corporations are allowed to spend in order to influence campaigns should be limited, and 70% believed that corporations have too much control over elections already. It’s hard to escape the conclusion that Government of and by big money supporters can only be for big money supporters. 
Citizens United concluded, without evidence, that independent spending doesn’t corrupt, ignoring that ingratiation, loyalty, access, and influence are the coin of the realm in politics. Justice Kennedy blinked when he wrote that ""[t]he fact that speakers may have influence over or access to elected officials does not mean that these officials are corrupt. ... Ingratiation and access, in any event, are not corruption."" Citizens United overruled recent precedent, McConnell v. FEC, which had upheld the very same corporate spending restrictions. The McConnell Court had found that corruption of government is ""not confined to bribery of public officials, but extend[s] to the broader threat from politicians too compliant with the wishes of large contributors."" The possibility that legislators will ""decide issues not on the merits or the desires of their constituencies, but according to the wishes of those who have made large financial contributions valued by the officeholder"" is a more subtle form of corruption than straight quid pro quo transactions, but is ""equally dispiriting."" Indeed, Justice Kennedy’s own opinion in a prior case, Caperton v. Massey Coal, recognized that an elected official could be, and would certainly appear, indebted to the largest financial supporter of his election.   Massey Coal had a $50 million adverse judgment on appeal to the West Virginia Supreme Court, so the CEO invested $3 million dollars to impact the judicial election. Lo and behold, his Supreme Court candidate won, and voted to spare Massey the fine. In that case, Justice Kennedy recognized that the disproportionate independent spending to elect the judge made the judge appear biased. Just as litigants have the right to impartial justice, citizens should have a right to a representative who will fairly weigh the interests of all constituents, not merely moneyed supporters. Showing a serious tin ear to our times, the Court also decided that “[t]he appearance of influence or access, furthermore, will not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy.” Eighty-seven percent of Americans polled soon after Citizens United believed that members of Congress are influenced more by donors than by constituents’ views. [more polls] Voters say ""we don't have a representative government anymore"" and believe that ""the nexus of money and power, greased by special interest lobbyists and large campaign donations"" means that ""the game is rigged"" and ""the wealthy and big industries get policies that reinforce their advantage."" Citizens United’s constricted understanding of true corruption of a representative democracy has potentially disastrous consequences for the core principal of self-government on which our democracy rests.   
The Supreme Court required electoral districts to be drawn with roughly equal populations because the Constitution “demands” that each citizen have “an equally effective voice.” Hence, “one person, one vote.” When corporations, or other big money spenders, are able to flood the airwaves with their messages, they can effectively drown out the voices of other citizens, whose democratic right to political speech deserves no less protection than those with financial resources. This undermines the political equality that gives our government legitimacy.  A town hall meeting, or Congress for that matter, has rules so that each person who wants to is able to speak. Otherwise the discourse would be in danger of being overwhelmed by a “Heckler’s veto,” where one voice overwhelms other rightful participants. Montana recently upheld its restrictions on corporate political spending in part to defend the engagement of the electorate.  One Judge wrote that “it is utter nonsense to think that ordinary citizens or candidates can spend enough to place their experience, wisdom, and views before the voters and keep pace with the virtually unlimited spending capability of corporations to place corporate views before the electorate. In spending ability, bigger really is better; and with campaign advertising and attack ads, quantity counts. In the end, candidates and the public will become mere bystanders in elections.” In a prior case defending contribution limits Justice Breyer wrote that “by limiting the size of the largest contributions, such restrictions aim to democratize the influence that money itself may bring to bear upon the electoral process.”  With huge corporations and the richest 1% given free reign to dominate elections through unlimited spending, political equality suffers a huge setback. What’s ultimately at stake is how much say the average citizen has over the policies that govern her life.  The answer is clear: much less than before Citizens United.
The Citizens United decision renews the Court’s mistaken commitment to idea that money is speech. At the beginning of this century Justice Stevens wrote that “Money is property; it is not speech.” “Speech has the power to inspire volunteers to perform a multitude of tasks on a campaign trail, on a battleground, or even on a football field.  Money, meanwhile, has the power to pay hired laborers to perform the same tasks.  It does not follow, however, that the First Amendment provides the same measure of protection to the use of money to accomplish such goals as it provides to the use of ideas to achieve the same results.” Judge Nelson of the Montana Supreme Court wrote “Citizens United has turned the First Amendment’s ‘open marketplace’ of ideas into an auction house for . . . corporatists. Freedom of speech is now synonymous with freedom to spend. Speech equals money; money equals democracy. This decidedly was not the view of the constitutional founders, who favored the preeminence of individual interests over those of big business.” This perversion of the First Amendment must be overcome if we are to have sensible rules for money in politics. 
 
Now that reform opponents have succeeded in striking down the century old prohibition on corporate spending in elections, they are attacking any and all campaign finance rules left standing. Opponents of reasonable money in politics rules are fighting to allow corporations to contribute directly to candidates, and arguing against contribution limits. The Supreme Court upheld the ban on foreign money in elections against a recent challenge, but didn’t explain the logical incoherence with Citizens United–namely, that foreign money might make beneficiaries improperly in debt to foreign interests, but corporate money doesn’t pose the risk that beneficiaries will be improperly in debt to corporate interests. Worse, after years of bi-partisan agreement that transparency was a bedrock principal fundamental to open accountable politics, opponents are now attacking the idea that money in politics should be disclosed. Once again, Stephen Colbert sums it up, this time with a campaign finance knock-knock joke. As reported at TPM “Knock knock?” Colbert said.  “Who’s there?” asked the crowd. “Unlimited union and corporate campaign contributions,” Colbert said. “Unlimited union and corporate campaign contributions who?” the crowd replied . . . “That’s the thing, I don’t think I should have to tell you,” Colbert said. This would be hilarious if it weren’t so sad. Proponents of secret political spending cry “harassment” in an attempt to defeat disclosure laws that provide accountability over the corporate political spending allowed by Citizens United. But even Justice Scalia, no fan of many campaign finance laws, understands that “[r]equiring people to stand up in public for their political acts fosters civic courage, without which democracy is doomed.” 
 
The Court granted corporations extensive constitutional protections even before Citizens United. But in this decision the Court treated corporations as equally deserving of First Amendment rights as people, and found that the free speech rights of corporations were burdened by requirements that they engage in political spending through political action committees. Again, Justice Nelson of the Montana Supreme Court writes: “the notion that corporations are disadvantaged in the political realm is unbelievable. Indeed, it has astounded most Americans. The truth is that corporations wield enormous power in Congress and in state legislatures. It is hard to tell where government ends and corporate America begins: the transition is seamless and overlapping."" The Chamber of Commerce alone spent $32.9 million from its general coffers, and did not have to disclose the corporate source of the funds.  This was more than any other outside organization, and nearly double the amount the Chamber spent in 2008.  Citizens United allows corporations to flex their financial muscles and pressure officials to support their positions or risk massive spending attacking them in their next election.  In one example, a group called Farmers for Fairness created advertisements opposing the re-election of certain officials, screened them for targeted legislators, and explained that the ads would run unless the representative supported their position.  Though the ads had no connection to the group’s political goals to deregulate the hog industry, the Court would protect them as “political speech” rather than recognizing this transaction as a shakedown. According to Judge Nelson, the idea that corporations have constitutional rights like people is “an affront to the inviolable dignity of our species.” The events of the last few years can only serve to remind us what can happen when necessary protections are removed and leviathans are allowed to use their full economic power to gain and entrench greater political power.
 
The Court said that procedures of shareholder democracy would allow shareholders to know how their money was being spent and ensure accountability. But most publicly-held corporations don’t disclose their political spending even to their shareholders. Investor money is being used in politics without their knowing or agreeing to it. Now that corporations have the right to spend unlimited amounts of money on politics, they have a responsibility to disclose any money they spend to the owners of the company.  Getting involved in politics can present risks to the company’s brand, reputation, and shareholder value, as Target Corp. experienced in 2010.  Domination of politics and government by certain big spending corporate interests is not in the interest of the broader business community. If government contracts and regulations (some of which can serve as barriers to entry for start-ups and potential competitors) are awarded as a result of rent-seeking, that benefits only the current dominant economic players, not the economy as a whole. In fact, a recent poll found that two-thirds of small business owners say Citizens United is bad for small businesses, and 88% think money in politics plays a negative role overall. The Committee for Economic Development makes the point that without rules, corporations may find themselves shaken-down for financial support.  Responsible corporate actors may come to feel they are trapped in a prisoners’ dilemma - disadvantaged if they don’t play the political spending game, even if they would prefer not to.
 
The Supreme Court risks delegitimizing itself when it creates a legal fiction – that purportedly independent political spending cannot corrupt democratic government – and sets it loose on the citizenry. In Citizens United the Court struck down hard won political reforms enacted after much Congressional deliberation about the need for common sense rules to prevent money in politics from corrupting democracy. The five- member majority responsible for Citizens United overturned a section of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act that the Supreme Court had just upheld in 2003’s McConnell v. FEC. In his dissent from Citizens United Justice Stevens noted that “[t]he only relevant thing that has changed since [the Court’s controlling precedents were decided] is the composition of this Court.” Polls taken in the weeks after the decision showed widespread strong disagreement with the decision across party lines; a Washington Post-ABC News poll found that “eight in ten poll respondents opposed the decision, with 65% ‘strongly’ opposed.”  A recent Pew Research center poll shows that almost two-thirds of voters who’ve heard of Citizens United say it is having a negative effect on the 2012 presidential election; of those who’ve heard a lot about them 78% say the effects of the new campaign finance rules have been negative. By abruptly changing Constitutional decrees on issues central to our democratic government, ignoring political reality as determined by co-equal elected branches, and entrenching political power in undemocratic ways instead of opening it up to broader citizen participation, the Court runs the risk of reducing Americans’ respect for the highest court in the land. ",policy-briefs
"While no law prevents outside donors, for example, from investing in the campaign of a low-income person, the likelihood that they’ll do so is low. The problem is social capital: Low-income people lack it, and so their personal networks do not often contain millionaires with open pocketbooks. “A lot of times the need to fundraise large amounts of money prevents a lot of people who are qualified and who are leaders in that community from running for office because they don’t have networks that include wealthy donors,” said Allie Boldt, a Washington, D.C.-based counsel for the think tank Demos.

"In 2013, President Barack Obama ordered a review of election procedures after the 2012 presidential election was plagued with long lines. One of the “signal weaknesses” of the U.S. election system, a national commission found, was “the absence of a dependable, well-trained corps of poll workers.”
The primary causes of the problem, according to a 2014 report from New York-based think tank Demos, are a lack of uniform training before Election Day, disparate wages, and little recruitment among public employees and high school and college students.
The study found that only 30 states require that all poll workers receive training.

"Twelve percent of Americans change their residence every year.1 Between 2011 and 2012, 22 million voting-age Americans moved either within the same county or to a different county within their state.2,3 Yet, because voter registration is tied to your legal residence at the time of registration, if you move, you often cannot vote unless you re-register with the new address, even if you move just down the block. 
Back to full report
Tying voter registration to a set address adds an unnecessary level of red tape that prevents eligible voters from voting. Many people don’t know that you have to re-register to vote every time you move. A quarter of Americans mistakenly believe that when they change their address with the post office, their registration automatically changes as well.4
With Permanent Portable Registration, your registration moves with you when you move within a state. Any voter who has previously registered in the state will not lose their registration when they move. Allowing voters to stay registered when they move makes sense and is a natural evolution of a modern democracy. Permanent and Portable registration is not a new type of registration. It is just the administration of a previously valid registration. 
Implementing Permanent Portable Registration is simple. An election official accesses the statewide voter registration database, which states are required to maintain under the Help America Vote Act, to confirm that the voter is already registered in the state. Once the voter fills out an affidavit with his new address or new name, the voter votes a regular ballot. 
Allowing already registered voters who move to keep their registrations and vote on Election Day helps increase voter participation. Studies have shown that Americans’ mobility plays a substantial role in low voter turnout.5 According to the Census Bureau, barely one-half (51 percent) of voting-age citizens who moved in the last year reported voting in 2012. The voting rate jumped to 76 percent for voting age citizens who had lived in their residence for five or more years.6 One estimate concluded that if registration were portable within states, turnout would increase by as many as two million voters nationally.7
Not surprisingly, some groups move more than others. The added need to re-register with each move widens the voter participation gap among certain demographic groups. In particular:
Currently, Delaware,9 Hawaii,10 Oregon,11 and Texas12 allow voters who have moved within the state to update their registrations when they vote, and vote a regular ballot. Some states allow voters who have moved within a state to vote in their new county without having previously re-registered at their new address, but they can only vote a provisional ballot, which may require further action from the voter before it is counted. These states include Florida,13 Maryland,14 Ohio,15 and Utah,16 as well as Washington D.C.17
Florida has recently passed a law implementing Permanent Portable Registration in 2014, for any county that “uses an electronic database as a precinct register at the polling place.”18 Unfortunately, in the 2012 elections, Florida changed its laws to require voters who moved to vote a provisional rather than a regular ballot, and saw huge increases in provisional ballots compared with 2008.19
Automatic Voter Registration 
Automatic registration shifts the burden of voter registration from the individual to the state. States could automatically register eligible voters to vote at any opportunity where government agencies are in a position to verify a person’s residence and eligibility. Individuals could decline to register and protections would be built in to ensure only eligible citizens are registered. Data from the USPS, DMV, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and other agencies could be used to generate voter lists, and automatically update voter registrations of existing voters whenever they move. Austria, Germany, France, Belgium, and Canada already successfully use government-run databases to develop voter lists.20 Stateside, the Brennan Center for Justice has developed a proposal for automatic voter registration based on the Selective Service System.21
 In Oregon, Secretary of State Kate Brown made a push for automatic voter registration legislation in 2013,22 but the Oregon Senate rejected the bill on July 7.23 Under the bill, individuals would have been automatically registered to vote when a state agency received age, residence, and citizenship data and a digital copy of a signature from that individual, provided they were eligible to vote.24 The program would have begun with data collected from the DMV (including for non-driver identification cards), and would have eventually expanded to include data from other government agencies.25 All eligible individuals who had records in the DMV database would have been automatically registered in a process beginning January 1, 2014, and voter registration records would be updated when individuals updated or renewed their licenses.26 Voters would initially be registered as unaffiliated with any political party; later, they would receive a postcard allowing them to choose a party affiliation or opt out of voter registration entirely.27
In Florida, State Senator Jeff Clemens introduced a bill in January 2013 that would have automatically registered eligible adults using state DMV data.28 Sen. Clemens cited easing the burden on election supervisors and reducing potential voter fraud as reasons to support the bill.29 Hawaii and Texas also considered automatic voter registration legislation in the past year.30
In 2009, Minnesota passed an automatic voter registration bill, which was supported by the Minnesota Secretary of State but ultimately vetoed by Gov. Tim Pawlenty.31 The bill would have automatically transferred data from an application for a driver’s license, identification card, or learner’s permit to the Minnesota Secretary of State’s office; the Secretary of State would then register all individuals it deemed eligible to vote.32 After county registration officials received the registration information, they would mail a notification to newly registered voters informing them of their registration, and providing instructions for opting out if the voter was not eligible or wished not to be registered.33
Policy Recommendations
Voter registration should follow eligible voters when they move without requiring re-registration. Allowing this modernization increases voter turnout and can be easily implemented. In particular:
States should implement centralized statewide voter registration databases that would allow election officials to pull the registration records of any voter who moves. 
Election officials should have real-time access to these centralized registries at the polls to allow for an effective system of portable registration. 
States whose precincts are not already networked to the statewide voter registration database should develop a plan for connecting them. Election officials must be able to find registrations effectively and efficiently.
Ultimately, states should move to automatically register eligible voters to vote at any opportunity where government agencies are in a position to verify a person’s residence and eligibility. Individuals could decline to register and protections would be built in to ensure only eligible citizens are registered. (see Automatic Voter Registration for more information.)

"An Analytical Framework
Democracies across the globe are facing foundational questions about if and how democracy is in retreat. Global incidence of democratic instability and the rise of right-wing populism in the United States, Europe, South Asia, and elsewhere has led to a renewed concern about democratic backsliding, as scholars explore the factors that accompany or provoke the collapse of democratic regimes into authoritarianism. The United States is grappling with many of these questions as our current political moment reveals the underlying and in some times longstanding weaknesses in our own democratic infrastructure. From increasingly anxious concerns about Executive power, to persisting gridlock between parties and between Congress and the White House, to concerns about voter access and the modern media environment, this democratic dysfunction manifests in many different forms.

This debate among scholars, practitioners, and ordinary Americans has opened up a critical set of questions for the long-term future of American democracy. What are the dynamics that best explain the gap between the current state of American democracy and our aspirations for a just, responsive, inclusive, and legitimate democratic order? And what interventions might best help narrow this gap between reality and aspiration?
Drawing on contemporary scholarly and public debates, we suggest in this framing paper an infrastructural, systems-thinking approach to these questions. This approach draws upon the recognition that democratic polities require an interlocking and mutually dependent set of political, economic, and social infrastructures to give rise to a responsive, inclusive, and legitimate democracy. As these infrastructures erode, are broken, or become outdated, democracy’s viability falls. While this paper is not meant to offer a comprehensive literature review, this mapping of the key foundations of democracy can help frame and structure the debate over democracy’s challenges—and inform possible interventions.

"Rebuilding American Democracy in an Era of Crisis
On a frigid January evening in 2008, Barack Obama, then merely a junior senator from Illinois, shocked the political establishment by winning the Iowa Caucus. At the boisterous celebration rally, Obama delivered what would become one of the signature speeches of his political career, defining many of the central themes of his campaign and his presidency. “[T]he time has come,” Obama declared, “to tell the lobbyists who think their money and their influence speak louder than our voices that they don’t own this government – we do. And we are here to take it back!”1 If there was a central message in Obama’s 2008 campaign for the White House, it was this faith in a revival of American democracy – the belief “that in the face of impossible odds, people who love this country can change it.”2

Obama would go on to win the presidency, but within the next eight years, the aspirational hope of the early Obama era faded away, supplanted by something much darker. While the Obama administration achieved several significant policy changes, his term was also marked by the fallout from the Great Recession as well as increasingly vociferous opposition from conservatives in Congress. At its close, Donald Trump, a real estate mogul, shocked the country by winning the next presidential election, after rising to political prominence as the leader of the “birther” movement that questioned the very legitimacy of the nation’s first African American President.
In some ways, the Trump candidacy channeled a sharper frustration with the corrupt and rigged political and economic system than even that evoked by Obama in 2008. But Trump garnered his “populist” grassroots base by fusing this antiestablishment ire with virulent appeals to racism, misogyny, and xenophobia. As president, Trump has provoked widespread concerns about the threat he and his politics pose to democratic institutions.3 His public rhetoric has helped foster and encourage the resurgence of openly white supremacist and anti-feminist movements in American politics. The lack of transparency around his and his family’s business interests – as well as proliferating conflicts of interest and opportunities for self-dealing connected to them – raise concerns about kleptocracy and corruption. His attacks on the free press, independent judges, independent law enforcement, and his calls for criminalization of his political opponents all raise the specter of democratic decline in the United States.
Yet fears about rising exclusionary populism, lack of accountability, and erosion of existing democratic checks and balances all speak to deeper, more chronic problems of American democracy. Although Trump poses some unique threats to American democracy, in many ways Trump is as much symptom as he a cause of the weakness of American democratic structures. In a polity where trust in and responsiveness of political institutions is already low, where racial and gender disparities lurk just beneath the surface, and where many constituencies struggle to make themselves heard even in settings of “politics as usual,” conventional political structures – even those of the preTrump era – already fall short of democratic aspirations and ideals. The Trump era has exacerbated chronic failures into a more virulent and urgent form of democratic crisis. Thus, the democratic threats posed by the rise of farright populism raise a subsidiary danger: that efforts to reform American democracy will focus too narrowly on restoring an imagined pre-Trump era of civility and the accompanying “norms” of ordinary political behavior in a status quo ante.4 Even if such reform were possible, it would be unwise. Trumpism is reflective of the deeper and more chronic crisis of American democracy.
It is this deeper level of crisis that is the focus of this book. The threats to the ideal of democracy are widespread and arise from day-to-day failures of democratic governance: in how constituencies struggle to organize and exercise a share of political power; in the perpetual fracturing of communities along racial, gender, and class lines; and in how institutions of ordinary, daily governance – from cities to regulatory bodies – fail to operate inclusively and responsively. Rebuilding democracy – or rather building it anew so that it will include many for the first time – requires addressing these deeper structural challenges. Yet conventional democracy reform discourses themselves pose obstacles to this process. As we argue in this book, often ideas of “good governance” reforms and the allure of “civic technology” platforms capture attention and resources, but such efforts frequently fall short in addressing deeper problems of inequality, exclusion, and disparate political power. What we need is a clear-eyed sense of these chronic crises of democracy – and an approach to democracy reform that is sufficiently transformative and bold to tackle these crises. This book represents an attempt to map out what such an alternative, transformative approach to democracy reform – that places power and inequality at its center – might look like. As we will argue below, building a truly inclusive democracy will require deep investments in building bottomup, membership-driven civil society organizations, and radically more participatory and democratic policymaking institutions that these organizations can engage and influence.
But before we can explore these forward-looking directions, the rest of this chapter explores in more depth three key background arguments that serve as the foundation for this book: first, that the crisis of democracy is a structural and chronic one, based in deep patterns of inequality and exclusion that cut beyond the current debates over the Trump administration; second, that many conventional approaches to democracy reform fail to address these deep disparities in power and inequality; and third, that a democratic rebuilding agenda that does take these inequities seriously will have to look closely at both the building of grassroots civil society and social movement power on the one hand, and transformations to the day-to-day operation of policymaking institutions and processes on the other.

In the years since Trump’s electoral victory in 2016, there has been an explosion of scholarly concern for the dangers of “democratic backsliding,” much of which is devoted to unpacking the political, institutional, and sociological factors that tend to accompany or provoke the collapse of democratic regimes into authoritarianism.5 These accounts tend to share some common areas of focus, highlighting the threats posed by autocratic leaders, who by disposition are hostile to democratic institutions and civil liberties,6 warning that such autocrats can gain political power through conventional and legitimate means, particularly by building coalitions with existing parties and gatekeepers causing a gradual subversion of existing checks and balances and a consolidation of power.7 Some of these scholars warn that democratic backsliding can also arise in a less direct form, through increasingly polarized and scorched-earth forms of political conflict between rival parties for power.8
Given this fear of backsliding, much of this literature has tended to highlight the importance of defending existing institutional checks and balances, as well as restoring informal “norms” that govern political behavior – norms such as the “mutual toleration”9 of political opponents and “forbearance,”10 which require political actors, once in power, to hold themselves back from deploying the full range of their coercive powers to snuff out their rivals. In the American context, a variety of other norms have also been central to maintaining democracy, including norms against conflicts of interest for elected officials, and norms promoting internal deliberation (such as the expectation that the president will consult with legal and other internal experts before advancing policy proposals). It is these norms that prevent the executive branch from overreaching in normal circumstances.11 And it is these norms that have been most blatantly violated by the current administration, contributing to concerns about presidential overreach and arbitrariness.12
Yet a narrow focus on norms as the primary site for the threat of autocracy risks glossing over a much-needed investigation into deeper, more chronic problems of contemporary American democracy. The election of 2016 did not so much produce a democratic crisis as reveal one. The reality is that American democracy had already been deeply broken for years prior to that campaign cycle. The deeper, more troubling, crisis of American democracy stems first from the growing problem of economic inequality and its magnifying of disparities of political power, and second from systemic patterns of social exclusion that have limited political agency along racial and gendered lines.
 
One major long-term threat to democracy stems from economic inequality and the ways it can enable durable and often hidden forms of political inequality. Much of the scholarship on the democratic threat posed by concentrated wealth has explored the terrain of campaign finance reform and focused concerns on the ability of wealthy donors to influence elected officials to favor their interests.13 But economic inequality skews democratic politics beyond the campaign finance context. Indeed, this disparity in political influence extends even beyond the electoral arena to the day-to-day practice of politics and governance. Through a variety of mechanisms, wealthier constituencies and business interests are able to steer policymaking to favor their interests over others. In the process, they also undermine the ability of other constituencies to advocate for themselves on fair and equal terms. An extensive social science literature has in recent years documented more pervasive disparities in how public policy skews toward the preferences of wealthier and more elite constituencies.14 Democracy in practice is less about “the mass public” as it is about the contest between organized interests – but in practice some interests have been vastly more effective at exercising influence than others. Laypersons in the general public often have little information about, or low motivation to participate in, electoral politics.15 Political voice and influence have, by contrast, often been produced through organized political activity. It is through civic association that many individuals gain knowledge, experience, and political efficacy.16 Association not only increases the political efficacy of individuals and communities; associations themselves also can exercise direct influence on public policy through interest-group lobbying and politics. As a result, the changing balance between different civic associations has macro implications for the functioning of American democracy.
Recent political science scholarship has documented how business groups shifted their organizing strategies and advocacy goals in the 1970s and again in the 1990s.17 The result has been a concerted effort to build a well-resourced and sophisticated system for lobbying, advocacy, and exerting influence on state and federal policymakers. Organized business advocacy groups outweigh labor organizations, public interest groups, and marginalized constituencies in their lobbying presence.18 This influence is magnified by the close alignment between business interests and the Republican Party.19 Business interests have also vastly outweighed other actors through lobbying and influencing regulatory bodies.20
This increase in political power on the part of business has in turn led to the pursuit of policies that further concentrate economic wealth and therefore political influence – for example through the promotion of tax cuts, “right to work” laws that fragment the ability of labor unions to exercise oppositional political power, and other similar shifts.21 Indeed, business interests have focused on policy changes that – like the busting of unions – undermine the countervailing power of labor and other rival interest groups.22 Meanwhile, the countervailing power of workers and other constituencies has been further undermined by the gradual shift away from mass-member organizations to professionalized nonprofit advocacy groups.23 Scholars have documented the decline of organized labor and other mass-member civil society institutions in recent decades.24 While these professionalized advocates can be more sophisticated in their lobbying campaigns, this shift has weakened the popular foundations that historically drove the political power of membership-based groups, from consumer leagues to labor unions.25
This disparity in political influence is further exacerbated by a growing class divide in political leadership. Fewer and fewer political leaders come from working-class backgrounds, leading to demonstrable skewing of policy outcomes in favor of wealthier groups.26 Similarly, shared social and cultural ties between economic elites and regulators help explain subtle forms of “cultural capture,” where regulators defer to industry interests and take a softer hand than they might otherwise.27 As Nicholas Carnes puts it, the disparity of political influence is a product not just of who is doing the talking – with more (and more effective) advocacy coming from elite and business interests – but also of who is doing the listening: as the policy class becomes less representative themselves of the economic and social diversity of the country, these disparities in responsiveness become more pronounced.28
Additionally, a growing body of legal scholarship explores the ways in which concentrated wealth itself might represent a threat to the values and institutions of constitutional democracy.29 The existing institutional structure of checks and balances in democratic politics in the American system depends on a dynamic interaction between institutions on the one hand and the political powers and interests that occupy those institutions at any given point in time on the other; changes in the configuration of these interest groups affect how the institutions themselves operate.30 The Madisonian system of checks and balances requires self-interested political factions to leverage existing institutions to check rival factions – i.e., Congress checking the executive or states competing with one another. But when political interests and factions control multiple branches or operate to deliberately block some of these forms of accountability, the Madisonian system breaks down.31 Furthermore, when one party or some group of factions deploys these forms of political blockage and hardball asymmetrically over other factions, it threatens long-term damage to institutions of responsiveness.32 A similar dynamic manifests throughout our political system, as more wealthy interests are able to systematically skew policymaking to their favor, while other constituencies lack equivalent and countervailing political power.
 
These trends are compounded by deep, persisting problems of structural exclusion along lines of race and gender. The failure of American democracy is simply not a new phenomenon; it is built on a chronic legacy of antidemocratic exclusion. This form of democratic crisis lies not in the outsized political influence of some factions or constituencies, but in a more extreme and localized exclusion of some constituencies from political agency altogether. Historically, this has been a central feature of American democracy in the forms of legalized exclusion of enslaved persons, the legal system of Jim Crow, and the exclusion and subordination of women at common law. But even after the passage of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, Fifteenth, and Nineteenth Amendments, abolishing slavery, assuring equal protection, and nominally protecting voting rights, indeed even after the civil rights movement of the 1960s, there remain often-hidden systems of exclusion from equal political power and participation.
Consider the extensive critiques of the institutionalized and systemic domination that communities of color face under the criminal justice system. The problems of mass incarceration and over-policing represent a modern system of racial subordination akin to the Jim Crow era of racial terror and inequality.33 Over-policed and over-incarcerated communities of color do not, in a meaningful sense, live in a democratic polity marked by broad, equal, protected, mutually binding consultation. But similar patterns of structural exclusion appear in other contexts as well. Consider how precarious and insecure work is often racialized, leaving workers of color particularly vulnerable, or how the welfare bureaucracy treats mostly minority recipients and applicants, or how housing and zoning systems of many cities concentrate racial minorities and poverty in particular neighborhoods. These are all ways of constructing second-class citizenship for racial minorities, magnifying their economic and political inequality.34
This form of systemic racial exclusion is echoed in other contexts and with other constituencies as well. Legal and political assertions that certain spheres of life are apolitical “private realm[s]” have similarly operated at times to shield the workplace, the market, or the family from publicly political claims aimed at addressing disparities of power and opportunity therein.35 Similarly, legal regimes that immunize the inner workings of the firm from legal liability or political critique construct the workplace as a form of “private government” where workers are subject to the will of private managers and owners in ways that make them deeply unfree.36
These various issues, including racial and gender justice and labor law, involve “substantive” questions, that is, the substantive policy disputes that take place within ordinary democratic politics. Yet in the aggregate, these policies also construct implicit and explicit boundaries that limit who can make claims in public politics and what issues can be engaged in the first place.

Trump has been less constrained by norms, the nonlegal principles of appropriate behavior that presidents and other officials tacitly accept and that typically structure their actions.

"More than 1.2 million African Americans in 175 communities across the country have councils that do not descriptively represent them
The shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri brought to light a set of racial injustices in the lived daily experiences of the city’s African American residents.1 Attempts to understand this deeper context of the unrest in Ferguson have drawn attention to the near all-white composition of its elected officials. Though African Americans make up about two-thirds of Ferguson’s population, they hold just one of the six seats on its City Council.2
The gap between Ferguson’s residents and the officials elected to represent them is part of a larger pattern of African American underrepresentation in local government in the United States. More than 1.2 million African Americans in 175 communities across the country have councils that do not descriptively represent them. A council is descriptively representative if its members reflect the demographics of the community they’re supposed to represent. African Americans’ share of the council in these 175 communities does not reflect their share of the population.3
The effects of this underrepresentation don’t always explode onto the national stage, as they did in Ferguson, but that lower profile shouldn’t be mistaken for insignificance. African Americans who are not descriptively represented are less likely to be engaged in the political process or have representatives who forcefully advocate their interests.4 That combination of disengagement and inattention fuels the cycles of injustice and mistrust that built to the sustained outrage and protests in Ferguson.5
Ferguson has been pegged as an outlier but, though the representation gap in Ferguson is particularly pronounced, its basic story of African American underrepresentation plays out in many communities across the country. Of the 438 municipalities in which a descriptively representative council would have at least one African American member, 175 have councils that underrepresent their African American populations (see Figure 1). That leaves more than 1.2 million African Americans underrepresented by their local councils nationwide.

Underrepresentation at this level is an experience shared by comparatively few whites in the United States. Just over 500,000 whites live in communities in which their share of the population is not reflected in their share of seats on the local council.
And, though the gap between the absolute numbers of underrepresented whites and African Americans is striking, it doesn’t capture the full scope of the disparity. Whites outnumber African Americans 5-to-1 in the communities examined for this report so their smaller absolute numbers are also a smaller share of a larger total population. Just 1.5 percent of whites in the municipalities in the International City/County Management Association’s (ICMA) sample have local councils that don’t represent them. By contrast, 16.5 percent of African Americans in these municipalities are underrepresented. So, approximately one in every six African Americans lacks full representation on his or her local council, compared to just one in 66 whites (see Figure 2).

Particularly problematic is that many of the 1.2 million underrepresented African Americans live in communities in which they should have a powerful voice in local government. Almost a quarter of the municipalities with underrepresentative councils—home to close to half the total underrepresented African American population—have populations that are majority African American (see Figure 3). For residents of some of these communities, including the residents of Ferguson, the gap between their share of the population and their political representation is especially stark. Approximately 77,000 African Americans live in communities in which they make up more than half the population but hold only one or fewer seats on the local council.
The intensity of the response to Michael Brown’s death reflects the steady build-up of scores of daily injustices. Those injustices are rooted in a deep disconnect between the African American residents of Ferguson and their city’s government. Descriptive representation fosters engagement between residents and their representatives, forging connections that promote policies and practices that reflect the lived experience of residents and are viewed by the community as fair and sensible.
Descriptive representation can be especially valuable in cities like Ferguson, where there’s limited trust between residents and their representatives, but it also seems to promote engagement more broadly.6 Studies show that African Americans tend to be more engaged with the political process when they are descriptively represented. They pay closer attention to elections and vote at higher rates when they are represented by an African American official and are more likely to run for offices that are or have been held by an African American.7
In addition, African American officials tend to be more engaged with the African American communities they represent than their non-African American colleagues. Research suggests that African American legislators are more responsive to African American constituents than white lawmakers.8 They also advocate more forcefully for African American interests during the legislative process, proposing legislation and making speeches that promote African American interests at significantly higher rates than non-African American officials.9
The causes of African American underrepresentation are complex and often varied. One of the more robust explanations, explored in a burgeoning academic literature, traces underrepresentation to the way elections are run. Off-cycle election scheduling and nonpartisan ballots–both features of Ferguson’s City Council elections–have been linked to lower voter turnout.10 The electorate tends to get whiter as it shrinks and strong minority voter support is often critical to the success of African American candidates, so this combination of election rules can make it difficult for African American candidates to gain traction.11
There are also other obstacles to African American representation—as Ferguson itself illustrates. As the research predicts, voter turnout in Ferguson’s 2013 City Council election was smaller and whiter than its turnout in the 2012 presidential contest.12 However, even if the electorate had been larger and more diverse, it would not have produced a more representative council in that particular election. African American incumbent Dwayne James won reelection to his Ward 2 seat but there were no other African American candidates for Ferguson voters to cast a council ballot in 2013. In Ward 3, where much of the city’s African American population is concentrated, white incumbent Keith Kallstrom ran unopposed.13
One explanation for the shortage of African American candidates is the difficulty of being the first member of a demographic group to hold an office. As Paru Shah of the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee notes, “black candidates considering running for office may be wary of entering races in which they would be the first to break representational barriers.”14 This may be a factor in Ferguson’s 3rd Ward. Despite the size of its African American population, Ward 3 has never had an African American representative on the City Council.15
The nature of the job may also play a role. Councilmembers’ pay is often nominal—Ferguson pays its councilmembers a couple of hundred dollars per month—which limits the pool of potential councilmembers to residents with enough time and resources to serve on the council for little compensation.16
The factors that tend to make it more difficult for African American candidates to win elections and the factors that tend to discourage them from running can also interact. According to Shah’s research, one of the main factors African Americans consider when deciding whether to run for office is the strength of potential minority voter support.17 The historically low African American turnout in Ferguson’s off-cycle, nonpartisan council elections might have discouraged some otherwise viable African American candidates from running for a seat on the Council in 2013. In other words, though low voter turnout didn’t prevent African American candidates from winning a Ferguson City Council seat in 2013, it might have prevented some from running for one.
In order fully to understand—and be in a position to address—the persistent underrepresentation of African Americans in the United States, it’s important to take both sides of the representation equation into account. A complete analysis of African American underrepresentation includes assessments of whether and why African American candidates don’t run for office, whether and why they don’t win when they do run and how these two sides of the representation equation interact. In an upcoming report, we will show how obstacles to African American candidacy and electoral success have contributed to underrepresentation in councils across the country.
Data: The data for this report is based on the International City/County Management Association’s (ICMA) 2011 Municipal Form of Government Survey and was provided to Demos by Jessica Trounstine of the University of California, Merced. The ICMA survey was circulated to 8,813 municipalities, of which 3,566 responded. Demographic information was provided for 2,632 of these municipalities. The calculations in this report are based on these 2,632 municipalities.
The ICMA survey includes responses from a sample rather than the full catalogue of municipalities in the United States. As a result, the numbers in this report underestimate the total number of underrepresentative councils and underrepresented individuals in the country and should be viewed as minimums, or ‘floors,’ for underrepresentation. A full accounting of all municipalities would include many more underrepresentative councils and potentially millions more underrepresented individuals.
Descriptive representation: A council is descriptively representative if the demographic composition of its members reflects the demographic composition of the population it represents. In this report, we employ a conservative measure of descriptive representation. According to this measure, a council underrepresents a group if the group’s share of the council is equal to or less than its share of the population minus one councilmember’s share of the population. For example, a five-member council in a community that is 80 percent African American underrepresents African Americans if 60 percent or fewer of its members are African American. To be descriptively representative, this council would have to have four African American members.",research

"Demos is concerned about the extremely harmful impact that adding this completely untested question will have on the accuracy of the 2020 Census.
We are writing on behalf of Demos to urge the Commerce Department to reject the addition of a citizenship question to the questionnaire to be used in the 2020 decennial Census.
Demos is a public policy organization working for an America where we all have an equal say in our democracy and an equal chance in our economy. Our name means “the people.” It is the root word of democracy, and it reminds us that in America, the true source of our greatness is the diversity of our people. Our nation’s highest challenge is to create a democracy that truly empowers people of all backgrounds, so that we all have a say in setting the policies that shape opportunity and provide for our common future. 
Demos is concerned about the extremely harmful impact that adding this completely untested question will have on the accuracy of the 2020 Census. An accurate census count is critical not only to fair political representation, but to countless other functions of local, state and federal governments, as well as the data needs of businesses, academicians, and NGOs such as Demos.
The Paperwork Reduction Act (“PRA”) requires the Commerce Department to review public comments on the proposed change in order to
This comment focuses on the first and third criteria. Adding a question on citizenship status to the decennial census to which every household in the United States is required to respond is entirely unnecessary for the proper performance of the Census Bureau’s functions, and will greatly impair the quality, utility and clarity of the 2020 Census.
The proposed citizenship question for the decennial Census would ask of each household member: “Is this person a citizen of the United States?” Respondents would have to choose one of the following responses: 1) “Yes, born in the United States[;]” 2) “Yes, born in Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, or Northern Marianas[;]” 3) “Yes, born abroad of U.S. citizen parent or parents[;]” 4) “Yes, U.S. citizen by naturalization - Print year of naturalization[;]” and 5) “No, not a U.S. citizen [.]”
Even before Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced the decision to include a question on citizenship, experts strongly cautioned against adding such a question, both because it will inevitably decrease the census response rate, and because it was already too late to conduct any testing of the question, directly contrary to the Census Bureau’s long-established practice of extensive testing of the entire set of questions to be included in the census. 
For example, the American Statistical Association – the world’s largest community of statisticians—stated in a January 2018 letter to Secretary Ross:
As you know, the challenge of any census is maximizing the participation of all residents. In essence, it is critical to minimize the undercount, whether for geographic regions or for certain populations. . . . Maximizing census participation is particularly challenging in areas or among populations with distrust or suspicion of the government . . . . Adding a citizenship question at this late stage of the decennial census process would likely increase distrust or suspicion of the government among immigrants, many of whom are already anxious about government inquiries and activities.2
And regarding the issue of testing a potential citizenship question, the letter stated:
[A]dding a question at this late stage of the Census process does not allow time for adequate testing to incorporate new questions, particularly if the testing reveals substantial problems. Further, a new question undermines the validity of the extensive testing of the current questions carried out to date.3
Underscoring these concerns, the Census Bureau’s own researchers reported, in November 2017, that internal testing of the planned 2020 questionnaire even without a specific question on citizenship had revealed increased fear and non-response behaviors among respondents compared to previous years. The Bureau’s staff reported comments such as the following:
""The possibility that the Census could give my information to internal security and immigration could come and arrest me for not having documents terrifies me.” (Spanish interview)
“Particularly with our current political climate, the Latino community will not sign up because they will think that Census will pass their information on and people can come looking for them.” (Spanish interview)

Secretary Ross has himself acknowledged that Census Bureau professionals warned him that adding a question on citizenship “would negatively impact the response rate for noncitizens” and that “[a] significantly lower response rate by non-citizens could reduce the accuracy of the decennial census and increase costs for non-response follow up (""NRFU"") operations.""5 A recently disclosed internal Census Bureau memorandum includes even sharper warnings from Census Bureau staff, who stated that adding a question on citizenship would be “very costly, harm[] the quality of the census count, and would use substantially less accurate citizenship status data than are available from administrative sources.""6
A federal court recently summarized additional warnings from Census Bureau professionals against including a question on citizenship as follows:
[T]he last time that the census asked every respondent about citizenship was sixty-eight years ago, in 1950. Notably, since [1950],…the Census Bureau and former Bureau officials have opposed periodic efforts to reinstate a citizenship question on a universal basis. In 1980, for example, several plaintiffs . . . sued the Census Bureau, contending that the census was constitutionally required to count only citizens. Fed’n for Am. Immigration Reform, 486 F. Supp. at 565. In that litigation, the Census Bureau argued that reinstating a citizenship question for all respondents would “inevitably jeopardize the overall accuracy of the population count” because noncitizens would be reluctant to participate, for fear “of the information being used against them.” Id. at 568. Likewise, in Congressional testimony prior to the 1990 census, Census Bureau officials opposed reinstating a citizenship question for all respondents, opining that it could cause people to “misunderstand or mistrust the census and fail or refuse to respond.” Exclude Undocumented Residents from Census Counts Used for Apportionment: Hearing on H.R. 3639, H.R. 3814, and H.R. 4234 Before the Subcomm. on [13] Census & Population of the H. Comm. on Post Office & Civil Serv., 100th Cong. 50-51 (1988) (statement of John G. Keane, Director, Bureau of the Census); see also Census Equity Act: Hearings on H.R. 2661 Before the Subcomm. on Census & Population of the H. Comm. on Post Office & Civ. Serv., 101st Cong. 42-44 (1989) (statement of C. Louis Kincannon, Deputy Director, Bureau of the Census).7
The census will be used for the entire coming decade to determine states’ representation in the U.S. House of Representatives and the electoral college, and to guide the drawing of district lines at every level of government. It is also used to allocate approximately $800 billion in federal funding that is distributed based on state population. Adding a last-minute question to the census that will undoubtedly decrease the response rate in communities that are already difficult to count is therefore a direct assault on racial equity. It will directly deprive communities of color of political power and vital resources.
In addition, there is no cogent argument that the Census Bureau’s existing practices for assessing citizenship data are insufficient. The Secretary has claimed that he decided to add the citizenship question because the U.S. Department of Justice had advised him that it was necessary for enforcement of the Voting Rights Act. This explanation, however, has been exposed as pretextual, as Judge Furman noted in his opinion in State of New York v. U S. Department of Commerce:
While Secretary Ross initially (and repeatedly) suggested that the Department of Justice’s request triggered his consideration of the issue, it now appears that the sequence of events was exactly opposite. In his memorandum, Secretary Ross stated that he “set out to take a hard look” at adding the citizenship question “[f]ollowing receipt” of a request from the Department of Justice on December 12, 2017. (See Ross Mem. 1 (emphases added)). Yet in a June 21, 2018 supplement to the Administrative Record, Secretary Ross admitted that he “began considering” whether to add the citizenship question “[s]oon after” his appointment as Secretary in February 2017 — almost ten months before the “request” from DOJ — and that, “[a]s part of that deliberative process,” he and his staff asked the Department of Justice if it “would support, and if so would request, inclusion of a citizenship question.” (Docket No. 189-1 (emphasis added)). Along similar lines, in a May 2, 2017 e-mail to Secretary Ross, the director of the Commerce Department’s office of policy and strategic planning stated that “[w]e need to work with Justice to get them to request that citizenship be added back as a census question.” (Docket No. 212, at 3710 (emphasis added); see also id. at 3699 (e-mail from Secretary Ross, earlier the same day, stating that he was “mystified why nothing have [sic] been done in response to my months old request that we include the citizenship question”)). Slip Op. 65-66 (footnotes and citations omitted).8
Additional emails have revealed that, rather than initiating with the Department of Justice, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach contacted Secretary Ross regarding the addition of a citizenship question in July 2017, “at the urging of Steve Bannon.""9
In any event, there is no merit to the argument that adding a citizenship question to the census is necessary for enforcement of the Voting Rights Act. The Department of Justice has successfully enforced the Voting Rights Act throughout the 53 years since its enactment using existing census data on citizenship, and has never previously suggested that a citizenship question is necessary for such enforcement. Researchers, policy analysts, and advocates across the country, including those at Demos, have long found the data from the long-form census or the American Community Survey to be adequate for assessing citizenship information, and see no need for adding a citizenship question. To the contrary, enforcement of voting rights and other key civil rights laws will be dramatically undermined by adding a question to the census that is certain to drive down the response rates of communities that already feel under siege from the current Administration’s constant vilification and targeting of immigrants.
In sum, adding a question on citizenship to the 2020 Census questionnaire will greatly decrease the response rate, and thus the accuracy, of the Census, will add greatly to the cost of the Census, and is entirely unnecessary for any legitimate purpose. Demos strongly urges the Commerce Department to require the removal of this question from the data collection forms.

"Democrats have all kinds of ways of addressing this problem. One would be to cultivate the class identity of white voters by embracing populist rhetoric that paints “the billionaire class” as an out-group they can define themselves against. Another would be to invest more resources into registering nonwhite voters. According to the Census Bureau, 74 percent of non-Hispanic whites are registered to vote in the United States. For African-Americans, that figure is 69 percent; for Hispanics, 57; and for Asian-Americans, 56. As the policy analyst Sean McElwee has noted, this means that even if every registered Latino voter in America went to the polls last November, Latinos’ overall turnout rate still would have been lower than it was for whites (63 percent).",media

"In order to determine the best states in which to pursue a law-enforcement career, WalletHub compared the 50 states and the District of Columbia across 25 key indicators of police-friendliness. [...]
""The biggest issue facing police today is a crisis of public confidence. We have seen examples of racial discrimination, viral videos documenting misconduct, and widespread protest against incidents of police violence and the lack of accountability. Officers themselves report that it's a difficult time to be in law enforcement. And there are consequences for officers' ability to protect the rest of us. When people do not trust the police, they are less likely to report crime and cooperate as witnesses. This undermines public safety — often in the communities that need police service most.
The challenge is for the police profession to meet this crisis of confidence head on. It won't do to ignore the criticism, to mischaracterize it as a 'war on cops,' or to insist that police misconduct is just a matter of a few bad apples.
Police are public servants. They have the power to use force, even deadly force, in our names. In a democratic system that values liberty and free speech, that means people have the right and duty to scrutinize them.
Rhetoric about a so-called 'war on cops' is dangerous. It pits communities against law enforcement. It creates an us vs. them mentality that prevents people from seeing each other as fundamentally connected. It undermines public safety. And it corrodes our democracy by saying to millions of people who have found their voices, your government doesn't hear you.
The 'few bad apples' narrative is downright wrong — and also deeply unfair to cops. It attempts to blame individual officers for all that is problematic in policing today. In fact, the most pressing problems in policing stem from policy decision made far above the pay grade of a beat officer, often by elected officials who have never patrolled the streets.
Take stop-and-frisk in New York City. From 2002 to 2011, the number of pedestrian stops made by NYPD skyrocketed from 97,000 to 686,000. A federal judge found this program unconstitutional because people were being stopped unlawfully and in a racially discriminatory manner. Where should the blame lie for those violations of the Constitution? Line officers didn't spontaneously decide to increase the number of stops seven-fold themselves. That was a policy decision made by city leadership and the top brass of the NYPD.
Ferguson, Missouri, provides another example. The community in Ferguson came to resent the police because they operated as a ticketing and collections agency, and they operated that way because the city used them to generate revenue for its annual budget. The Finance Director was making policy around officer deployment and shift schedules in order to maximize revenue, with the police chief following his lead. Line officers were pressured to issue as many tickets as they could and to arrest people whose poverty caused them to miss payments on their outstanding court fines and fees. In Baltimore, officers complained that they were pressured to make their numbers -- keep their stops and arrests high -- by an administration eager to show it was doing something about crime. In both cases, the result was a pattern of constitutional violations. That's not a matter of bad apples. It's a systemic problem that must be addressed at the level of policy, training, and accountability to the community.
So how to build trust? First, police must respect the constitutional rights of all people. Violation of people's core rights -- their freedom to walk down the street, their right to bodily integrity, their right to be free from excessive force, their right to be treated equally regardless of who they are or what they look like -- is at the core of distrust.
Second, there can be no trust without accountability. Officers must be held accountable -- whether criminally, in the civil system, or by internal discipline, depending on the situation -- when they abuse their authority. When the members of the public see officers using excessive force or engaging in racial profiling without being held to account, they come to see the justice system as rigged. That weakens our institutions and tears at our social fabric.
Third, policing should reflect the needs and priorities of the community. Residents should be intimately involved in the design and operation of a police department. This means they should have meaningful input into policy, training, recruitment, and accountability systems. Police data and activity must be as transparent as possible.""
""I'm optimistic that the field can build trust with disaffected communities by being proactive. Already, we have a cadre of police chiefs and commanders who understand that systemic misconduct is real and must be addressed through long-term systems change. And communities are more organized than ever, vigilant about their rights and replete with ideas for reform.
At the same time, the rest of our institutions need to adapt. Right now, we ask police to do the job of social support systems that we have underfunded. We ask officers to respond to school discipline problems, family disputes, mental health crises, homelessness, and situations that stem from chronic poverty. They cannot do all of these jobs. No one can. We need to invest in education, dispute resolution, social services, and affordable and emergency housing. We as citizens must take responsibility for each other. We can't simply call the police and then blame them when things go wrong.
We've also got to talk honestly about the issue of guns in America. Many tragic police shootings occur because an officer fears for his life. Cases in which officers mistook a cell phone or wallet for a gun abound. Whether reasonable or unreasonable, that fear often results from the reality that guns are everywhere. Policing in a society awash with guns is incredibly challenging.""
""In many police departments, there has been an overinvestment in military-grade equipment. At the same time, there has been an underinvestment in the types of training and technology that could help ensure constitutional policing and avoid bad outcomes. For example, police departments should invest in incident tracking and data collection systems that can show how officers are deployed and whether they are enforcing the law in a neutral and impartial manner. They should invest much more training time in communications skills and de-escalation tactics.""

"All money in politics events should be planned in a way that elevates the most marginalized voices.
In an effort to broaden and diversify the movement to get big money out of politics, Free Speech For People and Demos are releasing this framework for organizing money in politics conversations that center voices that are marginalized by systems of oppression, including structural racism and white supremacy, heteronormativity, transphobia, misogyny, xenophobia, and ableism. These systems of oppression operate on a personal level, and on institutional and societal levels, to perpetuate and produce cumulative inequalities on the bases of race, sexual orientation, gender identity, immigration status, and whether or not one is able-bodied.
When we talk about centering marginalized communities, it’s important to keep in mind that such communities are not homogenous. For instance, queer, trans and gender variant communities in Boston likely have different needs and priorities than queer, trans and gender variant communities in Los Angeles. It’s also important to keep in mind that even within such communities, there are privileged and subordinated identities. For instance, white, cis folks carry privilege in queer communities; trans and gender variant people of color face compounded systems of oppression and inequalities. All money in politics events should elevate the most marginalized voices.
This framework includes three components: (1) a focus on personal narratives provided by grassroots activists, (2) education about why big money in politics and claims of corporate rights are harmful to our democracy, using class and race analyses, and (3) space to discuss forward-thinking solutions to empower the community to act. This framework is based on, and comes out of events on Queer and Trans Concerns around Democracy, and Money and Politics, hosted in Boston on April 22, 2017 and in Washington, DC on June 25, 2017 by Free Speech For People.1
This document provides an overview of questions and tips to consider when planning similar events, including goals, logistics, panelists, co-sponsors, and the afterlife of the project. is document also contains a schedule of a sample event and links to educational materials produced by Allie Boldt (Demos) regarding the current state of money in politics, and educational materials produced by Jasmine Gomez (Free Speech For People) that tie in issues of money in politics to the specific community being centered—in this case the queer and trans community.
Intersectional money in politics events are important because (1) they will strengthen the money in politics movement by bringing in more people—including people with unique perspectives who are valuable and often unheard in our political system, and (2) they can broaden the conversation on money in politics beyond a discussion of campaign contributions and how much money is spent on campaigns, to a conversation about the concentration of wealth and power in our country, and how this intersects with other systems of oppression.
Before moving forward, it’s important to note that whenever a group gets together to organize around a marginalized community, members of that community should be in the organizing group. For example, Jasmine Gomez and Allie Boldt—who are queer women with close relationships with trans and non-binary folks—organized the Boston event with Mason Dunn and Jason Lydon, trans and queer activists in the Boston community. The ideal planning committee would consist of organizers of multiple racial and ethnic backgrounds; trans and gender variant folks, including black trans women; people with various educational levels, economic backgrounds, abilities, immigration statuses, and belief systems; including folks at the intersection of these identities.
It’s also important to note that any money in politics event striving to center marginalized voices should also seek to create a democratic, non-hierarchical and racially equitable space for participants, including panelists and audience members. The event’s moderator can help facilitate this by encouraging “Step Up, Step Back” participation (step back from the conversation if you are talking too much, step up if you have not talked a lot) during interactive portions of the event, by asking folks to state their gender pronouns when they introduce themselves, and by collectively establishing any ground rules or processes to make the space more equitable. The event’s location and layout can also influence whether the space is welcoming, non- hierarchical, and racially equitable. If possible, hold the event at a location familiar to the audience you are trying to reach, and organize the room to be as open and non-hierarchical as possible. 
Goals help frame the event and logistics surrounding the event. Think: what does the team want out of the event, and who does the team want to reach? Are you looking to reach and educate a new, diverse audience? Do you want to show the money in politics community how this issue relates to a population beyond a predominantly white middle/upper-middle class? What do you want to come out of the event (e.g. connections with new organizations, educational materials, etc.)? 
If you have never organized an event within the particular community you’re trying to reach, a best practice is to provide a stipend to hire a grassroots organizer who can serve as a community consultant. The grassroots organizer can serve as a guide in navigating various community groups and organizers, community sentiments around those groups and organizers, and any interpersonal or political history between groups or organizers. The grassroots organizer can also consult on logistical details such as the event time, location, and community outreach.
Whenever deciding a question about coordination and organization, ask whether the decision aids the goal(s) of the event. Below are some questions to consider when deciding on specifics. 
Advertising: When advertising, again consider the crowd you are trying to reach. Millennials will often see Facebook events or other events hosted on online forums; families may find fliers in their neighborhood and schools; various nonprofits, membership organizations, and churches or other places of worship may bring out specific community members, etc. Fliers are particularly helpful for getting the local community to show up to the event (especially people who are not otherwise connected to any of the co-sponsoring organizations). Make sure the flier includes a summary of what the event will discuss, names of the panelists/co-sponsoring organizations, when/where, and you can also include a QR code generator to link the flier to a Facebook event or webpage.
Advertising through listservs is also important. This is an area where having a unique and diverse set of co-sponsors and speakers is particularly valuable; each co-sponsoring organization and each speaker can send information across listservs that will reach community members the original organization may have never reached before.
Photos, images, and language used to promote the event must be representative of the event’s speakers. When in doubt, consult with impacted people before using photos, images, or languages that you’re unsure of.
When working with grassroots activists, it is important to recognize that most of those activists work on an incredibly tight budget. Providing a stipend shows that the money in politics community values the time and perspective that grassroots activists provide to the movement, and it also allows activists to join who may otherwise not have the capacity to participate. Attempts to broaden and diversify the money in politics movement will not work effectively unless we pay grassroots organizers for their time and participation in money in politics conversations.
When working on the event, consider involving art that is related to the subject matter. Art makes events more engaging and can facilitate a deeper emotional connection to the issue, as well as a sense that participants are in a safe and non-hierarchical space. Art also makes events more unique and interesting, and can influence a person’s decision to attend an event or not. Art can either be directly related to the issues brought forward by the event (namely money in politics or democracy more broadly), or the art can be tangentially related. For example, the event in DC opened and closed with socially conscious rap performances by Jae e Lyoness, a queer black artist who discussed being Black in America. This acted as an important community-building exercise that provided an emotional tie to the material. Art can be visual, performative, sculptural, video-based, musical, dance-based, a group activity, or even a game.
Having the right panelists may be the most important part of hosting an event that centers marginalized communities. e people brought on the panel to speak can make this event different from most other events about money in politics. Instead of discussing only the theory and laws surrounding Citizens United, Buckley v. Valeo, issues around democracy, corporate rights, and money in politics generally, it is important to find panelists who can highlight the policy implications of these issues and tell personal stories connecting the money in politics movement to struggles that activists and others face when advocating for the targeted community. Tying in narratives of how money in politics impacts local community organizations makes the issue more personal, and allows people to connect in a way that theory and law alone do not.
When attempting to reach marginalized communities on a grassroots level, it is valuable and necessary to bring voices from within that community. e panel should likely consist of no more than two money in politics advocates and/or people working on democracy reform, and at least two grassroots organizers working on advocacy for the targeted community. It’s important to be mindful that not all activists receive compensation for their activism, which makes paying a stipend all the more crucial. e moderator should likely be a money in politics activist so they can quickly draw connections between what the grassroots activists say and the money in politics activists say. 
The sponsoring organizations do not have to agree with the other panelists about what the panelists are advocating for (the actual policy suggestions); instead, they need to agree that political spending is unjustly influencing the conversation around issues of concern to the community, and the range of policy solutions that are possible. To promote a truly intersectional conversation, grassroots panelists and co-sponsors must be given room to voice their preferred policy solutions, even if another sponsoring organization may not agree with (or cannot take a stand on) all of those policy solutions. Intersectionality and coalition-building require room to voice separate concerns in addition to highlighting areas of agreement. 
Finding the Right Panelists: To start, identify local concerns of the targeted community. For example, in Boston the queer and trans community cares deeply about (1) promoting trans rights on the state level, and (2) reducing high rates of incarceration for queer and trans people of color (and people of color generally). To understand the concerns of the queer and trans community in Boston, Jasmine attended local events hosted by prominent queer, trans and gender variant grassroots groups (not institutional players, but groups that were on the ground advocating for the rights of queer and trans people), and she listened to the community. While this was additional effort, reaching a new community is not an easy task. It is also worthwhile for the strength of the movement. The more intersectional the money in politics movement becomes, the more people will be fighting for political equality and demanding democracy.
After identifying local concerns of the targeted community, communicate with grassroots organizations working in that community about joining forces for an event. Do some research to find out how money in politics is affecting the concerns of that community, and present the organization with questions and ideas connecting their work with the problems of big money in politics and the concentration of wealth and political power more broadly. Even if the initial grassroots organizations reached out to cannot participate, they will likely be able to suggest other grassroots organizations that do similar work, and may provide additional insights on how big money and powerful corporations are affecting their work and advocacy efforts.
For example, when Jasmine approached the Massachusetts Trans Political Coalition (one of the grassroots organizations on the Boston panel), she discussed how the donor class is cis-majority and asked how this impacts advocating for trans rights. When Jasmine approached Black and Pink (the other grassroots organization on the Boston panel), she asked how the wealthy private prison industry and prison guard unions had affected pro-incarceration policies, and how that harms queer and trans communities in Massachusetts. Jasmine connected the concerns of money in politics to concerns these grassroots organizations highlighted at their own events. 
After finding the right panelists, and before the event, the moderator should try to set up a call with each of the panelists to go over the event and to get an understanding of what the panelist is going to say. This makes the event more predictable, and gives the moderator a chance to discuss the goals of the event and to think of follow-up questions and/ or how to highlight the impacts of money in politics through a specific story.
Co-Sponsors: Having a broad list of co-sponsors for the event can help promote visibility to communities that normally do not interact with issues around money in politics. Co-sponsors can go well beyond participants of the panel, including legal groups, institutional players, other grassroots groups, money in politics groups, etc. Institutional players often have the resources to pay grassroots organizers the necessary stipends. Outreach about the event may provide valuable opportunities to educate these players about intersectionality and how money in politics affects marginalized communities. 
When creating this event, think about goals for after the event finishes. Will there be any educational materials that come from this event? Will there be resources handed out to the community members? Should the event and information coming from the event be stored somewhere online (Facebook, website, etc.)? Are there new connections made that you want to continue fostering? Collect everything you can while at the event, in case you want to use this information later. If you survey people, collect their insights; take pictures and videos of the event; notice the questions asked during the Q&A session; etc. Collect any information that would aid in accomplishing any goals, including the names and contact information of the people in attendance. 
This is a sample schedule based on the “Queer and Trans Concerns on Democracy, Money and Politics” event in Boston. Within the sample are links to educational materials that can be used for various events. 
Moderator introduces self and own organization, and describes what the event is about. Moderator can take some time at this point to say that each panelist will discuss various policy issues and the impacts of money in politics on those issues, but that does not necessarily mean that the organizations all agree on how to solve the issues. They do agree that money in politics is stunting a conversation on how to solve the issues.
The introduction phase of the event should strive to establish a welcoming, equitable, and non-hierarchical environment. This can include asking folks to introduce themselves with their gender pronouns, encouraging “Step Up, Step Back” participation, and establishing any other necessary ground rules or processes. 
Moderator introduces and thanks co-sponsors, or allows them to introduce themselves and say a little about their organization. The moderator can also give room for co-sponsors to say something at the end of the event, or allow them to provide materials about their organization.
If people in the audience have a roadmap of the event and what to expect, they are more likely to feel comfortable. 
Starting the event with a quick poll will help the panelists understand the audience’s comfort with the subject area. It also can provide data for how much was taught during the event itself.
This is where the grassroots activists can provide personal narrative to highlight personal and policy implications of money in politics. After discussing some basics about money in politics, the moderator should provide context to switch panelists. Indicate that after learning about the theory and impacts via studies, this is the opportunity to see what that impact is on the ground.
Toward the end of the event it is important to ask the audience why this is happening. By this point, people are more likely to be emotionally invested in the material and already have a baseline understanding of the issues surrounding money in politics. Below are brief summaries of some of the main Supreme Court cases regarding money in politics and corporate rights. It is important to let the audience know that the only way to overturn a Supreme Court decision is through the Supreme Court changing its own mind, or through a constitutional amendment. is sets up the conversation to provide solutions right after discussing legal theories. ",research

"If we do not close voter turnout gaps, our democracy is destined to become less and less representative in the coming decades
Over the last half-century, affluent Americans have turned out to vote at significantly higher rates than lower-income Americans. On the surface, this would seem to pose a serious problem for equal representation in our political system, a fundamental tenet of democracy. Yet, the expert consensus on this issue, summed up in 1999 by Benjamin Highton and Richard Wolfinger, has been that income-related voting gaps are not consequential. Election outcomes and public policy, they assert, “would not change if everyone voted.”1 Elite thought leaders and the news media have largely assimilated this view, as reflected in former Office of Management and Budget director Peter Orszag’s assertion, in 2012, that “mandatory voting would have little effect on elections.”2
Many Americans seem to echo this view. Forty-one percent of non-voters say that they don’t bother to vote because “my vote doesn’t make a difference anyway.”3 The wealthy, who vote at exceptionally high rates, do not share this view. Recent survey work on political engagement, led by Benjamin Page, found that many of the wealthy they surveyed “acknowledged a focus on fairly narrow economic self-interest” when discussing their engagement in the political process.4 Unlike the 59 percent of non-voters who say that they don’t pay attention to politics because “nothing ever gets done; it’s a bunch of empty promises,”5 affluent Americans said they frequently discussed politics with friends and engaged with elected officials. The wealthy vote for outcome-oriented reasons; they have policy preferences they want to see realized.6
Other new evidence casts further significant doubt on the idea that class bias in our electorate isn’t important. Most important, non-voters tend to be much more liberal in their economic policy views compared to voters. Thus, turnout inequality is likely more consequential than previously thought, adding new urgency to election reforms aiming to close turnout gaps and foster a more representative electorate.
After studying 30 years of data at the state level, William Franko, Nathan Kelly and Christopher Witko could not find any year in which low-income voter turnout was higher than high-income voter turnout.7 Recent research by Benjamin Page, Larry Bartels, and Martin Gilens suggests that the super-rich members of the top 1 and .1 percent turned out to vote in 2008 at a whopping 99 percent. This compares to only 49 percent turnout for citizens earning less than $10,000.8 In midterm elections, the voting gap is even more pronounced. In 2010, only 26.7 percent of citizens earning less than $10,000 voted, while 61.6 percent of those making $150,000 voted.9 Voter turnout is heavily biased towards high-income voters (see Figure 1).

The old political science consensus holds that voters and non-voters hold similar policy preferences. Political scientists relied on American National Election Survey (ANES) data, which suggested that “voters are virtually a carbon copy of the citizen population.”10 However, that consensus is now being seriously challenged, with three important studies showing that there are significant political differences between voters and non-voters. 
In a 2007 paper that forms the basis for their book, Who Votes Now, Jan Leighley and Jonathan Nagler found that large gaps had opened up between voters and non-voters on opinions about the size of government and the proper extent of redistribution.11 As shown in Figure 2, voters are more likely to oppose unions, government-sponsored health insurance and federal assistance for schools.

These findings are supported by a Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC) study of Californians from 2006. The study found that non-voters are more likely to support higher taxes and more services. They are also more likely to oppose Proposition 13 (a constitutional amendment which limits property taxes) and to support affordable housing.12 A 2014 study by PPIC finds that the gap remains, with non-voters far more likely to support higher taxes and more services (see Figure 3).13

A 2012 Pew study that examined likely voters and non-voters finds a strong partisan difference. While likely voters in the 2012 presidential election split 47 percent in favor of Obama and 47 percent in favor of Romney, 59 percent of nonvoters supported Obama and only 24 percent supported Romney. The study also found divergence on key policy issues, including healthcare, progressive taxation and the role of government in society (see Figure 4).14 The splits are primarily along class lines. After reviewing evidence from the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP), Larry Bartels concluded that “No other rich country even came close to matching [the U.S.] level of class polarization in budget-cutting preferences.” 15

Studies show that voters are better represented than non-voters.16 Politicians don’t have strong incentives to respond to non-voters, who are disproportionately low-income. A growing body of research shows that, when turnout is more equal, politicians respond. In the wake of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, long-term Democratic incumbents shifted their voting behavior to respond to the newly mobilized southern black electorate17 Thomas Hansford and Brad Gomez studied more than 50 years of data and find that the “effect of variation in turnout on electoral outcomes appears quite meaningful.”18
On a more theoretical level, the Median Voter Theorem—which postulates that democratic systems will produce policy outcomes that align with the preferences of the median voter—also points to turnout gaps as a source of policy bias toward more affluent households. Because non-voters are more economically liberal than voters, the median voter is more conservative than the electorate at large. If more low-income people voted, politicians would become more economically liberal to court the new voters.
In an oft-quoted Supreme Court opinion, Louis Brandeis noted that the states often serve as laboratories of democracy.19 Turnout inequality, which varies from state to state, may be an overlooked part of this story.  The evidence suggests that higher levels of turnout equality would push policy in a more economically liberal direction—which is to say, a direction more in accord with the views of the full populace.
In Franko’s turnout levels study, he and his co-authors examined all fifty states over more than three decades and found that “where the poor exercise their voice more in the voting booth relative to higher income groups, inequality is lower.”20 In another study, Franko examined voting gaps and policy outcomes in three areas—minimum wages, anti-predatory lending laws and SCHIP (State Children’s Health Insurance Program).21 He finds that states with smaller voting gaps across incomes had policies more favorable to the poor. States with low turnout inequality have a higher minimum wage, stricter lending laws and more generous health benefits than those with high turnout inequality. Further evidence comes from James Avery and Mark Peffley, who find that, in states with higher rates of low-income voting, politicians were less inclined to pass restrictive eligibility rules for social benefits.22 Other research shows that states with a more pronounced turnout bias spend less on social welfare.23 Thus, the evidence confirms what median voter theory would predict: closing low-income voting gaps is consequential for public policy and would better reflect the views of all citizens, including lower-income households.
Fewer than 50 percent of people in the lowest income bracket vote,24 and it is increasingly clear that voting gaps of this magnitude are a significant factor in biasing public policy against a large majority of Americans, which includes large numbers of low-income households, and in favor of the comparatively tiny group consisting of the most affluent households. Thus, closing voting gaps is significant not only for strengthening the integrity of our electoral system but for achieving a democracy that improves the lives of all Americans, not just the affluent.  Fortunately, there are well-proven, commonsense policies that states can adopt to boost voter turnout and reduce the voting gaps between high- and low-income people.
Since the end of World War II, voter turnout has never risen above 65 percent of the electorate.41 Disproportionately, these non-voting citizens are low-income, young, less educated and people of color;42 at the same time, they are growing as a share of the eligible electorate. If we do not close the turnout gaps, our democracy is destined to become less and less representative in the coming decades. Already, a large literature shows that the opinions of lower-income citizens have almost no influence on policy.43 By closing the turnout gaps, we can help to arrest the growing misalignment of our political system and ensure that our democracy is working to represent the views of all Americans, not just the most affluent Americans.",research

"The Supreme Court’s ruling earlier this spring in McCutcheon v F.E.C., which increased the amount of money donors can contribute to political campaigns for federal office, has added new fuel to an 80-year-old debatebetween those who contend that the Supreme Court decides cases on the basis of abstract principles of law and those who argue that judicial rulings are based primarily on political and economic considerations.
Liberal critics of the Roberts court now draw a comparison between the court’s rulings in campaign finance cases like McCutcheon and Citizens United v F.E.C. (2010), both of which expand the ability of the rich to contribute to candidates, and decisions in two recent voting rights cases,Crawford v.

"Every day we are reminded how values of democracy and inclusion are threatened—from the weekly tumult in Washington to the ongoing threats facing communities of color and working families across the country.
But as we move into 2020, the reality is that these threats to democracy, racial equity, and economic inclusion are not just about the current administration. They stem from a deeper, more systemic failure of our institutions to empower communities in the face of a changing economy and persistent disparities of economic and political power. The movements we build and the policies we propose in these next few years will shape our country for the next generation.
This moment and how we meet it is at the heart of my new book Civic Power: Rebuilding American Democracy in an Era of Crisis, co-authored with Hollie Russon Gilman. In it, we examine what it would take to restore American democracy and revitalize civic power in an era of democratic inequality.
Civic Power argues that democracy reform at its core has to focus on building and shifting power—and that requires investing in durable grassroots power, on the one hand, and transforming our governance institutions to be more democratically accountable and responsive on the other. This also means that many traditional tools of democracy reform are in fact not powerful or transformative enough to meet the scale of the challenge we face.
Read an excerpt
Drawing on historical and social science research and case studies of contemporary democratic innovations across the country, Civic Power calls for a broader approach to democracy reform focused on meaningfully redistributing power to citizens. It advocates for both reviving grassroots civil society and novel approaches to governance, policymaking, civic technology, and institutional design. It has the aim of dismantling structural disparities to build a more inclusive, empowered, bottom-up democracy where communities and people have greater voice, power, and agency.
I am thrilled to be able to continue to explore these ideas at Demos. We are deeply committed to both building the independent grassroots power of communities of color and frontline communities, and to innovating bold transformative policy reforms that institutionalize greater democratic accountability and responsiveness. From our work with movement partners to our pioneering of policies that center racial equity and directly empower communities of color in everything from climate policy to economic governance, Demos has continued to be a leader on these issues.
I hope that this book provides insight into what drives our overall work and theory of change and adds an element of urgency to the need for that change.",blog
"There are also the racial disparities among retail employees to contend with.

"Another solution — though one that is often a struggle to achieve — is to unionize, which has worked before in industries like teaching, policing, and manufacturing. “If retail workers were able to organize strong unions across the country, there’s no reason retail jobs couldn’t be good jobs like manufacturing jobs,” Amy Traub, Associate Director for Policy and Research at public policy organization Demos, tells Bustle.
One of the many issues with unionizing is that companies are averse to change, especially when that change involves paying workers more money or providing them with more resources.  “[Many big box] companies are still built on the outdated, sexist model that their typical employee on the sales floor is a housewife who’s earning a little bit of money but the household budget doesn’t fundamentally rely on her contribution,” explains Traub. “She has a husband who’s the real breadwinner, so she doesn’t really need to be paid a family-supporting wage. Walmart popularized that model across the country, but now almost every big retailer pays that way because that’s what the market will bear. Yet that’s not who retail workers are.”",media

"The working class today is much more complex and diverse than the white, male, manufacturing archetype often evoked in popular narratives
Social scientists use 3 common methods to define class—by occupation, income, or education—and there is really no consensus about the “right” way to do it. Michael Zweig, a leading scholar in working-class studies, defines the working class as “people who, when they go to work or when they act as citizens, have comparatively little power or authority. They are the people who do their jobs under more or less close supervision, who have little control over the pace or the content of their work, who aren't the boss of anyone.""1
Using occupational data as the defining criteria, Zweig estimated that the working class makes up just over 60 percent of the labor force.2 The second way of defining class is by income, which has the benefit of being available in both political and economic data sets. Yet defining the working class by income raises complications because of the wide variation in the cost of living in the United States. An annual income of $45,000 results in a very different standard of living in New York City than it does in Omaha, Nebraska. Incomes are also volatile, subject to changes in employment status or the number of hours worked in the household, making it easy for the same household to move in and out of standard income bands in any given year.
The third way to define class is by educational attainment, which is the definition used in this paper. Education level has the benefit of being consistently collected in both economic and political data sets, but, more importantly, education level is strongly associated with job quality. The reality is that the economic outcomes of individuals who hold bachelor’s degrees and those who don’t have diverged considerably since the late 1970s. While people with bachelor’s degrees experienced real wage growth in the 30 years between 1980 and 2010, incomes among those with only a high school education or some college declined precipitously. Today having a college degree is essential (but no guarantee, of course) to securing a spot among the professional middle class. As unionized manufacturing jobs got sent overseas, the once-blurred lines between occupation and class grew quite sharp. The blue-collar middle class is an endangered species, shrunk to a size that makes it no longer identifiable in national surveys. The downside of using education to define the working class is that education is not a perfect proxy for establishing the power or autonomy one has in the workplace or society—the traditional definition of class. There are definitely well-educated workers who hold menial jobs or jobs that pay low wages, just as there are less well-educated workers who have jobs with great autonomy or power. It is a blunt definition, but in the aggregate it is a reasonably accurate way to distinguish between the working class and the middle class.
In this brief, “working class” is defined as individuals in the labor force who do not have bachelor’s degrees. This includes high school dropouts, high school graduates, people with some college, and associate’s-degree holders. It includes the unemployed, who are counted as still in the labor force as long as they are actively looking for work. Because it is increasingly difficult, and some would argue nearly impossible, to reach the middle class without a bachelor’s degree, the middle class is defined here as workers with a bachelor’s degree or higher. This both distinguishes the types of work performed by the working class and the middle class, and reflects a major distinction in how these different classes of workers earn their pay. Nearly 6 out of 10 workers in America are paid hourly wages, as opposed to annual salaries.3 And the majority (8 out of every 10) of these hourly workers do not hold a bachelor’s degree. As a result of the divergence in economic fates experienced by those with and without bachelor’s degrees, today’s middle class is overwhelmingly a professional class, comprising workers who get paid annual salaries, work in an office setting, and most assuredly do not have to ask permission to take a bathroom break.
 
Far too often, the term “working class” is conflated with white and male identities, frequently used as a short-hand to conjure the former archetype of the working class as a white man who works in manufacturing. Of course, the working class has always been more diverse than this stereotype, and that is even more true today (see Chart 1 and Chart 2). As factories shuttered and good jobs for those without college degrees became scarcer, millions more Americans earned bachelor’s and advanced degrees, a process that perversely exacerbated already hardened lines of privilege, with whites earning college degrees at a much greater rate than blacks or Latinos as the cost of college increased substantially over the same time period. As a result, today’s working class is more black and Latino than it was in the industrial era. And it is more female too, as a result of the growing labor force participation of women with children since the 1970s.
As the manufacturing footprint in the working class has shrunk, so has the white male archetype that has historically defined the working class. And as the share of private-sector workers in unions shrank along with those jobs, and working-class jobs became more diffuse and spread across numerous sectors, the idea of a coherent working class has lost its force.
Put simply, the working class shifted from “making stuff” to “serving and caring for people”—a change that carried significant sociological baggage. The long-standing “others” in our society—women and people of color—became a much larger share of the non-college-educated workforce. And their marginalized status in our society carried over into the working class, making it easier to overlook and devalue their work. The racial and gender diversity of today’s working class facilitates its invisibility in two important ways. First, a unifying, single archetype of the new working class remains elusive. Would it be a Latina hotel housekeeper? A black home care worker? A white warehouse worker? An Asian cashier? Definitions want to be neat and tidy, but this working class lacks the defining center of gravity that manufacturing provided the old working class. The second way in which the racial and gender diversity of the new working class undercuts its power is by the very fact that it is so disproportionately black, brown, and female—groups long marginalized in our nation’s political and economic spheres.
As the working class becomes more racially diverse with each passing year, addressing issues of economic insecurity will require addressing how gender and racial inequalities are woven together in the class struggle.
 
 
The largest sources of jobs for the new working class fall into 4 main groups: retail and food jobs, blue-collar jobs, cubicle jobs, and caring jobs (see Table 1). Many of these jobs exist at the bottom of a long line of contracts and subcontracts, or are staffed by temp agencies, or are part of a franchise system—all forms of hiring that no longer align with existing labor laws written almost a century ago, making this working class more vulnerable to wage theft, unstable schedules and occupational and safety hazards.
Food and Retail Jobs
Topping the list of the largest source of jobs for the new working class are food and retail positions, employing over 14 million workers. There’s an enduring image of retail and food workers as being high school or college students who cruise through during summers or work after school year-round but then kiss those jobs goodbye once they’ve earned better credentials. But like most stereotypes, this image is far from accurate. Among waiters and waitresses who are aged 25 to 64, a full 8 out of 10 do not have a college degree. Similarly, most retail salespeople don’t have college degrees either: 75 percent. But what about fast-food workers? Aren’t they mostly teenagers? Nothing epitomizes teen jobs more than flipping burgers or working the drive-through for any of the big fast-food companies. Well, it turns out that just 30 percent of fast-food workers are teenagers. Another 30 percent are aged 20 to 24. The rest—40 percent—are 25 or older.8 And just over one-quarter of fast-food workers are parents who must rely on meager pay and unstable schedules to provide for their children.9
The reality of retail workers is also quite different from the stereotype. Over half of retail workers are contributing 50 percent or more to their family’s income.10 And as in fast food, most of these jobs are held by adults without college degrees—defying the notion of a teen-centered workplace.
The Blue Collar Jobs
In the top-10 list of occupations providing the largest number of jobs in our country, 2 of the 10 (laborers/material movers and janitors) could be described as traditional blue-collar work, that is, physical labor done overwhelmingly by men. But unlike 4 decades ago, these jobs aren’t on the assembly line or factory floor. Today 2 million people in the new working class are employed as janitors or cleaners, earning an average hourly wage of $11.95.11 Nearly 7 out of 10 of these jobs are held by men. About half of them are held by whites, whereas Latinos make up 30 percent, African Americans 16 percent, and Asian Americans 3 percent of the other half.12 The other big occupation for working-class men today is what’s known as hand laborers and material movers, employing 3.5 million people.13 This is classic manual labor: moving freight or stock to and from cargo containers, warehouses, and docks. It also includes sanitation workers, who pick up commercial and residential garbage and recycling. The job requires a lot of strength, because most of the lifting and moving is done by hand, not by a machine.
The Cubicle Jobs
The third largest source of jobs for the working class, coming in at over 7.5 million, breaks into 3 large occupational categories: general office clerks, secretaries and administrative assistants, and customer-service representatives. None of these jobs requires more than a high school diploma, though a fair number of college graduates may find themselves doing this kind of work as a way to get their foot in the door. But by and large, these jobs are held by working-class women. They answer phones, file papers, deal with customer complaints, type memos, make copies, order supplies, and basically keep everything in the office running smoothly. These jobs are found in a wide range of settings, from doctors’ offices to technology companies to local bank branches. In fact, despite the prevalence of ATMs, over a half million people work as bank tellers, with a median pay of $11.99.14 And like fast-food and retail workers, one-third of bank tellers must rely on public assistance such as food stamps and health insurance programs.15
The Caring Jobs
Throughout the first half of the 20th century, it was not uncommon for white middle-class families to employ a woman of color to help clean the house, prepare meals, and care for children or elders. The legacy of this occupational segregation remains today: the majority of these caring jobs are still done by women of color, with a disproportionate share held by black women. Black women make up a full one-third of nursing assistants and home health aides and one-fifth of personal care aides (compared to about 6.5 percent of the population). Latinas make up 14 percent of nursing assistants and home health aides and close to 20 percent of personal care aides (compared to about 8.5 percent of the population). Taken together, close to 5 million people in our economy are employed as home health aides, personal aides, nursing assistants, and child-care workers, all earning around $9 or $10 an hour. The number of home-care industry jobs has more than tripled since the 1970s and will continue to be one of the largest sources of new jobs in the coming decades, as the baby boomers continue to age. Similarly, as the Millennial generation hits its peak child-bearing years, the demand for child-care workers is also expected to grow rapidly.
 
The median hourly wage of today’s working class is $15.75—a full $1.44 less than in 1980, after adjusting for inflation.16 Today more than one-third of full-time workers earn less than $15 an hour, and fully 47 percent of all workers earn less than $15 an hour.17 Close to half of workers making less than $15 per hour are over the age of 35.18 Looking at the working class as an undifferentiated whole hides very important distinctions by gender, race, and age (see Table 2). Like American society more generally, there’s a hierarchy of earnings. Working-class men still out-earn all other demographic groups in the working class, despite a nearly $5 per hour decline in real wages over the past 3 decades. Today the median hourly wage for working-class men is $17.56, down from $22.04 in 1980. The white working class makes significantly more than any other demographic group, thanks in large part to the higher wages of men. As Table 2 shows, hourly wages for most workers have been stagnant over the past 3 decades, with modest increases for women and only significant declines for men.
An examination of wage trends by race and gender shows the reality of an enduring white and male wage premium (See Chart 4). In 2015 white working-class men earned $4.11 more per hour than black working-class men and $4.17 more than Latino working-class men. White working-class women earned $1.94 more than black working-class women and $2.52 more than working-class Latinas. Across all races, working-class men earned more than working-class women.19
Women and people of color have made great strides in the past 50 years, but there’s no turning away from the reality that our society is still organized along relatively rigid gender and racial hierarchies. As the quality of the new jobs being created in America continues to deteriorate, the inequities by race and gender are further exacerbated.
Nearly twice as many women as men work in jobs paying wages below the poverty line. In fact, 5 of the most common occupations for women—home health aides, cashiers, maids and household cleaners, waitresses, and personal-care aides—fall into that category, compared to just 2 of the most common jobs for men.20 With the exception of waitresses, these jobs are either primarily or disproportionately done by women of color.
 
Much has been made of the polarization of American politics, with the conventional split being between Republicans and Democrats. What’s less acknowledged is how much one’s race correlates with being a Republican or a Democrat, a liberal or a conservative. Data from American National Election Studies (ANES), the premier source for public opinion on issues, elections, and political participation, shows substantial differences by race in whether someone considers themselves a Democrat, Republican, or independent—and less significant differences by class. Both blacks and Latinos consider themselves Democrats over Republicans by a very large degree. Working-class blacks are almost 3 times as likely as working-class whites to be Democrats, and working-class Latinos are twice as likely to be Democrats as working-class whites.
 
There is no doubt that the United States has a serious voter turnout problem. Over the past 4 decades, turnout in presidential elections has hovered around 60 percent. In 2016, 61 percent of eligible voters cast a ballot. And among that meager percentage, wealthier and white voters show up in greater numbers than others. In 2016, 48 percent of people with incomes below $30,000 voted, compared to 78 percent of people with incomes above $100,000. And contrary to popular perception, voters with incomes below $30,000 overwhelming cast their ballots for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump, by 53 percent to 40 percent.
Since 1972, the difference in the policy preferences of voters and nonvoters about government’s role in our society have widened, with voters much more aligned with conservative preferences and nonvoters more aligned with progressive policy preferences. Missing voters, who are more likely to be low-income, are more liberal on questions of redistribution in particular, specifically on the need for government to provide jobs, services, and health care.
Politicians focus their campaigns, and all of their polling, on motivating “likely voters” to cast their vote for them. But structural barriers, including burdensome registration procedures, combined with an enthusiasm gap means that the working class is more likely to be missing from the pool of “likely voters.” And so the agenda is set by an electorate that is more white and more affluent than the nation as a whole. This has profound consequences on the types of issues candidates campaign on and what they prioritize once in office. And those decisions have deep implications about the kind of social contract our elected leaders deem appropriate for our country, generation after generation.
Research on turnout and policy outcomes in other countries corroborates the idea that countries with less class bias in voting and higher turnout have more generous social welfare policies. Researchers examining our nation’s depressed levels of voting came to the conclusion that “low turnout offers a potentially compelling explanation why the American welfare state has been so much less responsive to rising market inequality than other welfare states.” A study of 85 democracies found that higher voter turnout leads to higher total revenues, higher government spending, and more generous welfare state spending.
One could conclude from this research that the recent conservative attacks on voting rights, from requiring photo identification to shortening early voting opportunities, both of which dampen turnout among younger, lower-income, and voters of color, are clearly designed to preserve an ideological hegemony that doesn’t reflect the needs of all the people in our democracy.
 
It’s all too common to hear a political pundit say that most Americans identify as middle class. But it isn’t true. Part of the problem is that many polls don’t even include the option of identifying as “working class,” instead offering only upper, middle, and lower class as options. It turns out that when polls offer “working class” as an option, just as many people self-identify as working class as middle class. The General Social Survey, a long-running public opinion survey, found in 2016 that 47 percent of respondents identified themselves as working class, compared to 41 percent who identified themselves as middle class. Interestingly, black and Latino individuals were much more likely than whites to identify as working class (See Chart 5).21 Seventy percent of Latinos consider themselves working class, compared to 54 percent of blacks and 41 percent of whites. In fact, in every year since the early 1970s, the percentage of Americans who identify as working class has ranged between 44 and 50 percent (See Chart 6).",research

Austerity dominates the current political debate even as the economy struggles to recover from the Great Recession. Bowing to political pressures, President Obama created a national fiscal commission in early 2010 to recommend ways to tame the national debt, and discussion about deficit reduction has dominated Washington since then. 
As a result of the debt ceiling showdown last summer, Congress enacted significant spending reductions in the Budget Control Act of 2011, despite predicted near-term job losses.1 The Budget Control Act set a cap on spending on discretionary programs from FY 2013- 2022 at $1.5 trillion less than current levels. The Act also required across-the-board cuts (sequestration) if the “supercommittee” on deficit reduction failed to come up with adequate measures. As no compromise was reached, without Congressional action, the sequester will begin to take effect in FY 2013. Regardless, $1.5 trillion in spending cuts over a decade will be required starting next year, even if the sequester is avoided, bringing discretionary spending to the lowest level relative to the economy since the Eisenhower administration. If automatic spending cuts occur, an additional estimated 2.1 million jobs will be lost.2
During this same period, proposals to address high unemployment and create jobs have seen far less traction in the national policy debate. There was no jobs commission created despite the high unemployment rate. President Obama’s American Jobs Act, introduced in September 2011, went nowhere in Congress and received only modest media attention. Even a bill specifically targeted at helping war veterans, a popular constituency, failed to garner enough support to overcome a filibuster last summer.3
In many ways, Congress has exacerbated the jobs crisis. Even as states struggled to recover from the recession, Congress failed to provide much-needed relief to the states to save critical jobs and services, citing concerns about federal spending and the national debt. The failure to provide adequate aid to state and local governments resulted in over 600,000 public servants being laid off since the beginning of 2011. If the public sector had grown, as it did during previous recessions, there would be 1.2 million more public sector jobs, 500,000 more private sector jobs and a lower overall unemployment rate.4
While a number of factors may explain this hierarchy of priorities in Washington, one point is clear: The focus on deficit reduction over jobs has reflected the concerns of affluent Americans and financial interests while downplaying an urgent desire by a majority of Americans to address job creation. 
 
Austerity advocates have successfully promoted the argument that without deficit reduction, our economy will suffer from inflation and high interest rates.5 In turn, they argue, inflation and high interest rates will dissuade investment and cause the economy to contract. Austerity advocates also argue that keeping interest rates low reduces the value of the dollar. Our exports then become cheaper, imports become more expensive and the increase in exports creates jobs.6
However, there is no evidence to support the fear that our deficit levels are threatening this kind of inflationary response. As long as output is depressed, the economy experiences little if any inflationary pressure. Interest rates are at historic lows and the Fed has indicated that it will keep rates low at least through mid-2013.7 Treasury bond rates are currently at 2.56 percent8 as investors across the globe seek out US government debt as a safe investment, belying the fear of bond market reprisals for federal deficits. Currently low interest rates have also done little to create export jobs. In fact, increased government spending is a more successful path to deficit reduction than deep spending cuts9 as targeted spending would put more Americans back to work, addressing the second largest reason for our current budget deficits: the economic downturn.10
Public investments, such as large-scale infrastructure projects, create jobs and increase economic activity. The increased economic activity would generate more revenue; a far more effective way to reduce the deficit than spending cuts that will cause the economy to contract. European countries offer a real-time example of how austerity can push recovering economies deeper into recession. Steep cuts to the public sector in several European countries have caused their economies to shrink, pushing them back into recession. The cuts also resulted in increased unemployment rates and perceived panic about debt caused interest rates on sovereign bonds to soar, making it difficult, if not impossible, to borrow money.11
 
By and large, the public prioritizes job creation over deficit reduction. Polling conducted after President Obama’s reelection found that 49 percent thought the election was a mandate for job creation while only 22 percent said that the President’s mandate was for deficit reduction.12 Exit polls after the 2012 election also show that job creation was a priority over deficit reduction. When given the choice between spending money to invest in infrastructure/public sector hiring, like teachers and firemen, versus cutting spending to reduce the deficit, 52 percent said that we should be spending money while only 43 percent said that we should cut spending for deficit reduction.13
The same poll found that 49 percent said job creation was the most important issue while 41 percent named deficit reduction as the most important issue. This gap is even larger for the rising electorate1 where 46 percent named job creation as the most important issue and only 33 percent identified the federal deficit. NBC’s exit poll showed that only 15 percent of voters thought the deficit was the biggest problem facing the country.14
Public preference for job creation is not a recent trend. Polls over the past two years have repeatedly found that while many Americans are worried about deficits and the national debt, addressing unemployment and improving the economy has consistently been a bigger priority for the public. For example, a June 2010 NBC News/Wall Street Journal Poll found that 33 percent of Americans named job creation and economic growth as their top priority; 15 percent named “deficit and government spending.” A FOX News/Opinion Dynamics Poll that same month found a similar spread, with 32 percent naming jobs as a top priority compared to only 12 percent that named the deficit. 
Most polls throughout 2011 and 2012 found that the public remained focused on jobs and the economy over the deficit by two-to-one margins or more.15 The chart below shows how Pew Research Center polls find that job creation remains a top priority over time.16

 
The “donor class”—the segment of the population that donates to political campaigns—is disproportionately comprised of affluent Americans. Of those that contribute more than $200 to a campaign (the point at which detailed disclosure is mandatory), 85 percent have annual household incomes of $100,000 or more.17 An annual income of $100,000 puts a household in the richest 20 percent of income earners.18
In contrast to the majority of Americans, the donor class does not prioritize policies to create jobs and economic growth. While little data is available on how affluent Americans view national priorities, a few surveys do explore this issue. For example, a September 2012 survey by the Economist magazine found that respondents making over $100,000 annually were twice as likely to name the budget deficit as the most important issue in deciding how they would vote than middle- or lower-income respondents.19
A 2011 Russell Sage Foundation study explored how wealthy respondents prioritized different policy choices. The survey found that 87 percent of affluent households believed budget deficits were a “very important” problem, the highest percentage of all listed perceived problems.20 The authors of the study comment further: 
One third (32%) of all the open-ended responses mentioned budget deficits or excessive government spending, far more than mentioned any other issue. At various points in our interviews, respondents spontaneously commented on “government over-spending.” Unmistakably, deficits are a major concern for most of our respondents. Nearly as many of our respondents (84% and 79%, respectively) called unemployment and education “very important” problems. However, each of these problems was mentioned as the most important by only 11%, making them a distant second to budget deficits among the concerns of wealthy Americans. 
Reducing the budget deficit is seen as so important to the affluent that a strong majority of them are willing to pay more taxes in order to reduce the federal deficit (65 percent) or cut domestic programs like Medicare, education, and highways (58 percent) for deficit reduction. In contrast, only 34 percent of the general public are willing to pay more taxes and only 27 percent favor spending cuts for deficit reduction.

 
Wall Street interests also heavily advocate for debt reduction. The “Fix the Debt” campaign has raised $60 million and recruited 80 corporate CEOs to lobby for a deficit reduction plan that would lower corporate taxes and place the cost burden of deficit reduction on lower income and elderly populations.21 Combined, the 95 companies that make up Fix the Debt have spent almost $1 billion on lobbying and campaign contributions over the past four years.22 In fact, 22 of the companies have spent more on lobbying than they have paid in taxes in the past three years.
If the Fix the Debt plan is adopted, 63 of the companies represented would gain as much as $134 billion in tax windfalls by being allowed to repatriate funds without paying taxes. To pay for this windfall, deep spending cuts would be made to safety net programs such as Medicare. On an individual level, the CEOs backing the plan received a combined total of $41 million in savings last year due to Bush-era tax cuts. 
 
One reason that the affluent may be less concerned about job creation is that they have generally been less affected by high unemployment rates and the economic downturn than other groups. Unemployment rates vary greatly based on educational attainment, which also corresponds to affluence. The unemployment rate for those with less than a high school diploma was 12.2 percent in November 2012.23 The unemployment rate in November 2012 for those with a bachelor’s degree or higher, however, is 3.8 percent – a rate which is considered virtually full employment by most economists. More generally, upper income Americans were less negatively affected by the Great Recession and have recovered more quickly. 
In addition to these factors, the affluent are significantly less inclined than other groups of Americans to support an active role for government in addressing mass unemployment. As the authors of the 2011 survey of wealthy Americans report:
Most striking, given the high importance that the wealthy attribute to the problem of unemployment, is their overwhelming rejection of federal government action to help with jobs. Only 19% of the wealthy say that the government in Washington ought to “see to it” that everyone who wants to work can find a job [presumably a private job]; 81% oppose this. A bare 8% say the federal government should provide jobs [presumably public jobs] for everyone able and willing to work who cannot find a job in private employment. Fully 91% disagree.

In contrast to this perspective of the affluent, majorities of the public generally support active government efforts to create jobs, including direct job creation. Several polls show majorities of Americans want the government to support efforts to increase employment. A 2011 NBC News/ Wall Street Journal poll found that 62 percent of Americans think the government should pay to retrain long-term unemployed workers.24
During the height of the recession in 2009, a Bloomberg poll found that 70 percent of Americans thought government should pay for worker training for the unemployed.25 The same poll found that a significant majority thought the government could directly create jobs: 66 percent favored job creation through spending money on public works, such as roads and bridges and 60 percent favored increased government spending on alternative energy. These findings were confirmed in a 2011 poll commissioned by the Ms. Foundation that found 62 percent of Americans think the government should focus on job creation, even if it increased the deficit in the short-term.26
The influence of money in our political system goes beyond the money spent on elections. Money also influences the policymaking process, as evidenced by how well the interests and priorities of the affluent class are represented in Congressional action—even when they run counter to the wishes of most Americans. Removing the outsized influence of the affluent in policymaking is necessary not only for the democratic process but to ensure that our economic recovery continues.",research
"Most states have very far to go in making their selective public institutions representative, and thus truly public.
By now, the images and stories are familiar.
In April 2018, just as they were setting off on a campus tour at Colorado State University, Thomas Kanewakeron Gray and Lloyd Skanahwati Gray (two young men of Mohawk descent; 19 and 17 years old, respectively) found themselves being questioned by police who were summoned when the parent of another prospective student felt “nervous” about their “presence.”1
In May 2018, Lolade Siyonbola, a black graduate student at Yale University, was accosted by a white student, who called campus police when she found Siyonbola asleep in the common room of her dorm.2 This was not the first time the white student, Sarah Braach, had called the cops on a fellow black student for simply being in the same dorm.3
Later, in July, Oumou Kanoute, a black student and teaching assistant at Smith College, was reading and eating lunch in a common room when she suddenly found herself answering questions from a police officer. The officer was called by a university employee who found Kanoute’s presence “suspicious” and “out of place.”4 The employee had not interacted with Kanoute or spoken with her.
Then, in September, police at UMass-Amherst received an anonymous call about a “black male” entering a campus administration building at 7:45 am.5 Police found and questioned the man, a university employee named Reginald Andrade who worked in the Disability Services office. This was a near-daily routine for Andrade, who would go to the gym in the Whitmore administration building before walking to his office. Andrade had worked at the school for 14 years.
These stories, and countless untold others, follow a familiar pattern. A student of color behaves as millions of other students have—finding a quiet campus space to eat, napping while studying, attending a party, queueing in line for a campus tour. Passers-by and, in some cases, law enforcement officers who carry with them the capacity for lethal force, subject this behavior to extra scrutiny.
These students and employees posed no threat to safety and were not causing any disturbance. In fact, most of them were sitting in solitude before being interrupted by law enforcement. But other students or employees view these students with suspicion precisely because these they do not see these students as a typical or ordinary part of their campus experience. They are not the image many people—including their peers—conjure when they think of the American college student. They are black or brown, Native American and immigrants, and their very existence in an elite academic setting makes others incredulous.
These incidents are easy to dismiss as one-off examples of a student or campus employee being too sensitive. Surely, the thinking goes, most other students would not call the cops on a student for simply being in a space. This is a comforting thought, but it is misguided, discredited by a country in which videos of African-Americans getting accosted and forcibly removed from public spaces have been produced at a breakneck pace.
Leafy college campuses have not been immune from the re-emergence of open white supremacist anger and racist hate crimes. In 2017 alone, the Southern Poverty Law Center found over 300 instances of racist flyers and other materials distributed on college campuses.6 And of course, one of the crown jewels of American public higher education, the University of Virginia, was the gathering ground for far-right white supremacists and neo-Nazis who descended onto campus in August 2017. One of the men who espoused neo-Nazi beliefs murdered 32-year-old Heather Heyer with his car.
Elite American higher education—comprising those colleges with selective admissions criteria, in which a large portion of students live on campus—is often considered a bubble. It is a bubble, but perhaps not in the way that many people think. It is a bubble because it is not open to or representative of the most diverse generation of students in our history. It has excluded people of color, and black people specifically, because elite higher education is reflective of an American society that has overpoliced communities of color, allowed racial wealth disparities to grow unabated, and ensured that the halls of power (in politics, business, education, and more) are occupied mainly by white people.
It is no surprise that students of color are socially excluded on campuses, or that the very existence of students of color invites awkward attention. Individual incidents on campus shine a light on this broad systemic exclusion of students of color. Despite a bipartisan recognition that education beyond high school is increasingly crucial, we have done little to ensure that an influential corner of our system of colleges and universities accommodates black and brown students, or even guarantees their safety.
This exclusion is true even for elite public institutions, which still have a basic responsibility to be representative of and responsive to the needs of their state populations and economies. It goes without saying that each state’s flagship campus and other selective institutions have a great deal of political power and cultural cachet. Thus, it is worth interrogating how they are doing at increasing the enrollment of black students, 50 years after the civil rights movement, at a time when higher education is more important than ever to achieving a stable life. We all benefit when these institutions are affordable, accessible, welcoming, and safe for all of their state’s students.
This brief takes a look at whether selective public colleges have made progress toward these basic goals. We find that, unfortunately, most states have very far to go in making their selective public institutions representative, and thus truly public. In many cases, institutions are less representative than they were a generation ago:
This report also discusses many of the dynamics driving social exclusion, from the black-white wealth gap and institutional funding disparities, to various social stigma and suspicion faced by black students on campus. Finally, it offers a framework of social solidarity and inclusion that can both repair harm done to African-American students and build a system that serves the interests of all students.
 
As college has become increasingly viewed as a necessary step in achieving a decent quality of life, the share of people going to college has risen steadily over the past several decades. Public colleges in particular enroll 5 million more students than they did in 1980, as Figure 1 shows.

As college access has grown, the share of students of color at public colleges has also grown. In 1980, white students made up 4 out of every 5 public college students. As Figure 2 illustrates, they now comprise a little more than 1 in 2. As the demography of America has changed, so too has public higher education.

Some of this is surely driven by an increase in the percentage of black students graduating from high school8 over a relatively short period of time. According to data from the U.S. Department of Education, the percentage of all students graduating from high school increased from 79 percent in 2010-11 to 84 percent in 2015-16.9 Black students experienced substantial gains: Their graduation rate increased from 67 percent to 76 percent over the same time. And in many states, black students increased their graduation rate by double-digit percentage points (see Figure 3).
 
And yet, we find that many selective public institutions—the colleges that receive the most public and private resources within a state, whose alumni often become titans of industry or politics—are not driving this diversity. As Table 1 shows, black students are continually underrepresented at nearly all public flagship colleges and other selective public colleges.
 
Nationally, black people make up about 1 in 6 of the total traditional college-age (18-24) population, and currently make up a similar proportion of this age group as they did two decades ago. In the 2015-16 school year, black students comprised nearly 1 in 6, or 16 percent, of high school graduates across the country. But they made up less than 5 percent of the students enrolled in large, selective public colleges.10 If we look only at each state’s public flagship institution, as seen on Map 1, white students made up 63 percent of all students enrolled in the fall of 2016, despite comprising only 52 percent of all high school graduates the previous spring.
 

The largest disparities are in the Deep South, perhaps unsurprising due to the legacies of slavery and Jim Crow. The numbers are worth laying bare, though. In Mississippi, black students comprise over half of all high school graduates but made up only 13 percent of undergraduates at the University of Mississippi in 2016—a difference of over 37 percent. White students, a minority (45 percent) among high school graduates, made up a full 77 percent of the total undergraduate fall enrollment.
In Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana,  South Carolina, and Tennessee, we see a similar story—public flagship institutions with robust academic legacies, whose Southeastern Conference football games are required viewing across the region (and much of the country) on Saturday afternoons, and where the difference in black high school graduates and overall enrollment approaches 20 to 30 percent.
However, this is not a problem relegated to the Deep South. Looking at other parts of the South and Mid-Atlantic, Maryland has a 23 percent difference in the percent of African-American high school graduates and enrollment at the University of Maryland – College Park. At the Universities of Virginia and North Carolina, the disparity is 17 percent and 19 percent respectively. At the University of Buffalo, the largest campus of the vaunted State University of New York system, the disparity is 11 percent.
Among states with Big Ten schools, the Universities of Illinois, Michigan, Ohio State, and Penn State University all have double-digit differences in the number of black high school graduates in their states and black fall enrollment. Ten percent of Wisconsin high school graduates are black. Yet the University of Wisconsin’s undergraduate student body is only 2 percent black, in total.
Even more troubling, we have seen very little movement in campus diversity over time across a number of large, selective public colleges, including flagship campuses and schools like Clemson, Georgia Tech, and UCLA. In 2016, 32 out of the 67 selective public colleges listed below enrolled a smaller percentage of black students than they did 20 years ago. Only SUNY at Albany saw a marked improvement in the share of African American students during this period: In 1996, 1 in 12 students at SUNY at Albany were black; by 2016, 1 in 7 students were black. (See Table 2.)
For some schools, this is an acute issue. In 2015, students at the University of Missouri began protesting a rise in bigotry on campus and inaction on the part of campus leadership in addressing it. Events in Missouri soon spawned a national conversation around free speech and race on campus, and led to the resignation of the president and chancellor. Since the episode, Missouri has struggled to enroll students across the board. But it is striking that while white freshman enrollment was down 21 percent in the ensuing fall, black freshman enrollment was down a full 42 percent.11
This long-term dynamic is occurring at time when selective public colleges have a greater pool of students from which they can choose. As mentioned previously, high school graduation rates for black students have risen dramatically across the country in a short period of time. And yet in many states, that has had little impact on enrollment at the flagship campus, as Table 3 shows.
Segregation in public higher education is nothing new. For instance, the rise of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) was a direct response to systematic discrimination and exclusion of students of color at other institutions. Most American college students do not attend selective colleges, and there are many other institutions, particularly within the public sector, that provide students with high-value credentials. In fact, many such colleges, from the California State Colleges, the City University of New York system, the University of Texas – El Paso, and others, are exceedingly successful at both enrolling working-class students and ensuring that those students are upwardly mobile.12
But the institutions with some of the most cultural and political power across their respective states fail to make meaningful headway in ensuring access to black students. This contributes to a two- or three-tiered public college system, in which the public research institutions that receive the greatest public support per-student are also enrolling a disproportionate number of white and wealthy students, while less selective 4-year colleges and community colleges do greater work with fewer resources at their disposal.
While per-student state support for all types of public institutions has declined over a number of decades,13 public flagship colleges do receive thousands of dollars more on a per-student basis from state and local policymakers. In 2015, public flagship colleges received nearly $14,000 per student in state and local appropriations. This compares to slightly over $9,000 for non-flagship 4-year colleges, $7,686 for public 2-year colleges, and a little more than $10,000 per student at public Historically Black Colleges and Universities. (See Table 4.)
In some states, as Table 5 shows, the difference in support for flagships and certain HBCUs is vast. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, for example, receives $16,000 more per student from state sources than North Carolina A&T University. The University of Georgia takes in over $10,000 more per-student than Savannah State University. And the University of Maryland – College Park gets over $8,700 more per-student than Bowie State University.
Table 5.
The state of Maryland, in fact, has been home to a decade-long legal battle between HBCUs and the state over the state’s disinvestment in HBCUs.14 The lawsuit alleges that while Bowie State, Morgan State University, Coppin State University, and the University of Maryland Eastern Shore have been underfunded relative to predominately-white institutions, other state colleges have been allowed to duplicate HBCUs’ most successful academic programs, thereby putting them at a competitive disadvantage. But even the remedies sought in this high-profile lawsuit are more likely to focus on how academic programs are created and grouped between institutions, than on the funding disparities themselves.
 
The case here is by no means that elite public colleges are receiving more support than they need. As Table 6 indicates, budget cuts over several decades, and especially amidst the Great Recession, hit public flagships hard, often resulting in rising tuition, a change in academic offerings, or deferred maintenance.
Table 6.
And yet, the public institutions where most students, including most black students, are more likely to enroll have fewer resources to do their jobs. With greater resources, these institutions could invest in academic and student supports, lowering the price and increasing aid for those who struggle to afford college, or on retaining high-quality faculty or expanding academic programs.
A well-funded and inclusive system of public higher education that improves attainment and keeps prices low for students requires putting far more resources into the system overall. And it must ensure that much of those resources go to the colleges enrolling the students who most stand to benefit, particularly if selective institutions continue to enroll very few black and brown students.
An inclusive system of public higher education would require state and institutional leaders to reckon with a yawning black-white wealth gap that gets larger at every education level, as Figure 4 illustrates. As the result of systemic discrimination, wealth-stripping, and public policies that create and exploit social exclusion,1516 the typical college-educated black household has less wealth than the typical white household with only a high school education.

The black-white wealth gap, of course, means that white families have more resources to pay for college or contend with eventual student loan debt. It also impacts social capital, or the social resources and opportunities that stem from relationships and economic status. These can take the form of business or academic connections that money can help lubricate—the type that can allow students to take on and benefit from unpaid internships or other resume-building opportunities. The disparity in social capital can prevent lower-income students and families from interacting with those familiar with how to navigate elite institutions.
As state support remains unreliable, prices go up and need-based aid becomes scarcer. This means that for those who dare to dream of attending a selective school, the prospect of extremely high student debt awaits them. Pennsylvania, which has seen some of the most draconian per-student cuts of any state, is also one of the most expensive for working-class students. At the University of Pittsburgh and Penn State University, low-income students must pay $20,000 annually, after any grant or scholarship aid, to attend school. (See Table 7 for annual costs.)
Table 7.
Source: U.S. Department of Education, Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System. Low-income students defined as those from families making $0 - $30,000 who received federal financial aid. 
Other colleges, like the University of Michigan, may offer a better deal for working-class families. But black working-class families might see this as cold comfort, considering Michigan has cut black enrollment rates in half over the past 20 years.
Colleges have also wrestled with lower state funding by enrolling wealthier students, out-of-state students and international students who pay more.17 This leaves fewer spots for high-achievers from low-income backgrounds and exacerbates a self-perpetuating cycle in which students with less wealth, more need, and fewer connections do not know anyone from their peer group attending these institutions.
While states can take significant action on their own to establish education equity, a comprehensive push likely requires the federal government must step in and reverse these trends—offering a way to increase per-student support, lower skyrocketing prices and debt, and provide the proper incentives and guidance to encourage colleges and states to expand opportunities for working-class students and students of color.
The federal government also has a role to play in keeping predatory actors at bay. In the 1990s and 2000s, a group of institutions offered to massively and rapidly expand enrollment of working-class students, veterans, and students of color. These institutions were disproportionately found in the for-profit sector. Readily available federal loan dollars, along with interest from private equity firms and the growth of online education, led to booming enrollment in for-profit certificate, associate, bachelor’s, and post-baccalaureate degree programs. Capitalizing on the importance of college to securing a good job, and the fact that black and brown people lacked access to good jobs across the country, many of these schools aggressively recruited and enrolled students of color, promising valuable credentials that would unlock the key to their dreams.18
Some of these institutions, despite receiving upwards of 90 percent of their revenue from federal loan, Pell Grant, and GI Bill dollars, left students with unpayable debts and degrees that were virtually useless in the labor market. When the Obama administration attempted to create new rules that would cut off federal funding for career programs whose graduates’ debt-to-earnings ratios were too high, they were met with steep resistance from for-profit colleges as well as Congressional Republicans.19 The Trump administration, in its first two years, has fought to keep these rules from being implemented.
So, over a several-decade period, black students have been met with declining black enrollment at elite public colleges, fewer resources at other public institutions including HBCUs, and increased risk from predatory actors filling the rest of the education system.
 
 In the face of overwhelming evidence that black students and other students of color pose no threat to the opportunity of white families to send their kids to a well-resourced college, a seminal project of the conservative movement has been to hamper colleges from using race as an admissions factor. These efforts have been successful: According to one study, 35 percent of selective colleges reported considering race in the admissions process in 2014, down from 60 percent in 1994.20 Only 18 percent of “competitive” colleges—a tier that denotes selective but not elite schools—used affirmative action in 2014, down from 46 percent 20 years prior.
A high-profile case, Fisher v. Texas, centered around one white student who sued the University of Texas at Austin when she was not admitted in 2008. Fisher’s grades and test scores were too low to finish in the top 10 percent of her high school class, which would have guaranteed her admission—and was the criteria by which the vast majority of students received admission. Yet her case plowed ahead, focused on the school having admitted 47 students with lower grades and test scores than hers, through a mix of criteria that included service and extracurricular activities, as well as race.
Of those 47 students, 42 were white. Simultaneously, 168 black and Latino students with higher grades were denied admission in the same year. Eventually, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the University of Texas’ admissions policies passed constitutional muster. Fisher later graduated from Louisiana State University.
This may be considered an example of a judicial victory for racial justice, but it also reveals a strong presumption of white qualification—and black disqualification—that activists must continually combat. Attacks on affirmative action are often couched in language around fairness or qualifications, an assumption that all applicants are basically on a level playing field. Opponents do not show the same zeal around colleges enrolling wealthy out-of-state students with middling grades or showing some preference to children of alumni or donors. Opponents are also undeterred by the fact that enrollment of black students has declined at selective colleges across the country. Their belief that this is not a phantom problem is rooted in assumptions about who belongs, and who is basically qualified to succeed.
 
Worse, these attacks also create a deep social stigma: that black students are taking the seats belonging to white students, that they are only present due to some misguided government policy. White students do not face the same scrutiny. Out-of-state students are not typically showered with suspicion despite the very real evidence that many are admitted because they can pay higher tuition.21 University administrators readily admit this: UCLA Chancellor Gene Block noted to the Washington Post that out-of-state students “pay full freight” and “bring in huge amounts of additional revenue.”22  Similarly, legacy admissions are not relentlessly attacked in the courts, despite the fact that colleges have a financial interest in enrolling the children of alumni, who will stay connected and ideally donate to the institution.
This unwarranted suspicion that only black students seem to receive is one dynamic of social exclusion. It is reflective of broader experiences facing black communities in the workplace, in wealth-building, in interactions with law enforcement and the justice system. We cannot possibly account for all the ways these dynamics play out on campus, but a few stand out.
 
The first is how white students leverage campus (or community) police in service of their own fear. The examples at the beginning of this brief are a snapshot of this. White students’ use of campus police and law enforcement to keep tabs on black students who pose no threat creates a dangerous situation for black students. It amounts to a waste of campus or public resources and attention that could be spent solving actual problems. But more importantly, it enforces exclusive expectations of who belongs at school.
 
Another way social exclusion rears its head involves racist assumptions of cognitive inferiority of black students. Evidence suggests that professors in some scientific disciplines assign black and Latino students lower grades than white students, even after controlling for variables such as SAT scores.23 Another study found that high-achieving black students are frequent targets of questions by professors around plagiarism or questions from other students about how they were admitted to school. 24 Experiencing others’ stereotyped expectations induces stress and isolates black students. It can make it even more difficult to navigate predominately (and increasingly) white settings. Experiencing discrimination can affect whether a student feels like she belongs, and it can also influence whether she stays in college altogether.25
 
This also manifests itself in the “athlete stigma,” in which black non-athletes are often assumed to be athletes or to have only made it to campus based on an athletic scholarship. The athlete stigma is delegitimizing for several reasons. The first, obviously, is that it assumes that black students could not have gotten into a college on academic qualifications alone. This is self-reinforced by the very fact that elite colleges are enrolling fewer black students, and that college is getting more expensive for working-class students.
It also inherently assumes a hierarchy of capability, in that athletes are considered inherently underachieving or cognitively inferior to other students on campus. This is based in racialized notions of intelligence26; the stereotyping of black success as being dependent on physical talent and physical attributes, rather than cognitive or mental strength, has a long, ugly history dating back to slavery. It’s also misguided: Many athletes’ schedules include full academic course loads and practices, games, and film study that are equivalent to a full-time job. The ability to display rapid critical thinking skills, solve and diagnose complex problems, memorize dozens of playbooks, and work in team settings are all things that employers—and society writ large—seek.
This is a form of hypocrisy: Certain athletes are subject to social exclusion, but other skill-based majors from the performing arts (dancing, music, and theatre) or visual arts are not. When a music major—one who may spend many hours outside of school rehearsing, practicing, or performing—enters a math or history class, she is not likely to receive the same humiliating experience that a black female basketball player cited: On the first day of class, a professor asked student athletes to stand, singling them out by saying, ""These are the people who will probably drop this class.""27
The third reason is exploitation: most student-athletes are not black, but in the case of revenue sports such as football and men’s basketball, many black student-athletes are directly responsible for generating millions of dollars in revenue for their colleges, their coaches and athletic departments, and for corporate sponsors.  As athletes have begun to organize around the notion that some of that revenue should be put back into paying student-athletes, or that those same athletes should be allowed to make money off of their likeness—in the same way that music majors can make money from playing in a band—they have faced extreme resistance from colleges, the NCAA, and their political allies. Student-athletes, we are told, are “ungrateful” and should be satisfied with their athletic scholarships and the opportunity to be on a campus on which, the implicit argument goes, they would otherwise be unwelcome.
 
The last several years have seen an increase in campus-based hate, as Figure 5 shows, and an expansion in organizing to combat it. When black students do organize around injustice, they face institutional policies and pressures that make it difficult to both meet everyday responsibilities and take the time to stand up for their rights and dignity. In taking time to protest the increase in racist activity on campus, students must skip class or work, delay studying, and in some cases miss exams, which can put much-needed financial aid in jeopardy.28

Some colleges—including George Washington University and American University in Washington, DC—have responded to the needs of student organizers, sometimes by working with professors to accommodate schedules and request coursework and exam extensions for student activists. Some have begun to rethink ways to increase diversity and inclusion on campus.29 Time will tell how committed colleges are to systemic change, and more importantly, whether they are willing to put in the long-term resources to enable students of color to succeed.
 
Addressing the underrepresentation and under-resourcing of black students in higher education is a good idea in its own right. We can also increase college attainment by providing greater public support for community colleges, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and regional 4-year institutions that educate far more students than elite, selective colleges—and moving toward a world in which no college is ever considered “under-resourced.” Doing so would simply be providing the same promise to today’s students that previous generations could take for granted.
But it is also the case that white students and families can benefit from social inclusion. First, there are documented effects on creativity, problem solving, innovation, and critical thinking skills when students learn together in diverse settings. Longitudinal studies reveal that students in racially and ethnically diverse environments show greater growth in academic skills and higher rates of academic engagement and motivation.30 At a time when employers consistently demand critical thinking, nimbleness, motivation, and people skills, increasing the pool of students and graduates of color can benefit all individuals.
Perhaps more importantly, as more students of color have wanted to go to college to better themselves, state lawmakers have cut budgets with greater ease, and federal lawmakers have not seen fit to increase financial aid in a way that would make college as inexpensive as it once was. In response, colleges can raise prices, admit more wealthy students, or cut courses and services. This negatively impacts white working- and middle-class families as well.
The lack of public or institutional investment creates a situation in which financial aid is scarce and spots are competitive, breeding resentment within an institution or across society. This scarcity is an active policy choice that harms everyone; the federal government’s unwillingness to stop tuition from outpacing the average or maximum Pell Grant impacts, for example, harms some low-income black students at HBCUs, but it also impacts the white community and technical college students who have to pick up extra work hours just to pay for books. Lawmakers cutting funding for non-selective colleges and community colleges is a precursor to cutting funds for public flagships, or not restoring funding after an economic downturn. When universities respond to budget pressures by increasing the enrollment of out-of-state students, they reduce opportunity and choice for local and in-state students, black and white alike. When a student or employee calls campus police to harass black students and black university employees, they are exacerbating an already hostile environment and wasting resources that could be spent actually ensuring safety for everyone.
So, focusing on structural inclusion can build a more cohesive and powerful narrative, one that recognizes that increasing public investment in public colleges and students is good for an entire state, and that putting more resources into those that have been starved of access or asked to “do more with less” can have positive effects for everyone.
In short, equity builds opportunity, helps students innovate and become their best selves. Finally, it is based on an understanding that the dynamics of social exclusion are not inevitable—rather they are based on a series of deliberate policy choices. What was done can be undone. By recognizing the ways in which black students must navigate a hostile, expensive, and exhausting higher education experience, we can begin to repair some of the harm done in a way that puts more resources, accountability, and attention at every level of our education system so students of all backgrounds can thrive. This switch will require organizing and listening to the communities most affected by social exclusion, and it will require putting pressure on decisionmakers to listen to the voice of today’s students.
 
College and universities, and their systems, can first and foremost look at funding formulas and disparities across institutions. States should ensure that the least-resourced institutions are no longer the same institutions educating the bulk of a state’s black population. States can and should invest in need-based financial aid programs and equitable free-college programs, and put resources into colleges that can be used for high-touch advising programs and proven strategies to help students succeed who otherwise might not.31
States should also work to “ban the box,” or prohibit colleges from asking about a potential student’s criminal history when applying to college or seeking financial aid. Due to over-policing, people of color are disproportionately likely to be arrested, particularly when it comes to drug offenses, even though white and black drug use is virtually the same; in fact, white students report higher rates of drug use in college than black students.32 Asking about drug convictions or history simply creates an inequitable barrier to applying or being admitted to college that locks students of color out. The State University of New York system, as well as the states of Louisiana and Washington,33 have begun to lead on this issue.
 
Institutions that are serious about structural inclusion can address it in several ways. The first is the admissions and recruitment process. Selective public colleges can recruit across an entire state or region and can put resources into attracting students from a wide array of backgrounds. The Supreme Court has determined that race can be used as a factor in a holistic admissions process, and institutions can act accordingly, but they should also create formal commissions and processes that examine whether students of color who may be qualified to attend are not doing so because it is not a welcoming environment. As University of Missouri student Whitney Matewe told the New York Times last year, “Being ‘the other’ in every classroom and every situation is exhausting.”34
The second is through the delivery of financial aid. To the extent that institutions supplement federal and state financial aid, they should move away from the trend of merit-based aid and invest in as much need-based grant aid as possible. This would lower the net price for working-class students of all backgrounds and could mean the difference between enrolling and not enrolling, or persisting and dropping out with debt. Incorporating knowledge of the racial wealth gap, and the causes of it, in financial aid policy and practice can help colleges target aid at those families who have been shut out of the ability to save for higher education.
Most importantly, these complex issues should be addressed with students at the table. Institutions should create formal processes that organize students of color around topics that those students deem most pressing or important. Building power among students and faculty of color can create a more balanced, and less reactive, dialogue around the role of police on campus, or how to address white students who use the police to harass other students. Giving space to student leaders to talk about injustice can also be beneficial, making it known that those protesting hate will be met with support by the college both in principle and in practice (by accommodating their academic and schedule demands). Institutions can lead on addressing gaps in social capital, linking students with black-owned businesses or organizations that can lead to employment or internships.
Social exclusion is deeply entrenched, and addressing the policies that expose and isolate students of color will take serious effort well beyond any single campus. But colleges are far from powerless. If the role of higher education is to help a student achieve their dreams, and to help a state become more dynamic and competitive, it’s time for State U to listen to the students who are only asking for a safe, welcoming environment and an equal shot at success.

Demos’ Social Exclusion series explores the relationship between individual instances of hostility towards people of color in the United States, and how that hostility is powered by our policy choices. “Social exclusion” refers to a set of decisions and actions by the economically and politically powerful to deploy racist ideas in order to further concentrate their wealth and power, and how those ideas reinforce social deprivation, economic disadvantage, and the inability to have a voice in our democracy.",research
"How the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is used in measuring our economic growth and whether alternative measures are also needed to provide a more comprehensive outlook of economic progress.
GDP measures the output of goods and services produced by labor and property located within the U.S. during a given time period.1 It was developed in the 1930s as a way for policymakers to gauge the recovery from the Great Depression.2 Reported quarterly, GDP has become the metric economists and policymakers primarily look to for analyzing the health of our economy and setting economic policy. For instance, the White House and Congress use GDP numbers to prepare the federal budget, the federal reserve uses GDP to formulate monetary policy, and business interests look to GDP as an indicator of economic activity and performance.3 However, GDP is a measure of raw economic activity, not a complete picture of economic progress. Even its chief architect, Simon Kuznets, recognized the limitations of GDP and thought it was a poor instrument for measuring economic development. GDP was never intended to become the sole measurement of the state of our economy, let alone a measure of societal progress. But in the decades after World War II, GDP has become the go-to metric for determining whether society is progressing. Our economic policy has been largely shaped by the end goal of maximizing GDP growth without consideration of what the figure does and does not measure.
The formula used to calculate GDP is:
This calculation gives the monetary value of all the goods and services purchased within national borders by persons, businesses, governments and foreigners. As a raw data analysis, GDP gives a good broad overview of the market economic activity that takes place within the U.S. However, because it does not differentiate between types of spending, and because it does not recognize non-market forms of production and values without market prices, GDP does not provide a complete picture of economic and societal progress.
For example, GDP counts just broad categories of consumption and government spending. It cannot distinguish between “good” and “bad” spending. If government spending increases due to responding to a natural disaster, like Superstorm Sandy, or if it increases due to a substantial infrastructure expansion program, there is no distinction in GDP accounting. Yet, the infrastructure program is clearly better for our overall economy and society. Likewise, if personal consumption increases, GDP counts that as a positive sign, even if the personal consumption is financed by credit cards or other means that put households in debt.
Despite being a broad measure, there are several things that GDP does not measure that are essential for both the economy and society. Most glaringly, GDP does not capture the distribution of growth and, as a result, cannot reflect inequality. Since 1979, the bottom 20 percent of earners saw their income increase by 18 percent.5 Over the same time period, the top twenty percent of earners saw their incomes increase by 65 percent and the top one percent saw their incomes increase by an astonishing 277 percent. The U.S. GDP, meanwhile, more than doubled over the last 30 years with no ability to reflect the growing income inequality. As the graph below shows, as GDP has increased, so has the level of inequality.6
Yet, this disparity is not reflected in GDP numbers. GDP cannot distinguish between a positive economic indicator, like increased spending due to more disposable income, and a negative economic indicator, like increased spending on credit cards due to loss of wages or declining real value of wages. (Since 1980, GDP per capita has increased from $25,640 to $42,722 in 20107; over the same time period, credit card debt increased by 285 percent to $3,480 per capita.8)
RELATED: Does Growth Equal Progress? The Myth of GDP
GDP also does not capture the value added by volunteer work, and does not capture the value of caring for one’s own children. For example, if a family hires someone for childcare, that counts in GDP accounting. If a parent stays home to care for their child, however, the value is not counted in GDP.
In addition, the enormous value of the country’s natural capital and ecosystems is also not reflected in GDP.9 Preserving the country’s natural resources—essential to our current and future wealth—is not counted, but exploiting them in an unsustainable manner is. only when natural resources are sold or somehow commoditized do they show up in GDP calculations. For example, if all of the fish in the sea were caught and sold in one year, global GDP would skyrocket, even though the fishing industry itself would collapse and the broader ecosystem would be damaged irrevocably. As shown below, our economic growth is increasing at a rate that cannot be ecologically sustained.
The problem with over-reliance on GDP is the role that it plays in formulating policy and setting priorities. If policymakers considered GDP only as a measure of raw market economic activity in conjunction with many other metrics, the flaws in it would be less important. If poverty rates, inequality levels, natural capital accounts, and other metrics were taken into account as heavily as GDP, then different policies and priorities would begin to emerge. Instead, we are now focused solely on increasing GDP, even though increasing poverty rates, inequality levels, and other societal indicators show that in many ways, we are experiencing growth without progress.
For example, if policymakers relied on measures of natural capital as well as GDP, the value of preserving forests as ""carbon sinks"" and air purifiers would provide economic justification for adopting policies to preserve natural resources.10 Likewise, if economists and officials considered decreasing inequality as central to economic progress, more progressive taxation and pro-worker trade policies would be more attractive.
There are several indicators that consider forms of progress ignored in GDP, such as wellness, natural capital accounting, and even gross national happiness. A more comprehensive single metric, the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), provides a complete picture of economic and social progress. Under Governor Martin O'Malley, the state of Maryland has been leading the way in adopting a GPI with the goal of integrating it into policymaking decisions.11
Maryland uses 26 indicators to calculate the state GPI. The indicators are within three categories: economic, environmental and social. The economic category indicators are similar to the state’s gross product calculations. The environmental indicators measure factors such as the costs of pollution, the cost of climate change, and the cost of net changes in natural resources. The social indicators include the value of education and volunteering and the costs of crime and lost leisure time.
Maryland’s GPI also captures the impact of income inequality on the state’s economy. The state uses the following equation to calculate Adjusted Personal Consumption:
The higher the level of income inequality is, the lower the state’s starting Adjusted Personal Consumption level. The impact of this calculation is clear: as inequality rises, this crucial measure of consumption decreases. If inequality levels were the same as in 2000, the state’s GPI would have increased 4.15 percent in 2010—instead, the GPI rose just 0.25 percent in 2010. This reality provides a strong case for policymakers to focus on decreasing the level of income inequality in the state to improve the state’s overall economic and social health.
Comparing GDP growth with GPI calculations, it becomes clear that while we are growing, we are not making progress.
Over-reliance on GDP distorts decision-making affecting our economy and society. Other metrics such as the Genuine Progress Indicator are beginning to provide a more comprehensive view of economic and social progress to use when setting national priorities. As Joseph Stiglitz stated upon release of the report of the Commission on the measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress: “What you measure affects what you do,” and if “you don’t measure the right thing, you don’t do the right thing.",research
"Methodology: Demos sponsored an online survey among 1,536 registered voters, conducted June 5 to June 14, 2017. The research included a base sample of registered voters and, for deeper analysis, oversamples of working-class African Americans, working-class Hispanics, working-class white Obama-to-Trump voters, and progressives, defined as people of all races who identify as extremely or somewhat liberal. The data in this survey is weighted by standard weights to make it fully representative.

"25 Federal Policies to Lift Up Working People
An economic agenda that places both race and class at the forefront motivates working people of all races to engage in the civic life of their communities and our nation. Such an agenda embodies race-forward progressive values, advances the policies that will move those values into practice, and activates a broad base, including the “New American Demos” of people of color, single women, young people, and working-class Americans of all races. With it, policymakers, grassroots organizations, and other thought leaders will starkly contrast an authentic, multi-racial populism against the phony populism that divides and distracts working people today.
Everyone’s Economy includes 25 policies—from providing universal childcare to protecting consumers from high-interest debt, from promoting climate equity to ending the criminalization of poverty—that contribute to a race-forward, populist agenda.This briefing book has been developed in an ongoing collaboration with grassroots organizations across the country. Each policy section briefly details the problem, summarizes national polling on the issue, and outlines a policy solution, including references to bills currently before Congress. Each section also includes messaging guidance for talking about the policy with the public, examples of how a similar policy has worked at the state or local level or would work according to studies, and links to further resources.
We have designed Everyone’s Economy as a resource for policymakers, grassroots organizations, and other thought leaders. We aim to meet 2 essential needs:
Americans recognize that corporate lobbyists, the very wealthy, and those who are beholden to them have manipulated the rules of our economy to consolidate their own power and wealth—at the expense of working people and communities. In an April 2017 survey, 73 percent of American adults agreed that “the economic system in the U.S. is rigged in favor of certain groups.” When an earlier iteration of the same survey asked which groups the economy was rigged to benefit, 86 percent agreed it was rigged for corporations and 91 percent asserted it was rigged to favor the rich. Yet it’s also clear that when cynical individuals strategically deploy racial scapegoating, they powerfully shift the focus away from combatting the concentration of wealth and corporate power; in the same survey, 49 percent of white Americans who saw the economy as rigged insisted that the U.S. economic system favors people who receive government assistance, and 35 percent said the economy is rigged in favor of minority groups. Remaining silent on racial inequities and the way that coded racial appeals underlie the major policy issues of our day fosters an environment that continues dividing Americans and undercutting our resolve to fight together for progressive solutions that work for all of us.
Of course, those beholden to the very wealthy deploy more weapons than race to divide and distract Americans. They stoke fear and anxiety about Muslims, LGBTQ people, and women’s efforts to assert equality, fueling a larger culture war that goads Americans to resent other working people rather than direct their rage at corporate greed. While this briefing book focuses on race, Demos does not shy away from confronting inequities of gender, sexual orientation, and other social cleavages that are used to oppress and divide us.
Economic justice and racial justice are not at odds—in fact, they are inextricable. To elevate the policy conversation and advance the interests of working people in 2018 and beyond, policymakers, grassroots organizations, and other thought leaders must commit to a race-forward populist economic agenda that will enable all of us to thrive.
This briefing book is a living document and will be updated. We welcome your feedback, thoughts, and suggestions via email at [email protected].

Human beings are a part of the natural world: we all have a right to clean air, water, and land in the communities where we live and raise our children. Yet corporate interests have put our health and environment at risk by continuing to extract, peddle, and burn fossil fuels. Inequitable policies and investments have long put communities of color directly in the line of impact, even as just 100 companies are responsible for 71 percent of the global fossil fuel emissions that are destroying our planet and our climate. Policymakers should invest in the nation’s transition to clean energy, end the extraction of fossil fuels, stop greenhouse gas pollution, and direct responsible recovery and building in the wake of climate events.
 
Mobility is critical to our communities’ ability to thrive. Growing numbers of Americans rely on public transit as a way to get to work, school, health care, and recreation. But much of our public transit infrastructure is old and decrepit. And many of our transit systems were not designed to handle such heavy use. Policymakers should invest in public transit to rehabilitate, modernize and expand systems so that more Americans have access to quality transportation options.
 
Americans rely on roads, bridges, airports and transit to get us where we need to go; sewer and water systems to keep our families healthy; safe and well-maintained schools, libraries, and other public buildings; and energy to power it all. Our economy depends on strong infrastructure. Yet America’s infrastructure is crumbling; our roads are congested, our bridges are deteriorating, our school buildings are dilapidated, and the pipes that carry our drinking water are in a state of disrepair. Policymakers should increase infrastructure spending to create jobs and boost the economy, with funds targeted to engage and benefit communities of color that have been historically shut out of economic growth due to discrimination and underinvestment.
 
Americans work hard, and that should provide enough to sustain our families. Yet a large share of employers structure jobs in ways that prevent working people from getting by. Today, as women and people of color make up a growing share of America’s working class, employers are weakening job standards for all working people. Policymakers should raise the standards for American jobs so that all working people get paid fairly for their efforts and have work schedules that take their basic needs into account. This policy includes a higher minimum wage, stable scheduling, paid sick time, prevention of wage theft, protections from being improperly classified as an independent contractor, and increasing the number of working people who are guaranteed overtime pay.
 
We all deserve an equal opportunity to be hired based on our abilities, and to carry out our work free from discrimination and harassment. But discriminatory hiring, firing, harassment, promotions, and pay continue to shape the U.S. labor market in ways that systematically disadvantage people of color, women, LGBTQ workers, people with disabilities, and other targeted groups. Policymakers should provide additional resources to strengthen the enforcement of existing fair employment laws and expand civil rights laws to clarify that discrimination and harassment based on sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, personal credit history, pregnancy status or caregiving responsibilities are illegal. Policymakers should also ensure that people with arrest or conviction records have a fair chance to work.
 
Our American tradition guarantees working people the freedom to join together with co-workers to negotiate for a fair return on work. When workers have the freedom to band together in unions and negotiate with their employers, they and their families gain from improved wages and benefits, safer working conditions, and fairer treatment on the job. Yet because unions successfully enable working people to build power, the freedom to come together in unions is under attack by corporate interests aiming to maximize their own wealth and power. Policymakers should restore workers’ freedom to join together in unions and negotiate for a fair return on work.
 
Every American who wants to work should have the opportunity to work. And our communities and nation have work to do: building, caring, educating, healing, protecting, and much more. But today, too many private employers are failing to provide enough good jobs. At the same time, politicians touting “austerity” have slashed public jobs, which have long been a path to financial stability for working people, especially people of color. Policymakers should guarantee a public job with the federal government as an employer of last resort for working Americans who are without college education, involuntarily unemployed, poorly paid or under-employed, or out of the workforce. Policymakers should prioritize racial equity in the program design to repair systemic limitations to opportunity for people of color.
 
At some point in our lives, we all need time to care for loved ones or ourselves, whether we are bonding with a new child, caring for an ailing parent, or recovering from a serious personal illness. Yet in 2017, only 13 percent of private sector workers had access to paid family leave through their employer. Policymakers should provide paid benefits to working people who need time away from their jobs to care for a new child, a loved one with a serious health condition, or their own serious health condition.
 
Higher education has the potential to be a great equalizer and a pathway to a better life. As wages and wealth have continued to decline for those with a high-school diploma, a college degree has become an insurance policy for many families, a way to achieve some financial security. But just as more Americans pursue this aspiration, the dramatically rising cost of college—particularly at public institutions, which have traditionally been the most affordable and accessible—is eroding this pathway to security. Policymakers should guarantee debt-free college by creating a new federal-state partnership to increase state funding for public 2- and 4-year colleges, guaranteeing that the total price of attending college is no more than what working and middle-class students can reasonably pay with a part-time job, and increasing the availability of need-based aid for low-income students.
 
Americans have long valued education as a pathway to greater opportunity and economic security. No one in America should face insurmountable financial hardship to get an education. Yet the increase in student debt over the past 15 years is one of the most staggering phenomena in the U.S. economy. Total student loan debt is $1.4 trillion and rising with no end in sight, weighing down millions of Americans. Policymakers should promote fairness for student borrowers by prohibiting garnishment to repay student loans, providing an easy path to loan forgiveness for borrowers who have been defrauded or deceived by predatory colleges, expanding loan forgiveness programs for public service workers, and ensuring the opportunity to discharge student loan debt in bankruptcy.
 
The courthouse doors should be open to everyone. When we are caught in legal proceedings that could cause us to lose our homes, families, or ability to live in the country, we should have access to an attorney who can stand up for our most basic rights. However, legal representation is only guaranteed in criminal cases, despite the devastating ramifications of many civil cases. In other circumstances, corporations force employees and customers into binding arbitration, denying individuals who are cheated or discriminated against their day in court. Policymakers should increase access to justice in the civil legal system by increasing funding for the Legal Services Corporation and increasing eligibility for aid, implementing regulations to ensure that everyone is provided an attorney in deportation proceedings, and banning forced arbitration agreements.
 
All Americans should feel safe and protected in their communities. But our criminal justice policies promote mass incarceration and over-policing, rather than real investments in public safety. As a result of harsh sentences, over-criminalization, and discriminatory policing, our criminal justice system is tearing apart families—disproportionately immigrant families and families of color. Policymakers should allocate federal funds to assist states in investing in programs that address the root causes of crime and incarceration, including amending sentencing laws, modifying prison and jail release practices, and improving access to community services that can help reduce recidivism. Policymakers should also end the mass detention of immigrants.
 
Every one of us should be treated equally under the law. The idea is so fundamental to our justice system that it is carved above the doors of the Supreme Court. Yet every day, criminal justice policies penalize people for being poor. When people who are unable to pay bail, fines, and fees are forced to remain in jail or take on debt for their involvement in the justice system, it tears families apart and contributes to a cycle of poverty while doing little to increase public safety. Policymakers should provide incentives for state and local governments to end the use of money bail and to reduce and eliminate fines, fees, and other mechanisms through which our justice system criminalizes poverty.
 
The true source of America’s greatness is the diversity of our people. Throughout our history, the nation has grown and thrived when we have welcomed the skills, talents, and perspectives of immigrants and embraced their potential to contribute to our shared prosperity. But our immigration system is badly broken. For 11 million people who are undocumented—the great majority of whom are people of color—it is currently impossible to become citizens. Millions of others qualify for legal status in the United States but face complex barriers that hold them back from joining our country and making even greater contributions to our society. Policymakers should fix America’s broken immigration system so that people have an opportunity to get legal status, so they can contribute and participate more fully in our economy and society.   
 
When a child is injured or a loved one is suffering from a serious illness, no one wants to think about co-pays and deductibles. We want compassionate, effective medical care, delivered quickly and accessibly. Yet ideologically-driven politicians continue to threaten recent gains to health care access in the United States. Many Americans continue to struggle to obtain the health care they need and the assurance that they won’t go bankrupt if they get sick. People of color, undocumented people and low-income Americans all suffer disproportionately under our current health coverage scheme. Policymakers should establish universal health coverage in America, so that everyone can access health care.
 
A home is more than a roof over our heads. It’s the opportunity to raise our families in a safe neighborhood with clean air and water, and to live in a place where we can access good jobs, efficient transportation, and high-quality schools. Each year, the federal government spends nearly $200 billion to support housing in this country—yet as millions of Americans struggle to find and hold onto homes they can afford, the vast majority of our public funds for housing are directed to subsidize the nation’s wealthiest households. Policymakers should rebalance the nation’s housing investments so that resources go to people who need them most.
 
There is perhaps no greater decision impacting families’ economic security than decisions about whether and when to have children. Given the gravity of these decisions and their impact on the lives of countless women and their families, equal access to affordable, accessible reproductive health services, including abortion, is critical. Policymakers should safeguard the economic security of women and their families by ensuring that health plans include reproductive health coverage and working to expand coverage of abortion services by Medicaid and other federal health insurance programs.
 
Family comes first. That means all families should have access to affordable and high-quality choices for their children's early care and education. Millions of American parents need child care to be able to work or go to school, while children need quality care and education to get a strong beginning in life. Yet child care costs have soared in the past decade, leaving a growing number of working and middle-class families unable to afford the early learning and care that will enable their children to thrive. Policymakers should guarantee universal access to affordable, high-quality child care and preschool programs for all American families, and improve compensation and training for child care workers.
 
In a country as wealthy as the United States, families should not go to bed hungry, shiver in an unheated home, or be out on the streets as they search for a new job. Throughout our history, we have valued public programs that protect basic living standards for our fellow Americans and enable us to get back on our feet when we fall on hard times. Programs including Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, Unemployment Insurance, Supplemental Security Income, Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, and the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program provide critical support for households facing economic hardship, stabilize families’ access to necessities, and keep millions of Americans out of poverty. Policymakers should expand funding for safety net programs, increase benefit levels, and eliminate limits on the ability of families to save money or own assets in order to receive public benefits.
 
People who work for a living should be able to earn a decent income. But millions of working people across the country are struggling to make ends meet, as corporations have held down wages and the gap between the haves and have-nots continues to widen. Policymakers should expand the eligibility criteria and value of the EITC to help more working Americans and their families earn a decent living.
 
Fair and affordable access to credit is crucial for American consumers and our economy. Yet today, predatory lenders target low-income communities and communities of color with high-interest loans that trap many of the most disadvantaged consumers in debt. Today 12 million Americans take out payday loans each year, spending more than $9 billion on loan fees. Payday and car title lenders disproportionately target low-income neighborhoods with high populations of people of color, promoting quick-fix loans with annual interest rates of nearly 400 percent on average. Policymakers should cap fees and interest rates for all lending, enacting a set of national usury limits that would be floating and tiered based on the type of loan. Policymakers should also act to defend the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
 
After a lifetime of hard work, we should all be able to retire with dignity. But millions of working Americans will face significant income shortfalls in retirement, creating a crisis of unprecedented levels. All three pillars of Americans’ retirement security—Social Security, a pension or employer-sponsored retirement plan, and personal savings—face serious threats in a country where wealth and economic power are increasingly concentrated in a few hands. Policymakers should enable working Americans to retire in dignity by both strengthening workplace retirement accounts and expanding Social Security.
 
All of us together can do what any of us alone cannot. Currently, our tax policy is upside down, with the wealthiest Americans getting the most government assistance in building wealth, and the poorest getting the least. At a time when our infrastructure is crumbling, when aid for public colleges and universities is being cut, and when too many Americans are being priced out of health insurance, politicians beholden to wealthy donors seek to reduce the taxes of the wealthy and of corporations. Policymakers should make our tax structure fair by reducing the estate tax exemption and raising the estate tax rate, taxing investment income at the same rate as income from work, and closing corporate tax loopholes.
 
All of us should have the resources we need to care for our families. Our financial system can facilitate this by operating as a utility that pools and distributes risk and resources so that we can all share in the prosperity that we help generate. Yet a wave of deregulation threatens a return to the risky behavior by big banks that cost millions of Americans their jobs, homes, and retirement savings during the financial crisis. Private equity is especially problematic, because it focuses exclusively on investors’ interests, holding onto rewards for investors and offloading risk to the workers and communities of the companies they buy. Policymakers should ensure that private equity pools and distributes financial risk and resources to achieve shared prosperity and sustainable growth, by specifying and strengthening the rules for private equity, closing tax loopholes that incentivize extreme risk taking, and updating employment and bankruptcy laws to ensure that private equity firms are less able to offload risk onto working people.
 
When American businesses compete on a level playing field, consumers benefit from higher quality products, more innovation, greater access to services, and better prices. Small business owners have a chance to innovate and serve their communities, and working people have a better opportunity to get a fair deal on the job. Yet over the past 3 decades, policymakers permitted corporate giants to take over an ever-increasing share of our economy, enabling corporations to enrich themselves and their executives at the expense of millions of consumers, workers, and innovative would-be competitors. Policymakers should block corporate consolidation that benefits companies at the expense of the public.

"Both economic and racial justice are core progressive priorities, but too often we discuss them separately.

Our base, which includes many people of color, is deeply concerned about racism. Failing to address racial concerns or merely tacking them onto economic ones leaves our base unmotivated to engage, let alone persuade others. Meanwhile, most persuadables feel deep concern about race. They toggle between contradictory orientations—one that views talking about race as necessary and desires racial fairness and progressive values; and another that considers conversations about race problematic and pulls  them toward racial resentment and conservative fears. The notion that we must avoid race with the middle is wrong: Remaining silent on race helps our opposition’s toxic worldview gain primacy.
The right villainizes immigrants and African Americans as undeserving and even dangerous in order to diminish the social solidarity and support for collective action that form the foundation of the progressive agenda. Pointing out this strategic racism and tying it to the class war that a handful of wealthy reactionaries are waging helps connect the experiences of targeted people of color to those of economically anxious white people. It provides a way for people of all races to understand our noxious racial environment and makes clear that white people will gain more from cross-racial solidarity than from siding with race-baiting billionaires.
Making division the central problem seeds desire for unity as the response. However,  it also leaves us vulnerable to claims that we too sow division. We must provide frequent endorsements for coming together, including references to having done so in the past, when calling out opponents for intentional division. “Joining together across racial differences” as a route to secure a better future moved both base and persuadables toward support for a progressive agenda.",research

"26 state policies for a race-forward, populist agenda to empower all Americans
The promise of America is that each of us has an equal say in our democracy and an equal chance in our economy. In Everyone’s America: State Policies for an Equal Say in Our Democracy and an Equal Chance in Our Economy, we offer an inclusive, race-forward, working-class platform that policymakers, grassroots organizations, and community members can move in their states to help achieve this vision. The progressive economic agenda centers both race and class, and motivates working people of all races to engage in the civic life of their communities and our nation. The inclusive democracy agenda breaks down barriers to meaningful participation and representation, and creates a democracy that is of, by, and for the people—and not just the wealthy special interests. These 2 key objectives support each other: With equal representation in our democracy, we will help ensure that the benefits of our economy are shared fairly; and with a more balanced economy, we will help ensure that Americans across race and class can fully and fairly participate in our democracy. 
With equal representation in our democracy, we will help ensure that the benefits of our economy are shared fairly; and with a more balanced economy, we will help ensure that Americans across race and class can fully and fairly participate in our democracy. 
Taken together, this suite of policies advances progressive values and activates a broad base, including the “New American Demos” of people of color, single women, young people, and working-class Americans of all races. The inclusive, multi-racial populism that these policies embody stands in stark contrast to the phony populism that today divides, distracts, and disempowers working people, and people of color in particular. 
With national politics tangled in scandal and stalemate, this work at the state level is more vital than ever. Not only can real progressive policies take shape on the state level, they can take root and blossom into national action in the future.
Everyone’s America lays out 26 policies—from raising job standards to protecting consumers from high-interest debt, from modernizing voter registration and making it more inclusive to shifting power from wealthy donors to working people—that contribute to a race-forward, populist agenda and empower all Americans to participate more fully in our democracy. We have developed this briefing book through partnerships with grassroots organizations across the country. 
Each policy section briefly details the problem, summarizes national polling on the issue, and outlines recommended policy solutions. Since each state faces different challenges, opportunities, and legal, economic, political, and geographic conditions, no single solution will suit every state, and each briefing offers a variety of policy options. Each section also includes messaging guidance for talking about the policy with the public, examples of how similar policies have worked in other states or cities or would work according to studies, and links to further resources. 
Everyone’s America is a resource for policymakers, grassroots organizations, and other leaders, aimed at meeting 3 essential needs:
Americans recognize that corporations and the very wealthy—and the politicians who are beholden to them—have manipulated the rules of our economy and our democracy to consolidate their own wealth and power, at the expense of working people and communities. In a 2017 survey, 73 percent of American adults agreed that, “The economic system in the U.S. is rigged in favor of certain groups.”1 When an earlier iteration of the same survey asked which groups the economy was rigged to benefit, 86 percent stated it was rigged for corporations and 91 percent asserted it was rigged to favor the rich.2 Across partisan lines, a supermajority of Americans (94 percent) agreed that money in politics and wealthy donors are sources of political dysfunction, and that the wealthy have more power over politicians than constituents do.  
Politicians backed by an elite donor class have long deployed racism to make wealthy Americans richer and working Americans more divided, and this strategy is alive and well today. In the same survey, 49 percent of white Americans who believe the economy is rigged said the system favors people who receive government assistance, and 35 percent said the economy is rigged in favor of minority groups—which could not be further from the truth.3 Remaining silent on racial injustice and the way that coded racist appeals underlie the major policy issues of our day enables those who deliberately divide us, and undercuts our power to win solutions that work for all of us.
Of course, those beholden to the very wealthy deploy more weapons than race to divide and distract Americans. They stoke fear and anxiety about Muslims, LGBTQ people, and women’s efforts to assert equality, fueling a larger culture war that goads working-class Americans to resent one another and fear the political empowerment of fellow working people rather than direct their rage at corporate greed. While this briefing book focuses on race, Demos does not shy away from confronting inequities of gender and gender identity, sexual orientation, and other social cleavages that are used to oppress and divide us.
Political, economic, and racial justice are interconnected, and we must pursue them together. To elevate the policy conversation and advance the interests of working people in 2018 and beyond, state-level policymakers, grassroots organizations, and other thought leaders must commit to a race-forward economic and pro-democracy agenda that will allow all of us to thrive.
This briefing book is a living document and will be updated. We welcome your feedback, thoughts, and suggestions via email at [email protected].

Human beings are a part of the natural world: We all need clean air, water, and land in the communities where we live and raise our children. Yet corporate interests have put our health and environment at risk by continuing to extract, peddle, and burn fossil fuels. Skewed policies and dependence on yesterday’s technologies have long put communities of color directly in the line of impact, even as just 100 companies are responsible for 71 percent of the global fossil fuel emissions that are destroying our communities and our climate. State policymakers should invest in an equitable transition to clean energy, end the extraction of fossil fuels, stop greenhouse gas pollution, and direct responsible recovery and building in the wake of climate events.
 
Mobility is critical to our communities’ ability to thrive. Growing numbers of Americans rely on public transit to get to work, school, health care, and recreation. However, much of our transit infrastructure is old and deteriorating; many communities lack access to reliable and affordable transportation options; and many of our transit systems were not designed to handle such heavy use. State policymakers should invest in public transit to fix, modernize and expand systems so that more Americans have access to quality transportation options. Revenue sources for transit should favor progressive taxes, since low-income households are disproportionately hurt by increases in user fees and fares.
 
Invest In Infrastructure
Americans rely on roads, bridges, airports and transit to get us where we need to go; sewer and water systems to keep our families healthy; safe and well-maintained schools, libraries, and other public buildings; and energy to power it all. Our economy depends on strong infrastructure. Yet America’s infrastructure is crumbling; our roads are congested, our bridges are deteriorating, our school buildings are dilapidated, and the pipes that carry our drinking water are in a state of disrepair. State policymakers should increase infrastructure spending to create good jobs and boost the economy, with funds targeted to engage and benefit communities of color that have been historically shut out of economic growth due to discrimination and underinvestment.
 
Americans work hard, and that should provide enough to sustain our families. Yet too many employers structure jobs in ways that prevent working people from being able to get by. Today, as women and people of color make up a growing share of America’s working class, employers are weakening job standards for all working people. State policymakers should raise the standards for American jobs so that all working people get paid fairly for their efforts and have work schedules that take their basic needs into account. Vital elements include a higher minimum wage, stable scheduling, paid sick time, prevention of wage theft, protections from being improperly classified as an independent contractor, and increasing the number of working people who are guaranteed overtime pay. 
 
We all deserve an equal opportunity to be hired based on our abilities and to work free of discrimination and harassment. However, discriminatory hiring, firing, harassment, promotions, and pay continue to block opportunity for people of color, women, LGBTQ workers, people with disabilities, and other targeted groups. State policymakers should provide additional resources to strengthen enforcement of existing fair employment laws and expand civil rights laws to clarify that discrimination and harassment based on sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, personal credit history, pregnancy status or caregiving responsibilities are illegal. Policymakers should also ensure that people with arrest or conviction records have a fair chance to work.
 
Our American tradition guarantees working people the freedom to join together with co-workers to negotiate for a fair return on work. When workers have the freedom to band together in unions and negotiate with their employers, they and their families gain from improved wages and benefits, safer working conditions, and fairer treatment on the job. Yet because unions successfully enable working people to build power, the freedom to come together in unions is under attack by corporate interests aiming to maximize their own wealth and power. State policymakers should restore workers’ freedom to join together in unions by eliminating so-called “right to work” laws, expanding freedom to negotiate to public employees and other workers left out of federal labor law, leveraging state purchasing power, and banning non-compete agreements.
 
At some point in our lives, we all need time to care for loved ones or ourselves, whether we are bonding with a new child, caring for an ailing parent, or recovering from a serious personal illness. Yet in 2017, only 13 percent of private sector workers had access to paid family leave through their employer. Without paid time away from work, Americans put their health at risk, face economic hardship, and are unable to care for those who matter most to them in a time of need. State policymakers should set up a system to provide paid benefits to working people who need time away from their jobs to care for a new child, a loved one with a serious health condition, or their own serious health condition.
 
Parents want the best start for their children. In fact, our entire society benefits when children enter kindergarten with a strong educational foundation and when parents can go to work knowing their children are participating in the early learning that will enable them to thrive. Yet even as the benefits of preschool grow increasingly clear, policymakers in many states have failed to invest in providing preschool to all kids regardless of family wealth. At the same time, preschool teachers who do the crucial work of educating young children are typically paid such low wages that they struggle to sustain their own families. State policymakers should guarantee universal, voluntary access to high-quality public preschool programs for all 3- and 4-year-olds, and improve compensation and training for preschool teachers. 
 
Equal opportunity is a cornerstone of the American ideal. To make that a reality, every child deserves a quality public education, with an opportunity to learn, flourish, and become a full citizen of our democracy. This commitment to universal education is enshrined in state constitutions across the country. Yet in practice, the majority of states provide students with dramatically unequal educational resources and fail to adequately fund schools that serve students of color and students from struggling families. Students are increasingly clustered in schools that are isolated by race and class, and racialized disciplinary policies result in students of color being disproportionately suspended or expelled. State policymakers should change funding formulas to ensure adequate and equitable school funding, promote school integration, create community schools that provide enhanced services and engage parents and the broader community, respect and compensate teachers as professionals, and prevent schools from moving students into the juvenile justice system for minor offenses.
 
In America, we should all have the opportunity to dream big, develop our potential, and realize our greatest aspirations, and that means making our public colleges affordable to all of us. At a time of persistent racial and economic inequality, many Americans envision higher education as a pathway to a better life, regardless of race, gender, or class. But just as more Americans pursue this aspiration, the rising cost of college and the specter of large student loan debt—particularly at public institutions, which have traditionally been the most affordable and accessible—are eroding this pathway to security. State policymakers should increase per-student support for public 2- and 4-year colleges so that the total price of attending college—including tuition, fees, room and board and other living expenses—is no more than what working and middle-class students can reasonably pay with need-based grant aid and a part-time job.
 
The courthouse doors should be open to everyone. When we are caught in legal proceedings that could cause us to lose our homes, families, or ability to live in the country, we should have access to an attorney who can stand up for our most basic rights. However, legal representation is only guaranteed in criminal cases, despite the devastating ramifications of many civil cases. In other circumstances, corporations force employees and customers into binding arbitration, denying individuals who are cheated or discriminated against their day in court. State policymakers should increase access to justice in the civil legal system by expanding access to legal aid services, ensuring that people facing deportation have access to an attorney, and enabling Americans to access the courts despite forced arbitration agreements.
 
All Americans should feel safe and protected in their communities. But our criminal justice policies promote mass incarceration and over-policing, rather than actual public safety. As a result of harsh sentences, over-criminalization, and discriminatory policing, our criminal justice system is tearing apart families—disproportionately immigrant families and families of color. State policymakers should reject costly over-incarceration and invest in programs that address the root causes of crime, including amending sentencing laws, modifying prison and jail release practices, and improving access to community services that can help reduce recidivism. Policymakers should also act to end the use of private prisons and curtail cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.
 
Every one of us should be treated equally under the law. This idea is so fundamental to our justice system that it is carved above the doors of the Supreme Court. Yet every day, criminal justice policies penalize people for being poor. People who are unable to pay bail, fines, and fees are forced to remain in jail or take on debt for their involvement in the justice system, contributing to a cycle of poverty and tearing families apart. State policymakers should guarantee that people are not held in jail before trial because of an inability to pay, and should reduce and eliminate fines, fees, and other ways our justice system criminalizes poverty.
 
When a child is injured or a loved one is suffering from a serious illness, no one wants to think about co-pays and deductibles. We want compassionate, effective medical care, delivered quickly and accessibly. Yet ideologically driven politicians continue to threaten recent gains to health care access in the United States. Many Americans still struggle to get the health care they need and to know that they won’t go bankrupt if they get sick. People of color, undocumented people and low-income Americans all suffer disproportionately under our current health coverage scheme. State policymakers should expand Medicaid and take advantage of other options under the Affordable Care Act to extend health care to all residents.
 
A home is more than a roof over our heads. It’s the opportunity to raise our families in a safe neighborhood with clean air and water, and to live in a place where we can access good jobs, efficient transportation, and high-quality schools. Yet there is no county in the nation where a full-time worker earning the minimum wage can afford to rent a modest two-bedroom home, and even a one-bedroom is out of reach in most of the country. State policymakers should invest in affordable housing including state housing trust funds, encourage localities to bundle federal grants to address the affordable housing crisis, and strengthen and expand homeownership programs.
 
Making their own decisions about whether and when to have children is critical to the economic security of women and their families. Having a child is one of life’s most serious commitments, economically and otherwise. An unintended pregnancy can upend financial stability, making it difficult for mothers in particular to pursue education and maintain employment. Equal access to affordable, accessible reproductive health services, including abortion, is critical. State policymakers should guarantee insurance coverage of a full range of contraceptive methods and services as well as coverage for abortion, and should eliminate obstructive restrictions on abortion providers.
 
To live up to America’s deepest values of human dignity and equality, we must protect and expand our social safety net. Families should not go to bed hungry, be out on the streets as they search for a new job, or lay awake at night wondering how they will afford child care. Throughout our history, we have valued public programs that protect basic living standards for our fellow Americans and enable us to get back on our feet when we fall on hard times. Programs including Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Unemployment Insurance (UI), Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) provide much-needed support for households facing economic hardship, stabilize families’ access to necessities and care, and keep millions of Americans out of poverty. State policymakers should expand eligibility and state funding for safety net programs, remove punitive requirements and restrictions on accessing programs, and allow struggling families to save money or own assets while receiving public benefits.
 
Fair and affordable access to credit is vital for American consumers and our economy. Yet today, predatory lenders target low-income communities and communities of color with high-interest loans that trap many of the most disadvantaged consumers in debt. Each year, 12 million Americans take out payday loans, spending more than $9 billion on fees. Payday and car title lenders target low-income neighborhoods with high populations of people of color, promoting quick-fix loans with annual interest rates of nearly 400 percent on average. State policymakers should curb predatory installment loans, cap interest rates, limit loan fees, and require lenders to evaluate a borrower’s ability to repay all loans.
 
We pay taxes because all of us together can do what any of us alone cannot. But our tax policy is upside down, with low- and middle-income Americans paying a higher proportion of their incomes in taxes than high-income Americans. At a time when our infrastructure is crumbling, when aid for public colleges and universities is being cut, and when federal lawmakers are threatening the safety net, states urgently need to protect and expand their revenues. State policymakers should stabilize state resources in the face of federal tax changes and make income taxes more progressive by raising taxes at the top of the income ladder, collecting estate and inheritance taxes, taxing investment income at the same rate as income from work, and closing corporate tax loopholes.
 
Investment enables our communities to thrive. Traditionally, banks provided up-front investments in local businesses and public projects. In recent decades, however, federal policymakers  de-regulated the financial industry. Traditional banking, which focused on caretaking of deposits and lending to businesses and individuals, was transformed into a high-risk, high-reward wealth machine for a tiny elite. The “financialization” of our economy is crippling long-term innovation and job creation in the real economy, as community banks fail and small businesses cannot access the credit they need. State policymakers should establish a publicly run state partnership bank to support community banks and make loans that address needs in the real economy, offsetting the financial imbalances created by Wall Street.

We need a government that is of, by, and for the people—not just the wealthy donors. People from all walks of life should be able to run for office and win. When a political donor class that is wealthier, whiter, and more male than the rest of us has the biggest say in who gets elected, the result is a democracy that is not reflective of We the People. State policymakers should pass and fund public financing programs that allow candidates without deep pockets to compete at every stage of the election cycle. Programs should be designed to amplify the voices of everyday people and to advance racial equity.
 
When ultra-wealthy individuals and profit-seeking corporations can pour millions into state elections, they drown out everyone else and thwart the will of the people. Historically marginalized communities bear the brunt of this imbalance: job quality and standards diminish, while wealth accrues to the top 1 percent; public infrastructure deteriorates, while oil pipelines are built at the expense of the environmental health of Native Americans and other communities of color; and investments in education and social services shrink, while public spending to incarcerate people in private prisons soars. State policymakers should limit campaign contributions and prohibit corporations from contributing; rein in sham vehicles for big-money spending like single-candidate Super PACs; and strengthen disclosure requirements and enforcement. Over the horizon, policymakers should push for a Supreme Court that will respect our freedom to limit the influence of big money in politics or amend the U.S. Constitution to restore power to the people. 
 
Though voter registration is the on-ramp to participating in elections, nearly 1 in 4 eligible voters is not registered. Voters of color and low-income voters are registered at even lower rates, due to a long history and persistent practice of exclusion from our democracy. Outdated voter registration systems that rely on paper forms and early, arbitrary registration deadlines make voter registration much harder than it needs to be. States should harness technological advances to modernize the voter registration process; offer accessible, online voter registration, and use information already on file with state agencies to automatically register eligible individuals to vote and update their voter information; allow voters to register and cast their ballot on the same day, during early voting and on Election Day; and pre-register eligible 16- and 17-year-olds to vote.
 
In a democracy, our votes are our voice. Yet in many parts of the country, voting times, places, and forms are so restrictive that they impose often insurmountable hurdles to exercising our fundamental freedom to vote. For instance, state laws limiting voting to a single Tuesday, or restricting who can vote absentee (in person or by mail), block eligible voters from casting their ballots. Voters with disabilities and limited English proficiency often face additional hurdles, including polling sites and ballots that are not compliant with laws designed to protect these voters’ freedom to cast a private, independent ballot. Policymakers should create robust voting options both before and on Election Day; ensure that polling hours and locations are accessible to all eligible voters, including working poor people and people who rely on public transit; and guarantee that all polling sites, ballots, and other voting materials are fully accessible for voters with disabilities and limited English proficiency.
 
The answer to the question “Who can vote?” tells you who has a voice in a democracy. Today, more than 6.1 million Americans are barred from voting by state laws that disenfranchise individuals convicted of felonies. Like Jim Crow laws, these voter disenfranchisement laws disempower people of color (particularly African Americans) by linking our right to vote to a criminal legal system that is deeply infected by racism. And, while incarcerated individuals are stripped of their voices in our democracy, they are nevertheless counted for the purposes of drawing voting maps—but as part of the districts in which they are confined, and not the districts they call home. States must abolish felony disenfranchisement laws and restore voting rights to people who have been stripped of their right to vote by such laws; require corrections agencies, including parole boards and probation offices, to offer voter registration and voting services; and draw voting maps using data that counts incarcerated people at their home addresses, not where they are confined.
 
Too often, election rules undermine the power of everyday people to elect officials who will represent their interests. Partisan and race-based gerrymandering, the use of at-large districts that dilute the representation of people of color, and the Electoral College all prevent people across the United States from having an equal say in our democracy, and actively devalue the participation of parts of the electorate. Some states also use laws (sometimes dubbed “emergency manager” laws) to divest locally elected officials of power and appoint an unelected decision-maker in a community to which they are not accountable. States must establish independent redistricting commissions to draw voting maps and stop drawing winner-take-all, at-large districts. States must also ensure that government officials are responsive to the people they represent, by overhauling “emergency manager” and similar laws, and adopting mechanisms like fusion voting that make candidates more responsive and accountable to a broader range of people.

"In order to return employment to pre-recession levels and restore consumer demand, millions of additional jobs must be created. At the pace of current job creation, it would take many years to reach full employment.
This report makes the case that we should create jobs for the unemployed directly and immediately in public employment programs that produce useful goods and services for the public’s benefit.
The public sector can directly create jobs quickly, serve vital community needs and target those hurt most in this economy.

"One hundred and fifty years after the Reconstruction Amendments and more than a generation after the civil rights revolution, achieving true racial equity remains a central challenge of our time. Both structural barriers and racially biased policies contribute to a racial wealth and income gap that is higher today than at any point since the Federal Reserve began tracking it 30 years ago. And the drive for racial equity in America faces a serious headwind: the role of private wealth and big business in our political system. The undemocratic role of big money is especially exclusionary for people of color, who are severely underrepresented in the “donor class” whose large contributions fuel campaigns and therefore set the agendas in Washington and state capitals across the country. 
Race intersects with our big money system in two important ways. First, because donor and corporate interests often diverge significantly from those of working families on economic policies such as the minimum wage and paid sick leave, people of color are disproportionately harmed because a larger percentage are poor or working class. Second, and more profound, our nation’s legacy of racism and persistently racialized politics depresses the political power of people of color, creating opportunities for exploitation and targeting—exemplified by the subprime lending crisis, mass incarceration, and voter suppression laws. The dominance of big money in our politics makes it far harder for people of color to exert political power and effectively advocate for their interests as both wealth and power are consolidated by a small, very white, share of the population.
Summarized below are this study’s findings on (1) the racial bias inherent in our big-money political system; (2) our policy recommendations on how to make government more responsive to all people; and (3) five case studies detailing the real-world impact of money in politics on people of color and examples of how to shift power from wealthy interests to all voters.
 
 
The pathway to a fairer country is through a stronger democracy. A key to promoting economic mobility and racial justice for people of color is to give these communities more say over the decisions that affect their daily lives. 
To accomplish this we need to both curb the influence of the wealthy, white “donor class” and amplify the voices of all Americans, including people of color, so that elected officials will listen to and work for all of their constituents, not just a privileged few. This requires reclaiming our Constitution from a runaway Supreme Court and matching small political contributions with public funds.
In cases such as Buckley v. Valeo, Citizens United v. FEC, and McCutcheon v. FEC, the Supreme Court has stepped in to dismantle democratically-enacted policies intended to prevent wealthy interests from translating economic might directly into political power.
The best way to encourage candidates to listen to constituents and help people of color have their voices heard in the political process is to match small contributions with public funds.
 
Fundamental change is always difficult to achieve, but momentum is growing for several reasons. The silver lining of the Supreme Court’s extreme interventions on money in politics has been unprecedented public awareness and concern. A growing list of civil rights, environmental, workers’ rights and other progressive organizations are coming together to embrace the insight that enacting transformative change around their first priority issues requires strengthening our democracy and reducing the role of big money. Public support for common sense solutions remains exceptionally strong across party and ideological lines. There have been important recent victories, with the prospects for bigger wins on the horizon. Together, these factors provide real cause for optimism in the face of a daunting problem.
 
Three case studies demonstrate how big money thwarts progress on racial equity; a fourth shows how a fairer system for electing public officials can lead to policies that better serve our communities; and a fifth tells the story of how a community-based organization is building the power of people of color to fight back. And, the stories illustrate the two basic ways race interacts with our big money system.  The first two case studies examine how the power of big money combined with systemic racism has fueled two of the most destructive policies targeted toward people of color: the prison industrial complex and predatory mortgage lending.  The third and fourth case studies examine two ostensibly race-neutral policies—the minimum wage and paid sick days—that have disproportionate impact on the lives of people of color, who are over-represented among the working class.

"How Last Minute, Just-In-Time Scheduling Practices Are Bad for Workers, Families and Business
""Workplace flexibility"" is the buzz phrase in debates about how to help busy parents better juggle the competing demands of work and family. But the public conversation has been shaped largely by the experiences of professional workers. Low-wage workers face a different set of challenges -- they are much more likely to be paid hourly, work less than full time, and have erratic schedules with little advance notice of when they are expected to work. Widely used in the service industry, Just-in-Time scheduling results in last minute schedule changes with employers even sending workers home after they arrive for work or asking them to stay beyond the end of their shift. This brief examines the rise of JIT scheduling, what it looks like in practice, its effects on workers and their families, and what it means for business. It ends with a set of policy recommendations that would better balance the needs of workers and employers.

"Why over a lifetime, 401k fees can cost a median-income two-earner family nearly $155,000 and consume nearly one-third of their investment returns.
Though your retirement or bank accounts statements contain no evidence of it, everyone who has an IRA, 401k, or any other individual retirement savings account pays a variety of fees every year. But because these fees are taken “off the top” of investment returns or share prices accountholders generally have no idea how much all of this is costing them.
These fees can be substantial: over a lifetime, fees can cost a median-income two-earner family nearly $155,000 and consume nearly one-third of their investment returns. Worse, these fees are often excessive and financial services companies can get away with charging higher-than-necessary fees for a number of reasons, namely: the savers’ lack of information, the inefficiency of financial markets and individualized investing, and the substantial costs—both in money and time—associated with switching between investment brokers.
This brief sheds light on the hidden costs of 401(k)-type individual retirement plans, details the different types of fees paid by the consumers, and uses an example investment from Demos’ own 401(k) plan to illustrate these fees’ heavy burden on the average account-holder. Using industry data on fees, the brief estimates the high costs of 401(k) fees to a model family over a lifetime of saving for retirement. The brief also explains the causes of the nearly universal excessive fees that investment firms charge to savers, and argues for a wholesale reform of this country’s broken private retirement system.

"A picture of the current state of the private retirement system, why this picture bodes ill for the future of retirement in the country, and why that system needs reform.
The retirement security of American families has crumbled in the past generation. Workers retiring in the next 20 years can expect to receive only 65 percent during retirement of what they made during their working years, a drop of 16 percent from their parents. Foreboding economic forecasts suggest that young workers today could be on even shakier ground. 
Much of the decline in retirement security is due to the shift in the private sector from providing retirement benefits through traditional pensions, which guaranteed a lifetime stream of income at retirement, to less secure individual retirement accounts, whose benefits vary with the size of employer and employee contributions, and the volatile swings of the stock market. This report provides a picture of the current state of the US' private retirement system, breaks down why this picture bodes ill for the future of retirement in the country, and discusses why that system needs reform.",research
"Climate change will cause shifts in temperature and weather patterns that will significantly impact Nevada’s tourist industry and further stress its critical water supplies. To prevent even more extensive and rapid climate change, Nevada’s leaders and voters should support state, regional, national and international policies to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Such policies will not only help prevent serious damages but also promote development of Nevada’s abundant renewable energy resources.
According to a nation-wide Gallup poll on economic confidence in August 2011, Nevadans rank sixth most pessimistic about economic conditions in their state and with good reason. The real estate and financial collapse that began in 2007 hit the state particularly hard and Nevada has been among the slowest to recover. By mid-2011, it remained the last state to escape the recession.
The sluggish economic recovery will soon face another challenge. A changing climate will impact the state’s economic engines, particularly the tourist industry, through disruptions in water supply and increases in temperatures. Without swift and bold action to mitigate climate change, Nevada will grow more and more vulnerable to potentially severe economic impacts.
 
Currently, southern Nevada faces an increasingly dire scarcity of water supplies that render past trends of use unsustainable. Local groundwater resources were long ago depleted and the water use in 2010, 520,000 acre feet per year, in the supply area of the Southern Nevada Water Authority (SNWA) greatly exceeded the entire state’s guaranteed Colorado River allocation of 300,000. The SNWA projects that, despite current strong conservation measures, demand in its domain will rise by 30 percent to 739,000 acre feet per year in 2035 and to 860,000 in 2060.
The consequences of the water shortage are significant. The SNWA has already announced that it will no longer automatically commit water to serve proposed future real estate developments. It also considered highly costly and controversial measures to tap additional supplies, including a) a desalinization plant in Mexico, b) a pipeline to divert water from as far away as the Mississippi and c) a groundwater development project drawing 200,000 acre feet per year from upstate Nevada, enough to supply an additional 100,000 households. This option would have a capital cost exceeding $15 billion and devastating environmental impacts on a large area within the state.
Such projects would produce additional water supplies only at drastically higher costs, not to mention doubts and uncertainty regarding feasibility. The groundwater development project requires permits from many state and federal agencies and is already being challenged in the courts because of its potential impacts on existing groundwater and surface water rights and on biological resources under federal stewardship. The draft environmental impact statement released by the Bureau of Land Management in June 2011 found that the SNWA’s proposed pumping would draw down the water table over a large area. The impacts on springs, streams, riparian areas, and associated plant and animal communities, including protected species, would be extensive and severe. There would be land subsidence in some areas and the loss of vegetation would promote dust storms.These environmental effects would persist and increase throughout the 21st century. This proposed diversion pits the growing urban area of Las Vegas against the traditional agricultural, ranching and natural areas in the rest of the state.
Moreover, the BLM’s draft Environment Impact Statement analyzing the right of way for this groundwater extraction project only nominally takes climate change into account during the 50 year development period of the proposed project. Climate change will increase the impacts of the project and may make proposed extraction rates infeasible. A parallel study by the Bureau of Reclamation, also released in June 2011, projects that in the Lower Colorado River Basin there will be significant increases in temperature and decreases in precipitation, soil moisture and evapotranspiration.
The region will continue to suffer significant drying. Runoff from the mountains in the north is expected to be more concentrated in the winter and early spring because of earlier loss of snowpack with adverse implications for infiltration and groundwater recharge. Half the global climate models considered by the Bureau of Reclamation predict lower overall precipitation in the River Basin as a whole. The uncertainty of precipitation and water supply make this option risky. The SNWA proposes to deal with the risks through “adaptive management,” a handy euphemism meaning that they plan to build the multi-billion dollar infrastructure and begin to pump water and then see what happens.
Compounding River Basin precipitation concerns, flows through the Colorado River system are projected to diminish because of climate change. According to the Bureau of Reclamation Study, mean annual flows at Lees Ferry for the 50-year period of the Study (2011-2060) are projected to be approximately 13.6 million acre feet. This represents a reduction in stream flow of approximately seven percent compared to the period 1950-1999 (14.6 million acre feet), or approximately nine percent when compared to the long-term period 1906-2007 (15.0 million acre feet).
There are similar results for neighboring rivers and streams. At each of these locations, flows are projected to decrease. These reductions would make Nevada’s allocation of 300,000 acre feet per year and any water rights it acquires in Arizona and Utah less secure and would also exacerbate tensions among parties to the Colorado River Compact, which was predicated on long-term stream flows exceeding 15 million acre feet per year.
These shortfalls also increase the risk of drought. The prolonged severe drought of the past decade nearly necessitated cuts in water released from the huge reservoirs at Lake Mead and Lake Powell, and precipitated the water authorities’ decision to commit approximately $800 million to construct a third intake at a lower level into Lake Mead. According to some experts, continuing climate change would ensure high probability of a drought in this century that will be more severe and prolonged than any in the historical record. One study estimated that with continued growth in water demand and climate change’s effects on runoff into the Colorado River system, there would be a 10 percent chance that live storage in Lake Mead would be exhausted by 2013 and a 50 percent chance in 2021.
A related study of climate change risks by researchers at the Sandia National Laboratory found a very high probability of water supply shortfalls in coming decades. Even without considering the direct implications for continued population growth, Sandia scientists concluded that Nevada was one of the states most at risk for economic and employment losses. Their study found significant economic damages to water-intensive sectors -- agriculture, mining, power generation and utilities -- from higher water costs. This finding came despite an assumption that their future water acquisition costs would be much lower than those that the SNWA must already pay and ignored any possibility of actual supply shortfalls. Such shortfalls might be obstacles, for example, to the three new coal-fired power plants now being planned in eastern Nevada. This study reinforces the conclusion that Nevada is a state at great risk from climate change.
Much of Nevada’s tourist income comes from attractions that will be vulnerable to climate impacts. For instance, Las Vegas’s 45 golf courses, which are used by one-third of all visitors, could see a sharp decline in golfers due to rising temperatures and decreased water supplies. Golfing in Nevada generates more than a billion dollars in annual revenues and employs more than 4,000 people. Fewer rounds of golf could be played due to the unpleasantness of the heat and turf that has browned. The decline in quality of experience could lead to decreased membership and golf course real estate developments will be affected. For example, the massive new Coyote Springs golf and real estate development project that encompasses several golf courses and artificial lakes and hundreds of residences would have to draw 80,000 acre feet per year from groundwater underlying rural Nevada using the same pipeline that the SNWA is seeking to construct. Current pumping within the Springs valley is already controversial because of its impact on threatened freshwater fish.
Other tourist attractions are also climate- sensitive. Lower water levels in Lake Mead significantly reduced recreational visitors, especially boaters, as marinas and docks were left high and dry. Drought and heat waves also depress visits to the national parks and recreation areas. Controlling for other influences, drought reduced visits New Mexico’s Bandelier National Monument by seven percent. Higher temperatures will also depress trout populations and increase forest mortality from bark beetles and fires.
The health impacts of climate change are particularly acute in Nevada. The Las Vegas region was ruled to be in compliance with the 1997 national ozone air quality standard only starting from March 2011. Higher summer temperatures, which promote ozone formation, are likely to push the region back into non-compliance, especially if considerably tighter ozone standards are implemented. In order to be in compliance with any proposed new standard, the state will have to impose further restrictions on power plants and other fossil fuel burners as well as on vehicular traffic. Nevada also has a problem with emissions of particulates that reduce visibility in national parks and other protected areas in the region. Small particles from wildfires and desert dust will exacerbate the problem as the region dries out.
The impacts of climate change on public health will lead illnesses and disease to thrive, physical well-being to plummet, and health care costs to soar. The state will be poorer and sicker as climate change adversely affects human health. Among the negative health impacts, asthma attacks and allergies will be more severe due to higher levels of air pollution, including ozone, particulates from dust and wildfires, and higher pollen counts that start earlier in the spring. Since about 20 percent of Nevada’s population now is without health insurance, many of those affected will seek medical care in hospital emergency rooms.
Higher ozone and particulate levels are reliably linked to increased mortality and morbidity. Among the elderly, stroke and heart attack increase with rising heat. People with chronic heart or lung diseases are twice as likely to suffer heat stroke during a heat wave. Deaths from cardiovascular disease or stroke account for almost a third of Nevada’s total mortality. In the past decade, a six percent increase in heat-related mortality was observed for every one degree F rise in the heat index and mortality also rose with the duration of the heat wave. Unless climate change is brought under control, Nevada’s health care costs will rise more rapidly and its citizens will suffer.
A strong national climate policy that rapidly stabilizes atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations will enable Nevada to avoid the worst of these impacts. It will also allow Nevada to benefit significantly from its abundant endowment of geothermal, solar and wind resources. At present, 85 percent of the state’s electricity is generated from coal or gas. There is a Renewable Portfolio Standard in place that mandates a 25 percent share for renewables by 2025, including six percent from solar power, but the potential for renewable electricity generation goes far beyond this minimum requirement. Already there is installed capacity of about 500 MW of geothermal power and the potential for further expansion is at least five times that amount in geothermal resources spread across 60 percent of the land area. Moreover, among all the states, Nevada is second only to neighboring Arizona in solar potential and there are also abundant wind resources. Nevada could both meet its future needs with renewable energy and export clean power to neighboring California.
Regional and national cap-and-trade policies that establish a “price on carbon” and carve out a growing space in electricity markets for renewable power would make Nevada’s existing installations more profitable and secure and would raise the return on future investments in geothermal, solar and wind projects. Such policies would neutralize the cost advantage that fossil fuels now enjoy because of their significantly lower negative environmental impacts. The resulting surge in clean energy would be a strong boost to Nevada’s rural economies.

"Arizona’s citizens and its economy are among America’s most vulnerable to the growing adverse impacts of climate change. Climate change will have significant impacts on water resources and economic opportunities. Recent polling shows that the majority of voters in Arizona believe that state and federal governments should do more to address these impacts.1 To reduce the threats and realize the opportunities posed by climate change, Arizona’s leaders must support regional, national and international programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and accelerate a transition to clean energy.
Climate change is already affecting Arizona’s environment. Temperatures have risen by almost two degrees F in the past several decades, more rapidly than any other state in the lower 48 states, and are projected to continue increasing sharply by another three to five degrees F by 2050.2 Rapid urbanization is exacerbating this trend by extending the urban heat island effect over larger areas and longer seasons, raising night-time temperatures by as much as 10 degrees compared to adjoining natural areas.3 Heat waves of extraordinarily high summertime temperatures for extended periods of time are becoming more common.4 The number of days with low night- time temperatures above 90 degrees has increased sharply in successive decades.5
Air and water quality will suffer. Low river flows and higher water temperatures will raise water pollution concentrations. Ozone and smog concentrations will rise with higher air temperatures and growing energy use. Smoke from fires and dust from dry arid landscapes will raise particulate concentrations.
Climate change is reducing precipitation, especially in the spring and early summer months, and these declines are projected to continue.6 Runoff in the Colorado and other river systems that Arizona’s water supply depend on for direct use and for groundwater recharge will decline by 20-40 percent by mid-century, exacerbating water supply shortages that are already evident. The Colorado River system is already overstretched and unable to meet future demand.7 Reduced precipitation, increasing heat and evapotranspiration from soils and plants are making serious droughts a more frequent occurrence.8
In the past decade Arizona has been suffering from the worst drought in a century. Wildfires have increased in frequency and severity and will continue to do so as long as there are trees and other vegetation left to burn. Natural ecosystems, including Arizona’s northern forests and its biodiversity hotspot (the Madrean Pine-Oak Woodlands) in the south, will be adversely affected by heat, drought, fire and proliferation of insect pests.
Adaptation to future water stresses in Arizona will be difficult and costly. Both groundwater and surface water resources are already over-allocated across much of the state. Increased population and economic growth will face water supplies that are already inadequate and diminishing with climate change, necessitating reallocations – largely out of agriculture – and different patterns of use. Yet, such changes are not determined by price and market signals. Water use in Arizona and throughout the Southwest is governed largely by administrative and judicial allocations involving private parties, local institutions, state, inter-state and federal authorities. Climate change will not only unsettle existing allocations, perhaps even the vital Colorado River Compact, but also introduce uncertainty into future allocation decisions, involving courts and government agencies in difficult conflicts.9
Urban water demand rises with increasing temperatures, as most water is used for outdoor watering. To meet the demand, water agencies will most likely be forced to consider costlier options as desalinization, waste water recycling and new diversions and storage projects to offset increasing shortages. Most of the supply enhancement projects under consideration, except conservation, are energy-intensive, but current energy supply options are themselves highly water-intensive, creating an escalating cost feedback loop.10 Inevitably, climate change will sharply raise the cost of meeting future water demand.
Climate change will have severe negative impacts on Arizona’s economic drivers, as well as resulting in more costs for the state. A recent study by researchers at the Sandia National Laboratory considered impacts of precipitation declines on the half-dozen industries with the greatest water consumption (e.g., agriculture, utilities, mining, chemical manufacturing), sectors that make relatively small contributions to the state’s GDP.11 The study found that economic damages would be spread widely throughout the rest of the state’s economy because of higher input costs, lower consumer incomes and spending, population changes and changes in the state’s inter-regional competitiveness. Retail trade, food manufacturing and construction would be among the sectors most severely affected by these secondary effects but no sector would be unscathed. This study found Arizona to be among the nation’s most vulnerable states, even though the full range of possible future heat, drought, and precipitation impacts was not considered, and optimistic assumptions about adaptation to future water shortages were included.
For some of the most vulnerable sectors of Arizona’s economy, the direct damages from climate change are already being felt. Agriculture and ranching are facing increasing heat, drought, water shortages and pest damages that combine to reduce yields and productivity. In bad years, feed shortages force many ranchers to sell off herds at distressed prices, taking heavy losses.12 Arizona farmers are heavily dependent on irrigation and even those with senior water rights are likely to face increasing shortages. More marginalized farmers, including Latinos and Native Americans, are more vulnerable because their access to crop insurance, credit, federal disaster relief and other institutional support is weaker.13
Although farming and ranching constitute only about two percent of the state GDP,14 their importance to rural economies and associated industries is considerably larger, as is their political weight. Many Arizonan farmers and ranchers who hold senior water rights strongly resist water transfers to non-agricultural uses, even though urban and industrial water values are markedly higher than in most agricultural uses. There will be increasing pressure to transfer water out of agriculture toward industries that can afford to pay more for it15 but there are legal, political and institutional impediments to these reallocations. Adaptation to supply constraints is unlikely to be smooth or economically efficient.16
Arizona’s most dynamic and growth-generating sectors are also surprisingly vulnerable to climate change. Arizona was once a leader in high-tech manufacturing, which generated significant sales outside the state and many high-paying jobs within it. In 2005, the high-tech sector contributed five percent of state GDP, four percent of employment and seven percent of earnings. If indirect effects are included, high- tech’s contribution rises to 11, 10 and 13 percent, respectively. Yet, Arizona’s lead in these industries has been eroding to the extent that Arizona is now not significantly above the average of all the states.17 Most high-tech industries are “footloose”: their location is not tied to local markets or to raw material supplies. High-tech firms must be able to attract and retain highly trained and educated executives, engineers and scientists, who typically have nation-wide choices of employment. For this reason, “quality of life” considerations enter strongly into locational decisions.18
Salient among these considerations are an attractive climate and scenery, outdoor recreation resources, and cultural and educational opportunities. Prolonged summer heat in excess of 100 degrees and rising at times to 110 and 120 degrees is a deterrent rather than an attraction. For example, there is a marked hot-season drop-off of business travel to Arizona, measured by business segment hotel rooms sold during the summer months.19 Climate change is likely to discourage movement into the state by footloose high-tech industries, research centers and corporate headquarters that are sensitive to quality of life issues. Though there has been a significant movement of economic activity toward the Sunbelt states in recent decades, growth of population and employment within the Sunbelt has been negatively associated with temperature, favoring metropolitan statistical areas with more moderate climates.20
A substantial segment of Arizona’s economy is the extremely climate-sensitive travel and tourism industry. Almost 37 million visitors in 2010 spent nearly $18 billion on a wide variety of goods and services, generating more than 150,000 jobs, nearly $5 billion in direct earnings, and $3.5 billion in state and local taxes.21 Eighty percent of this business is derived from out-of-state visitors, making tourism Arizona’s leading export industry. Tourism also generated $297 million in construction investment, more than 10 percent of all non-residential construction in Arizona in 2010. This investment supported 5,300 construction jobs with earnings of $280 million in a weak economy. Including the earnings and employment of businesses supplying the tourism sector and the spending by employees in those businesses, the direct plus indirect contribution of tourism to the Arizona economy rises considerably, to 283,000 jobs with $9.7 billion in annual earnings.22
Recent experience confirms that visitation is highly sensitive to climate and its effects. Controlling for other influences, drought reduces visits to some national parks by seven percent.23 During the 1999-2003 period, when lake levels fell 2.1 percent at Mead and 5.4 percent at Powell, those changes reduced visits to Glen Canyon by half a million visitors and reduced spending by $32 million. At Lake Powell, there were almost a million fewer visitors and $28 million less in tourist spending.Tourism statistics show that for every one percent drop in the reservoir level, visits to Lake Powell fall by five percent.24 Reduced river flows and deterioration of riparian habitats undermines fishing, rafting, boating and other water-based activities. Forest fires are also a deterrent.25
According to the U.S. Forest Service, there are 182 communities bordering federal lands in Arizona and New Mexico that are at risk of forest fires.26 Many of these towns host second home developments, which make up more than six percent of all residences in Arizona.27 Arizona’s ski facilities are also vulnerable. Rising winter temperatures, less precipitation falling as snow, and increasing water scarcity will shorten the ski season, perhaps drastically, especially at the Arizona SnowBowl where snowmaking possibilities are limited. The lack of snow will hurt not only the ski operations but also the value of second homes and other real estate developments around the ski areas.
Skiing, fishing and other outdoor recreational activities will suffer from climate change. Forty percent of Arizonans surveyed engage in sport and fitness exercises and 25 percent enjoy outdoor recreation.28 More than two-thirds of the golfers on the state’s 421 courses are residents, many of them retirees who have relocated to Arizona. Golfing makes an important economic contribution, estimated in 2004 at $3.4 billion, counting direct, indirect and induced golf-related spending. The higher prices commanded by houses in golfing developments amount to a premium of over $2 billion.29 However, water scarcity has already forced golf courses to reduce consumptive water use significantly, in part by restricting the area of turf. Climate change will make further restrictions inevitable. The lack of assured sustainable water supplies may even constrain future residential real estate and golf course resort developments. A more threatening effect is that golfing becomes a less appealing sport when temperatures rise to uncomfortably hot levels. Fewer rounds of golf are played and green fees fall in the hot spring and summer months. As the duration and intensity of the hot season increases, golf clubs revenues will suffer. The demand for membership will fall, hurting finances and making it difficult for older members to sell without taking losses.
The broader impact of climate change will be a decline in Arizona’s attractiveness as a retirement destination, which has always been based largely on its warm and dry climate. Retirees moving to Arizona make important economic contributions. In 2000, more than 20 percent of the population had been living in another state five years earlier. More than half the population was born in another state. Since retirees’ incomes are not based on employment earnings, they bring a stable source of spending from outside the states. In 2000, 27 percent of the population was receiving social security benefits.30 In Maricopa and Pima counties, subject to the widening heat island over urban and suburban population centers, life throughout much of the year will become increasingly uncomfortable and even unhealthy for seniors venturing outdoors.
Electricity generating costs will also increase for several reasons. Low-cost hydroelectric production will fall with the reduced runoff from the Colorado River. Cooling water required for coal, gas, nuclear, and solar thermal generating plants will become scarcer and more costly. Non-conventional oil and gas production is extremely water-intensive and will face limits on availability. Because hotter weather boosts the photochemical reactions that create atmospheric smog and because urban areas are already out of compliance with existing national ozone standards, which may be tightened substantially, coal-fired power plants will have to install expensive controls on nitrogen oxide emissions, an ozone precursor in order to keep operating.
Climate change will also raise the summer peak in electricity demand and extend it through a longer air conditioning season, when it accounts for 70 percent of household electricity consumption. Meeting summer peak demand is nearly twice as costly as meeting off-peak requirements and considerably more costly than meeting the lower cool season peak demand. Under heat and drought conditions, peak summer generating costs can rise to 30-50 cents per kwh. Ironically, the main objection to policies limiting greenhouse gas emissions is that they will raise energy costs but in Arizona energy costs will also increase if such policies are not enacted and climate change goes unchecked.
Climate change will place additional stresses on Arizona’s health care system, which is already constrained by rising costs.31 Nearly one in five Arizonans are dependent on Arizona’s Medicaid equivalent (AHCCCS) and an additional 19 percent have no health insurance at all.32 Asthma attacks and allergies will be exacerbated by higher air pollution levels, including ozone, particulates from dust and wildfires, and higher pollen counts that start earlier in the spring. Higher ozone and particulate levels are reliably linked to increased mortality and morbidity. Among the elderly, stroke and heart attack increase with rising heat.33 People with chronic heart or lung diseases are twice as likely to suffer heat stroke during a heat wave. Heart disease accounted for 24 percent of deaths in Arizona in 2005, while stroke caused five percent of deaths.34
In the past decade, a six percent increase in heat-related mortality was observed for each one degree F rise in the heat index and mortality also rose with the duration of the heat wave.35 Between 1999 and 2009, the percentage of annual deaths occurring during the hot April to September months rose from 45 to 49 percent and heat-related dispatches of medical emergency teams climb sharply in the summer months, averaging more than nine a day in Phoenix alone.36 Low-income households are much more vulnerable to these health effects because the high cost of electricity prevents them from using air conditioning more consistently.37 Unless climate change is brought under control, Arizona’s health costs will continue to rise rapidly and the state’s citizens will suffer.
Given the impact that climate change will have on Arizona’s economy and citizens, the state’s leaders should support regional, national and international efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions along with measures specific to Arizona itself. Arizona is positioned to benefit substantially from a transition to clean renewable energy. Its solar potential is the finest in the country. Arizona could become a world leader in solar technology, generating tens of thousands of high-paying jobs and billions of dollars in export earnings beyond the state’s borders. The National Renewable Energy Lab has estimated that Arizona has the potential for 2.5 gigawatts of concentrating solar electricity, able to generate 5.8 gigawatt hours of electricity, more than in any other state in the nation.38 Little of this potential has yet been realized.
There are already national, state and utility level incentives in place to make use of this enormous potential, including Arizona’s Renewable Portfolio Standard, which mandates a 15 percent share of renewable generation by 2025.39 A recent study has produced a roadmap by which the state can stimulate solar investment and accelerate the pace of installation and simultaneously develop the supporting manufacturing and research capabilities.40 A key stimulus to rapid development would be a regional or national policy that sets a price on carbon dioxide emissions through either an emission fee or a cap-and-trade regime applied to the electric utility sector. Such a policy would equalize the cost structure so that solar power could compete economically in intra-state and regional markets. With the cost disadvantage neutralized, solar’s other advantages of stable operating costs and low pollution would lead to rapid deployment. It is in Arizona’s economic interest to support national and regional policies of this kind.",research
"Climate change poses a tremendous threat to Florida. Sea level rise, more intense precipitation, and stronger hurricanes increase the risk of natural disaster and imperil the state’s economy and its citizens’ safety. Compounding these dangers, increasing coastal population and development will put more people and property at danger. In years to come, those risks will lead to devastating damage if they are not mitigated. Florida has strong interests in limiting the extent of climate change and the state’s leaders should support efforts to enact strong national and international climate policies.
Florida’s climate is complex. It is influenced by the ENSO (El Nino-Southern Oscillation), the Atlantic Multi-Decadal Oscillation and other forces that sometimes act in concert, sometimes in opposition. This variability makes it difficult to isolate statistically the ongoing effects of climate change in the weather record and will continue to do so for decades to come. The consequence, however, is not to reduce or to defer the increasing threats but only to make them more difficult to understand, thus complicating efforts to build support for an adequate response. But, as this report shows, failure to act will be disastrous. A study by the Sandia National Laboratory found that Florida is one of the states most vulnerable to devastating climate impacts.
The effects of climate change on hurricane frequencies and intensities have been the subject of much scientific investigation and inquiry. As they generate power from warm, moist air over warm ocean waters, hurricanes are becoming more intense as climate change continues to increase ocean temperatures. The current scientific understanding is that sustained warming will result in the more intense hurricanes becoming more frequent in Florida’s latitudes and the less intense hurricanes growing less frequent.
With climate change driven by increasing emissions, the frequency of the most intense Category 4 and 5 storms would be expected to increase by 80 percent by 2080, or by roughly one percent per year. Over the same period the frequency of the less intense Category 1-3 hurricanes will diminish by 38 percent. The implication is that hurricane risks are increasing dramatically because historically, Category 4 and 5 hurricanes have caused 86 and 48 percent of recorded hurricane damages, even though they represented only 24 and 6 percent of hurricane landfalls in the United States respectively. A study by Yale Economics Professor William Nordhaus, based on previous hurricanes that have struck the United States, found that higher winds cause more devastation, persist longer at damaging levels and generally affect a wider area.
While hurricane risks are intensifying, Florida’s economy is changing in ways that put more people and property in harm’s way. The state’s population is growing and commercial and real estate development are again increasing in the coastal zone, despite the collapse of the real estate bubble. This trend is expected to continue. In fact, the potential loss from any given storm is expected to double in each decade. This prediction is consistent with Florida’s history over the period 1995-2010, a period spanning the real estate bubble, when the total loss exposure of insured property increased from $774 billion to $2.2 trillion, an annual increase of 7.5 percent per year.
Residential properties in the exposed areas are particularly vulnerable. Seventy-eight percent of houses, excluding mobile homes, were built before 1944 and 88 percent do not meet current building codes. For example, only six percent have hurricane shutters, or equivalent protection, and 54 percent connect roof to walls only by nails, toe-nailing, adhesives, friction or gravity. People are also vulnerable. Only one-third of vulnerable households evacuated in the face of Hurricane Andrew, despite evacuation warnings. In future category 4 and 5 storms, more than a million households might have to be evacuated from exposed areas in South Florida, a process that could take 24 to 48 hours.
The Florida Office of Insurance Regulation, which oversees the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund and private insurers, estimates that in 2010 the insured losses of a storm with a 50-year return period would be approximately $40 billion. Total economic damages are estimated by multiplying insured losses by two. However, this rule-of-thumb is a gross underestimate. Not all storm hazards are covered by conventional property insurance – flood damages, for instance. Also excluded are the potential deaths and injuries from a severe hurricane. The losses to businesses that are closed because facilities or infrastructure are damaged or potential customers are displaced are not accounted for.
The loss from closed businesses is particularly important in Florida because tourism is one of the state’s most important industries. 85.9 million tourists visited Florida in 2011 almost all from out-of-state. In 2010, direct tourist spending exceeded $62.7 billion per year and generated $3.8 billion of state sales tax revenue, not including the significant impacts of indirect expenditures resultant from tourism. Over one million people are directly employed in the tourism industry and that number increases significantly when indirect employment is taken into account, largely in lodging, restaurants, and retail stores. Natural disasters have immediate and long-lasting effects on tourism. After Florida was struck by several hurricanes in 2004, causing disruptions and evacuations, surveys of potential tourists found that 20 percent would not return next year. Severe hurricanes with higher frequencies could potentially cripple the tourism industry, with major impacts on associated industries that make up more than a third of Florida’s economy.
When these projections of higher sea levels, more frequent intense hurricanes, and increased property values at risk are brought together in an integrated analysis, using numbers that represent the best current estimates of Florida’s scientists, the results are ominous. The following table shows the changing return periods of Category 1 through 5 hurricanes from 2000 through 2050 striking the Miami-Dade region. Though the probabilities of moderate hurricanes decline, the probabilities of major hurricane strikes increase by 50 percent over the period. By 2050 there would be about a one in ten chance that a Category 4 or Category 5 hurricane would strike the Miami-Dade area in any year. Other areas along Florida’s coast face similar changes in risks. Since the higher intensity storms create by far the greater damage, overall risks from hurricanes increases significantly.
In order to construct an overall risk analysis, these return periods, expressed as probabilities, were combined with the damage function estimated by Nordhaus and an estimate by MIT professor Kerry Emanuel that a hurricane with 130 miles per hour winds striking Miami in 2000 would result in damages of $87 billion. Damage estimates also factored in the effects of rising sea levels and the increase in coastal population and value at risk.
Within the table below, expected losses are the damages that would be suffered from a storm of each intensity, multiplied by the probability of such a storm occurring, and then added up for all possible storms. Expected losses represent the actuarially fair value of hurricane damages to the region—the amount that insurers would have to collect in premiums (without overhead) to break even over time. Expected losses rise dramatically, more than doubling in each decade because of the combined effects of climate change on hurricane intensities and sea level, along with the increase in value at risk. Private insurers would have to raise rates dramatically or withdraw from the market and the state’s Citizen’s Property Insurance Corporation will need much greater taxpayer support. At this time, unfortunately, the Florida Hurricane Public Loss Projection Model, developed for the Office of Insurance Regulation, does not yet incorporate the effects of climate change on hurricane frequencies because of the problems of separating these effects from shorter—term variability.
Comparable analyses would likely reach similar conclusions for urban areas all around Florida’s coastline, from Pensacola in the Gulf to Jacksonville in the Northeast. The implication of Florida’s own best estimates, when put together, is that climate change is sharply increasing the risks to its economy and citizens and substantially increasing the likelihood of catastrophic damage.
One of the clearest impacts of climate change is the documented rise in sea levels, which has been taking place along Florida’s coasts at more than two centimeters per decade. Higher atmospheric temperatures heat the oceans and water expands as it warms. Sea levels rise further as melt waters from glaciers and continental ice sheets pour into the oceans at high latitudes. This process is expected to accelerate. Sea levels are projected to be three to seven inches higher by 2030 (over 2010), nine to 24 inches higher by 2060, and 39 inches higher by 2100, and the rise will continue long thereafter.
Even apart from larger storm surges, these sea level rises will have major impacts on coastal Florida, where 80 percent of the state’s population lives. Because so much of the shoreline is flat and low-lying, the impacts of even small rises extend far inland. Taking tidal variations into account, a one-foot rise can move the shoreline inward by more than a thousand feet. Most of this inundation will affect undeveloped land, especially in South Florida, replacing upland plant communities with mangroves and marshes and replacing those with tidal flats and open water. Commercial and recreational fisheries dependent on those coastal ecosystems and estuaries for spawning will be damaged along with many bird and animal populations.
Faster onshore winds from more intense hurricanes will push more water inland, generally creating higher storm surges. Sea level rise and the consequent landward movement of the shoreline will increase the damages from storm surges that occur when violent storms approach land. Florida is extraordinarily vulnerable to storm surges because of its location, its topography and the concentration of population and development along the coast. A recent FEMA study estimated that within the impact area of the historical hundred-year coastal storm surge, there were more than 3.9 million people in the year 2000, almost 25 percent of the state’s population. Florida has considerably more people at hazard than any other state and what had been known as the hundred-year flood is becoming more frequent. Nearly the entire coastline is at risk.
As storm surges increase and move inland, damage risks will escalate. For instance, 2005’s Hurricane Wilma resulted in a seven-foot high surge in Dade County and, according to a FEMA study, now has a 76-year return period. When sea levels have risen one foot, the return period for the same seven-foot storm surge would be only 21 years. When the sea has risen 2.13 ft, the return period for the same seven-foot storm surge would be five years. A storm surge similar to Hurricane Wilma will happen with about 15 times the frequency experienced in the past, just because of sea level rise. Moreover, the storm surge associated with Wilma, increased by a two foot sea level rise, would have caused at least 30 percent greater damages in Dade County than it actually did.
NOAA’s National Hurricane Center has carried out extensive modeling for specific regions to determine the probable effects of hurricanes on the height of storm surges. Based on this model’s results, the Florida Division of Emergency Management has created an atlas of potential storm surges around Florida’s coastlines. The amount of land affected by surges would increase substantially for more intense hurricanes, threatening extensive areas of urban development. The following table, based on NOAA’s SLOSH model, illustrates the impact of hurricane intensity on the height of maximum storm surge. Rising sea levels and more frequent intense hurricanes combine to raise the risks of storm surges and flooding dramatically.
For a one-foot increase in sea level, property losses will amount to many billions of dollars, more than $4 billion in Southeast Florida alone. A study focused just on the Florida Keys found that a two-foot rise would inundate 70 percent of the land area, flood out 17 percent of the population and 12 percent of the property value. This study, based on detailed topographic analysis, also found that the damages rise disproportionately as topographical barriers are toppled over.
Sea level rise will also greatly exacerbate existing problems of both water supply and drainage. South Florida’s complex public water management system is already under pressure from rising demand and limited capacity. Climate change is expected to reduce rainfall in southern Florida, increasing vulnerability to droughts like those of 2006-2010. Cities and towns in the region draw water from underground freshwater aquifers. Saltwater intrusion into these aquifers because of sea level rise and excessive pumping already threatens the public water supply in the densely populated region from the Florida Keys to Palm Beach.
Supplies in Florida’s two most populous counties — Miami-Dade and Broward— will be diminished further as the salt water boundary pushes inward from the Atlantic and infiltrates the Biscayne aquifer.Those areas may be forced to restrict withdrawals for irrigation and replace previous supplies by building expensive desalinization plants. Simultaneously, sea level rise will reduce the capacity of storm water drainage systems that carry excess water to the sea during periods of potential flooding by as much as two-thirds by 2040, increasing the risks of flooding from more intense rainfall events.
The long-term economic impacts of climate change will be most severe on Florida’s attractiveness as a destination for retirees and seasonal migrants. Second homes for those who winter in Florida constitute roughly eight percent of the state’s housing stock. For decades Florida has also been the favorite destination for retirees who move out of their home states, but that lead is shrinking: Florida was the destination for 26 percent of inter-state retirees in 1980 but only 16 percent in 2008. Still, retirees bring at least $2.2 billion in outside annual income to the state from pensions, social security and other retirement income.
A favorable climate, attractive waterfronts, and affordable housing have been the main draws, but increasing storm surges and hurricanes and rising insurance costs would change all that. Florida’s population is aging: the largest population increase in the coming decade will be people over 65. They are risk-averse. Economic studies estimate that such households would be willing to pay as much as nine percent of their income to reduce the likelihood of a natural disaster with a 50-year return period (currently a Category 5 hurricane) by half. This indicates how unwilling those relocating will be to live in locations where such catastrophic risks are not decreasing but are increasing rapidly.
At the greatest risk of damage from climate change is the Everglades watershed, which would be extensively inundated by saltwater in its southern reaches by mid-century. The economic losses from tourism alone would amount to nearly a billion dollars in direct expenditures (at 2007 levels) and an equal amount in indirect expenditures. Also lost would be some of the important ecosystem services that the Everglades now provides, such as recharge of freshwater aquifers, improvement of water quality through filtration and sediment deposition, flood protection, and habitat for many species of plants and animals.
Florida currently spends $200 million per year in public funds in beach protection and restoration, recognizing that its beaches are an invaluable tourism and recreational asset. Yet, Florida’s beaches are in danger as beach erosion and the breaching of barrier islands along Florida’s coasts accelerate due to rising sea levels and storm surges. Eroding beaches destroy thousands of homes in the United States every year and reduce the value of surviving beachfront property. In 2002 more than half the beaches in Florida were eroded and, of these, three-quarters were critically eroded and less than half of those were being managed.
A 2005 assessment found that beaches drew nearly 40 percent of tourists to Florida, more than 90 percent of those coming from out-of-state. Direct spending by beach tourists contributed 3.9 percent of Florida’s GDP and created half a million jobs. Indirect expenditures doubled those amounts.
Climate change will have other significant impacts on Florida’s economy. Rising ocean temperatures and acidification will harm the marine environment as the seas absorb heat and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Warmer water combined with greater fertilization by mineral-laden dust blown across the Atlantic, will exacerbate the “red tide” and other algal blooms that close beaches and kill marine life by the millions. Vibrio- related illnesses from eating contaminated shellfish, which have doubled in incidence in the last decade, will continue to increase.
Acidification and higher water temperatures will kill off Florida’s corals, a major tourist attraction in the Keys and important fish habitat. Acidification also affects plankton and other organisms at the base of the fisheries food chain as well as such important marine resources as shrimp, lobster and other crustaceans. Tourism and recreational fishing, both important to Florida’s economy, will be harmed. Non-residents made 20 million fishing trips in Florida’s waters in 2011, the second highest total in the country.
Florida’s own scientific estimates indicate that the state’s economy and people face rapidly rising risks of catastrophic damages. Florida’s leaders, whether in politics and government or in the private sector, have compelling reasons to support strong, immediate policies at the state, national and international level to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to mitigate the growing risks of global warming. Florida’s people, who ultimately bear those risks and will suffer the damages, should compel their leaders to do so.

"Virginia’s climatic changes have been thoroughly documented over recent decades. The overwhelming weight of scientific evidence predicts that climate change will continue and may accelerate unless strong action is taken to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. Climate change threatens serious harm to Virginia’s economy, its people and its treasured natural resources. Virginia’s political leaders should promote vigorous state, national and international policies to halt global warming. Virginia’s current leadership, both in government and in the private sector, should take up this mission.
Although Virginia has experienced a relatively moderate rate of climate change compared to many other parts of the country over the past century as a whole, the speed and scale of climatic changes has gained momentum and has been accelerating throughout the last 50 years. Warming has occurred across the state, mostly during the winter months, when average temperatures rose about one degree C. Precipitation patterns also changed: summer rainfall declined on average by 0.50mm/day but in the fall months, precipitation increased by about the same amount. Correspondingly, there were more days of intense precipitation and precipitation became more variable, with greater frequency of both wet and dry periods, including the pronounced drought of 2010.
All regional climate models project rising temperatures over coming decades. Annual average temperatures are expected to rise by three to four degrees centigrade over this century and possibly much more if emission levels continue to grow rapidly, with corresponding increases in both maximum and minimum temperatures. Overall precipitation is expected to increase by about ten percent and some models forecast that most of the increase will occur during the summer. The number of hot and humid days and the corresponding “misery index” will climb substantially. There are likely to be more heat waves like the one that Virginia suffered in the summer of 2011. Virginia’s seasons will change: spring will come earlier, summer will last longer into the fall and winters will be milder.

"The policy that allows eligible voters to register and vote on the same day. 
Same-Day Registration (SDR) allows eligible voters to register to vote and cast their ballots on the same day. Depending on the state, this one-stop process for registering and voting may be offered on Election Day, during the early voting period, or both. Eligible voters can also use Same-Day Registration to correct an outdated voter registration record and cast a ballot that will be counted. Pioneered by Maine, Minnesota, and Wisconsin in the early-to-mid-1970s, fifteen states (California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Wisconsin, and Wyoming) and the District of Columbia have now enacted the reform.

"Same-Day Registration (SDR) in Montana, which takes place during the state’s late registration period, has operated smoothly since 2006. SDR modernizes election systems by allowing eligible residents to both register to vote and then cast a ballot on the same day, which eliminates arbitrary registration deadlines and facilitates onsite fixes to registration issues. Since 1973, eleven additional states and the District of Columbia have enacted and successfully conducted SDR elections.1 A number of additional states have either passed SDR measures that are awaiting implementation, passed SDR pilot studies, and/or have introduced SDR legislation within the past calendar year.2 SDR states consistently lead the nation in voter turnout.3
In November 2014, voters in Montana will face a very important choice: to repeal or to continue SDR. In 2013, the State Legislature approved Senate Bill 405.4 This bill set into motion Legislative Referendum 126 (LR 126), a voter ballot initiative that aims to eliminate SDR. Under this measure, SDR opponents hope that voters elect to roll back the registration deadline to 5 p.m. on the Friday before Election Day.5
LR 126 acts against a tailwind of momentum in favor of pro-voter reforms across the country. A repeal of SDR in Montana will only hinder voters’ access to the ballot, inevitably creating cumbersome and unnecessary obstacles.
 
The cost effectiveness of SDR is apparent, both in recent SDR states as well as historically. Election officials in Iowa and North Carolina, which each adopted SDR in 2007, have reported little to no additional costs associated with SDR implementation and any additional expenses were usually offset by the decreased printing and processing of provisional ballots.6 Research shows a similar story in long-standing SDR states Maine, Minnesota and Wisconsin (which each first enacted SDR during the 1970s). Elections in these states are no more costly in comparison to non-SDR states.7
Conversely, the available research regarding potential costs for repealing SDR are quite exorbitant. Following the 2012 General Election, the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board (GAB) released a report regarding the impacts and costs of repealing SDR in their state.8 Given the increased costs of maintaining accurate voter rolls, remaining in compliance with regulations of the aforementioned NVRA and Help America Vote Act (HAVA), and accounting for the likely increase in provisional ballot processing and public education efforts that become necessary with any electoral change, the GAB assessed the resulting costs to range from between $13 million and $16 million.9
As it stands, simply placing LR 126 on the 2014 General Election ballot will cost each of Montana’s fifty-six counties $75,000.10 While total SDR repeal related expenditures may not reach a final sum that is as high as Wisconsin’s projections (due to respective differences in population and election system infrastructures), additional costs will certainly accrue as Montana works to educate voters in order to remain in compliance with existing federal mandates.
 
One fact about SDR is clear: when the reform is in place, voters quickly become accustomed to the enhancement. The ease of being able to register and vote concurrently, for young voters, voters of color, and new residents in particular is the reason for SDR’s success and popularity. Doing away with SDR will demand a significant public re-education effort, for which many voters—e.g., residents who have moved between Montana counties as well as those who have recently moved from other states—may not learn of the registration changes within enough time to comply. Poll workers and other election officials will also need to be re-educated in order to convey information accurately to voters. As a result, the likely consequence of eliminating SDR is voter hardship at the polls; this includes verification issues that lead to longer lines and wait times and increased provisional balloting (in the event that frustrated voters choose to persevere through the process altogether).
 
Montanans are by-and-large satisfied with the state’s electoral system in its current form. In recent polling, 70 percent of respondents—irrespective of political orientation—believe that SDR is necessary to protect voter participation, and thereby, the state’s democracy overall.11 To this effect they also believe that SDR protects the state's democracy overall, by a 66-to-31 percent margin.12 For these and other reasons, nearly threequarters of respondents believe that Montana’s SDR system works well. Among all respondents, 89 percent of Democrats, 69 percent of Independents and 66 percent of Republicans believe that Montana’s election system is fair, working well, and something to be proud of.13
 
LR 126 places an undue burden on Montana voters that will unravel an electoral tool that they clearly favor. If enacted, both the monetary and procedural costs of repealing SDR far outweigh any potential benefits, and are in fact more likely to exacerbate the problems that LR 126 is ostensibly designed to fix. Neither election administrators nor voters emerge as winners under any scenario that eliminates SDR from the menu of provoter options that are currently at Montanans’ disposal. Simply put, eliminating SDR as through LR 126 is a losing proposition for election administrators, voters, and democracy in Montana. ",research
"Why Protections for Schools, Hospitals and Courthouses Are Essential
Immigration enforcement is not appropriate in schools and policies are needed to shield students and their families from the threat of immigration enforcement in the school environment. This position is backed by well-established legal doctrine. In Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202 (1975), the Supreme Court held that the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects the rights undocumented immigrants equal access to public education.1 The Plyler doctrine is based on the long- standing rule that provisions of the Bill of Rights of the U.S. Constitution providing for equal protection and due process of law apply to all persons who happen to be in the territory of a state. It is also based on the principles and rules against discrimination in education set forth in Brown v. Board of Education.
The Alabama case also demonstrates the extremely detrimental impact of such policies on Latino children who were fearful for themselves and their parents, and caused Latino enrollment to drop. Under current conditions, such an impact is expected in any immigrant community if status information collected by schools can be used for federal immigration enforcement.3
Policies are needed to shield persons seeking health care from ICE. President Trump’s Executive Order on Interior Enforcement provides authority for ICE to deport all 11 million undocumented persons and even persons with legal status. His Executive Orders were followed by harshly-worded Department of Homeland Security memos effectively confirming the targeting of 11 million immigrants, and immediate implementation through terrifying ICE raids targeting hundreds of non-criminal immigrants, including in Maryland—and even deporting a woman from Texas who was about to go into emergency surgery to remove a brain tumor. 
Access to health care and in particular, hospitals, is needed for humanitarian reasons, for every person who needs it, and for the health of the communities they live in.
Hospitals and health clinics were considered “sensitive locations” where ICE would not conduct immigration enforcement except under highly exceptional circumstances, but the current administration does not seem to be honoring this long-standing policy. 
Very strong public safety reasons argue for policies prohibiting civil immigration enforcement in state and local courthouses. In particular, since January 20, ICE has been increasing their presence in courthouses, where vulnerable immigrant victims and witnesses, as well as persons charged with civil or criminal offenses have the right to a fair trial.
“Our courthouses serve as a vital forum for ensuring access to justice and protecting public safety. Courthouses should not be used as bait in the necessary enforcement of our country’s immigration laws... Our courts are the main point of contact for millions of the most vulnerable Californians in times of anxiety, stress, and crises in their lives. Crime victims, victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence, witnesses to crimes who are aiding law enforcement, limited-English speakers, unrepresented litigants, and children and families all come to our courts seeking justice and due process of law. As finders of fact, trial courts strive to mitigate fear to ensure fairness and protect legal rights. Our work is critical for ensuring public safety and the efficient administration of justice....
“The federal and state governments share power in countless ways, and our roles and responsibilities are balanced for the public good... But enforcement policies that include stalking courthouses and arresting undocumented immigrants, the vast majority of whom pose no risk to public safety, are neither safe nor fair. They not only compromise our core value of fairness but they undermine the judiciary’s ability to provide equal access to justice. I respectfully request that you refrain from this sort of enforcement in California's courthouses.”6
 
Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh sent a letter to the DHS asking the federal government to make courthouses, schools and hospital “safe harbors” from immigration enforcement, for similar public policy reasons, and emphasizing that new federal policies sow fear in immigrant communities and compromise public safety.7
His letter is only a request, and there is no guarantee that ICE would refrain from immigration enforcement in Maryland’s schools, hospitals and courthouses—and the facts show they are not.

For too many Americans, voting remains a struggle. Registering a hastle. And Ohio has chosen to make it worse. Removing voters from the rolls just because they don’t vote every election is nuts. 
We have a law, the National Voter Registration Act, that was designed to protect voting, ease voter registration, ensure states keep good rolls. The law allows states to remove a voter from the rolls only if they become ineligible. In fact. It prohibits states from removing voters for not voting.

"""With the Supreme Court split four-to-four on so many critical issues, the stakes could not be higher.""
Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member Feinstein, Senators, thank you for the privilege of testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee today.
My name is Heather McGhee and I am the President of Demos, a public policy organization working for an America where we all have an equal say in our democracy and an equal chance in our economy.
I’ve come here today to urge this Committee to reject President Trump’s nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to a lifetime appointment on the nation’s highest court.
With the Supreme Court split four-to-four on so many critical issues, the stakes could not be higher. Judge Gorsuch has gone out of his way to support the wealthy and powerful over the rest of us, often breaking with his appellate court colleagues to do so.1 On issues ranging from Wall Street accountability and workers’ rights to criminal justice and the environment, he would move the country backwards.2
Beyond these critical topics, what’s at stake today is the very shape and structure of our democracy: the way we make decisions about everything from who gets health care to whether a family with a full time worker will live in poverty; and whose voices are heard in that process.
Judge Neil Gorsuch has the potential to be the deciding vote to destroy the few remaining protections against big money dominating our democracy. His troubling record on money in politics, especially when added to the rest of his record of favoring wealthy interests over the rights of ordinary people, requires this Committee to reject his nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court.3
I’d like to make three basic points in this testimony.
First, the way we fund our election campaigns in the U.S. enables wealthy individuals and institutions to translate their economic might directly into political power—and that is a serious problem for our democracy.
Second, putting Judge Gorsuch into a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court will make this worse, and could return us to an era in which powerful interests ran roughshod over workers, consumers, and anyone without a large checkbook and financial megaphone of their own.
Finally, there is an overwhelming bipartisan consensus supporting safeguards for our democracy, and Judge Neil Gorsuch is far outside that consensus. The public cares broadly and deeply about building a democracy where we can all be heard. Your constituents want you to stand up against big money, and your vote on this pivotal Supreme Court seat will be one of the best chances you will ever have to do so.
Our democracy is already under threat, with average voters convinced that their government is working not for them, but for powerful interests and the wealthy few.4 This should not surprise us when so much of the $7 billion spent on 2016 federal elections came from so few.5 The concentration of political spending is even more severe than the increasing concentration of wealth afflicting our broader society.6
Just 25 people pumped more than $600 million into last year’s elections through political action committees, Super PACs, and direct contributions to candidates and parties.7 Less than 1 percent of the population provides the majority of the funds that determine who runs for office, who wins elections, and what issues get attention from our elected officials.8
These big donors and spenders aren’t reflective of the country—they’re wealthier, obviously, but they are also less likely to be women or people of color, and they have starkly different priorities when it comes to core public policies such as fair wages or debt free college.9
Studies show that candidates of color are less likely to run for office due to the money barrier and raise substantially less when they do.10 This is a key reason 90 percent of elected officials across the country are white—despite the fact that nearly 40 percent of us across this great country are people of color.11
The result is that the deck is stacked, as Demos has shown in a series of reports with that name.12 Our public policies are skewed towards top donors’ preferences, and away from working families and people of color as a whole.
Princeton political scientist Martin Gilens has demonstrated that when the preferences of the wealthiest 10 percent of Americans conflict with those of the rest of the population, the 10 percent trumps the 90 percent.13 He concluded that “under most circumstances, the preferences of the vast majority of Americans appear to have essentially no impact on which policies the government does or doesn’t adopt” and that “patterns of responsiveness...often correspond more closely to a plutocracy than to a democracy.”14
This combination of disparate preferences and differential responsiveness creates a vicious cycle: the wealthy translate their economic might into political power; this allows them to write rules for our economy that keep them on top while working families struggle to stay afloat; which in turn allows the wealthiest few to pump even more money into politics each year. As we lather, rinse, and repeat in this vicious cycle, we take our democracy ever farther from the vision of political equality embodied in the principle of one person, one vote.
As senators, every member of this Committee has had to run for office in our big money system; so you know this problem better than most. You know, for example, that anyone wanting to run for a seat in the United States Senate needs to raise $3,300 every single day for six years just to match the median winner.15 This equals the total income the average worker earns in a month.16
Put another way, more than 2,000 times over the course of six years you have to be able to go out and find people who can give you $3,000 or $4,000 in just one day. And who are those contributors? Most of them are not your typical constituents. One of your colleagues, Senator Chris Murphy, was admirably frank about who he is reaching out to when dialing for dollars and the effect that has on the type of worldviews he’s exposed to on a daily basis. When making fundraising appeals, he said he’s “not call[ing] anyone who could not drop at least $1,000,” people who he estimated make at least $500,000 to $1 million per year.17
I talked a lot more about carried interest inside of that call room than I did in the supermarket . . . [The people I’m calling] have fundamentally different problems than other people. And in Connecticut especially, you spend a lot of time on the phone with people who work in the financial markets. And so you’re hearing a lot about problems that bankers have and not a lot of problems that people who work at the mill in Thomaston, Conn., have. You certainly have to stop and check yourself.18
Senator Murphy is not alone. In the 2012 elections, 64 percent of the money your Senate colleagues and their election opponents raised from individual donors came in contributions of at least $1,000, from just 0.04 percent of the population.19
That doesn’t just skew your colleagues’ worldviews; it acts as a critical barrier to entry. Most Americans can’t hope to raise that much money from so few people—they just aren’t that well connected to the one percent of the one percent. This is one of the reasons the Senate has far fewer women than it should, and only 10 African Americans, Latinos, or Asian Americans.20
This is certainly not the democracy our Constitution mandates, or the one the public wants or deserves. Rather, this is the distorted democracy that Supreme Court decisions have forced upon us—a broken system where the size of our wallets determines the strength of our voices.
Supreme Court rulings have played a central role in creating and sustaining the current crisis. The justices’ flawed approach to money in politics has shredded a series of common-sense protections against the power of special interests and wealthy individuals.21
At the heart of this flawed approach is the misguided notion that the people and our representatives may limit political contributions or spending only to fight corruption or its appearance, narrowly defined as cash-for-votes exchanges.22 Fighting corruption is important, but clean governance is not the only value at stake when concentrated wealth meets public power. There are also critical questions at play regarding the integrity of our democracy, full participation in our political system, and the relationship between economic might and political power.
Over several decades, the Court has struck down some of the most effective common-sense protections against big money, taking the following policy options off the table: limits on how much personal or family wealth candidates can spend on their own campaigns; limits on total candidate spending; limits on contributions to, or spending by, individuals or groups supposedly not connected to candidates’ campaigns; limits on contributions to ballot initiatives; bans on corporate spending on ballot initiatives; strict contribution limits set at levels that average Americans can afford to give; bans on corporate spending on candidate elections; providing additional “matching funds” to publicly financed candidates who face big money spending by opposing candidates or interest groups; and limits on the total amount one wealthy donor can contribute to candidates, parties, and political committees in an election cycle.23
A recent Demos report called Court Cash: 2016 Election Money Resulting Directly From Supreme Court Rulings quantified the Court’s impact for the first time.24 We found that Supreme Court rulings enabled more than $3 billion in 2016 election spending, including more than three-quarters of the money spent in the most competitive congressional races.25
The most damaging Roberts Court rulings have been five-to-four decisions in which the majority’s basic assumptions about politics have been proven false, including the idea that so- called “independent expenditures” are actually independent of candidates and can’t be corrupting, or that disclosure laws would be comprehensive or effective by themselves in reining in the influence of big money.26 With a Supreme Court responsive to the facts rather than ideology we could end Super PACs and get corporate money back out of our elections.
The next Supreme Court justice will have a pivotal role in ensuring our Constitution protects the rights and voices of all Americans. We need a ninth justice who understands that a true democracy cannot elevate big money over the voices of ordinary people and who will be open to reasonable limits on campaign spending. But from all we know of his record, Judge Neil Gorsuch would take us further down the Roberts Court’s extreme path.
Judge Gorsuch models himself after Justice Scalia, an extreme skeptic of protections against big money, and his own record speaks volumes.27 Judge Gorsuch has faced two directly relevant cases. In Hobby Lobby, he voted to expand First Amendment rights for corporations, building on Citizens United’s troubling logic.28 In Riddle v. Hickenlooper, he signaled openness to applying the harshest possible standard of review to campaign contribution limits—giving financial contributions a level of protection that the Supreme Court has not always afforded even our precious right to vote.29
Judge Gorsuch’s Riddle concurrence is notable because he went out of his way to write an opinion to discuss a matter—the potential for strict scrutiny—that was not necessary to decide the case; and because he cited non-majority opinions by Justice Thomas and Chief Justice Burger suggesting that all contribution limits should be subject to this type of review.30 Given the opportunity by Senator Klobuchar to clarify his perspective on the subject during this hearing, Judge Gorusch shed no meaningful light on his views.31
Taken together, these opinions show that Judge Gorsuch would be receptive to the anticipated attacks on our few remaining democratic safeguards. Even a relatively narrow reading suggests he would vote to strike down the current bans on both soft money contributions to political parties and corporations contributing directly to candidates.32 If confirmed, he could have the opportunity to do so in short order. The Supreme Court could hear a soft money challenge soon; and an ongoing case in Texas presents a challenge to the corporate ban.33
Judge Gorsuch’s opinions also appear to take one more step towards applying “strict scrutiny” to all contribution limits. We could see jurisdictions required to supply an absurd level of evidence to justify common-sense limits—such as proving the going rate to bribe local politicians is $5,001 to support a $5,000 contribution limit. Ultimately, dozens of contribution limits could be wiped away, creating a Wild West atmosphere for donors and politicians.
In a world where Judge Gorsuch joins a majority bloc of pro-big money justices, the vicious cycle churns ever faster. Large corporations and wealthy individuals enjoy virtually unlimited ability to translate their economic might into political power. Our legislatures and other elected offices become even more skewed by race and class; policy becomes even more tilted towards the preferences of a donor class that is disproportionately male and largely excludes people of color; and working families and people of color across the nation continue to fall behind economically and be alienated politically.34
In this world, we could return to the scandal-plagued days of unlimited soft money contributions to political parties.35 We could see oil companies, Wall Street banks, and secret money groups giving directly to candidates—something that hasn’t happened since 1907.36 And we could see contribution limits fall across the country, encouraging politicians to seek out only the views of the largest check-writers and ignore the middle and working classes.
Let’s not forget what life was like before we banned corporations from dominating our politics in the first place. Workers were run ragged in round-the-clock shifts with meager pay, and regularly died on the job.37 The right of laborers to form a union was not protected by state or federal law, and union organizers often faced violence.38 The massive gap between rich and poor Americans was especially apparent to labor organizer Mary Harris (“Mother”) Jones who noticed a breakout of Yellow Fever was killing predominantly poor and working class people, while wealthy individuals had the resources to avoid the disease or get proper treatment.39 She described the conditions at the turn of the Twentieth Century that drove her organizing:
Hours of work down under ground were cruelly long. Fourteen hours a day was not uncommon, thirteen, twelve. The life or limb of the miner was unprotected by any laws. Families lived in company-owned shacks that were not fit for their pigs. Children died by the hundreds due to the ignorance and poverty of their parents.40
It was against this backdrop of robber barons hoarding wealth at the expense of the poor and vulnerable that our longstanding history of limiting corporate political contributions emerged. 
The public is counting on this Committee, and the Senate as a whole, not to let this happen again. Americans are deeply concerned about the impact of concentrated wealth on our democracy and understand the role of the Court. Ninety-four percent of voters believe that the power of big money in politics is a problem, and 90 percent say that the Supreme Court plays an important role in setting the rules.41
This is reflected in the fact that 110 members of Congress have taken the unusual step of writing to this Committee to request that its members press Judge Gorsuch on his record and views on money in politics.42 This call was joined in a similar letter from 121 organizations representing millions of members concerned with democracy, civil rights, workers’ rights, environmental protection, faith values, and more.43
Outside the Beltway, this is not a partisan issue at all. Ninety-one percent of President Trump’s own voters thought it was important that he appoint someone to the Supreme Court who is open to limiting big money.41 Seventy percent of Republicans say that Congress should reject any nominee “who will help the wealthy and privileged wield too much power in our elections.”45
In fact, 85% of Americans believe we need fundamental changes to our system for funding political campaigns.46 The influence of special interest money is the biggest problem voters have with politicians.47
The American people are demanding change to a political system that favors the already-wealthy and well-connected. Put simply, Judge Gorsuch has not shown sufficient commitment to our constitutional values of liberty, equality, and justice for all to earn Demos’ support, or yours. We urge you to vote against Judge Gorsuch’s confirmation, and tell your constituents that a key reason you did was to stand with them over big money. They will thank you. ",testimony-and-public-comment
"By passing this proposed constitutional amendment, and laying the groundwork to enact SDR, Maryland would become the 10th state to permit eligible citizens to both register and vote on the same day.1 The District of Columbia also enacted Same Day Registration in 2010.  SDR is available there on Election Day and/or the early voting period. One state has no statewide registration requirement at all.2  All these states have shown increased voter turnout, with minimal costs and no compromise to the electoral system.
Same Day Registration unquestionably boosts overall voter turnout.  Further, evidence suggests that it especially does so for traditionally low-turnout groups.  If Maryland were to adopt an SDR system similar to that which exists elsewhere,
The purpose of voter registration in the United States is to make sure that only eligible citizens vote. Voter registration also provides election officials with convenient lists they can use to notify voters about upcoming elections, as well as other information about elections and voting. Lastly, when individuals enter a polling place, a voter registration list gives poll workers the information they need to authenticate voters before they cast ballots. At the same time, the process of voter registration imposes costs on voters—such as forcing voters to register well in advance of an election, which might involve a complicated process of determining where and how to register—and these costs have been shown in various studies to serve as barriers to many potential voters.5 Many voting rights experts agree that pre-Election Day registration deadlines have contributed to lower turnout among eligible voters in the United States.
America is a highly mobile society. According to the US Census Bureau, over 35 million individuals changed residences in 2011.6 Many of these individuals fail to register to vote before the registration deadline, and find themselves unable to cast a ballot. Others who have timely submitted their voter registration applications will find on Election Day that their names had not been added to the voter rolls and that their votes will not be counted. Same Day Registration remedies both these problems. Voters simply register to vote on Election Day or during the early voting period, and cast a ballot that will be counted.
States with Same Day Registration show that the system works. SDR states as a group have historically boasted an average voter turnout rate of 10 to 12 percentage points higher than non-SDR states.7  Academic studies show that a significant part of this difference is directly attributable to SDR. Experts predict that adoption of SDR can increase turnout by a full three to six percentage points.8  And increased voter participation can be achieved without administrative burden or increased incidence of voter fraud.9

"Not since the aftermath of the Watergate scandal has Congress introduced so bold a proposal to enhance our democracy. 
Thank you, Chairperson Lofgren, Ranking Member Davis, and all members of the Committee, for the opportunity to testify in support of H.R. 1, the For the People Act—the boldest and most comprehensive proposal to strengthen our democracy since the aftermath of Watergate.
My name is Chiraag Bains, and I am Director of Legal Strategies for Demos. Demos is a public policy and advocacy organization working for an America where we all have an equal say in our democracy and an equal chance in our economy. Our name—meaning “the people”—is the root word of democracy, and it reminds us that, in America, the true source of our greatness is the diversity of our people.
We at Demos stand in strong support of the For the People Act, a visionary bill that can transform our democracy by addressing the deep political, racial, and economic inequalities that hold us back.
The bill would strengthen voting rights by expanding access to the polls, modernizing voter registration, requiring independent redistricting, and protecting voters from aggressive purging—including by correcting the Supreme Court’s wrongheaded 5-4 decision in Demos’ case against Ohio’s use-it-or-lose-it system, Husted v. A. Philip Randolph Institute. It would commit to restoring the full protections of the Voting Rights Act, the evisceration of which in Shelby v. Holder has unleashed restrictive voting laws across the country, and make findings related to structural democracy reforms like DC statehood and voting rights in the territories. The legislation would also curtail the corrupting role of big money in politics, which drowns out the voices of everyday people, and promote more equitable ways to finance federal campaigns. It incorporates the Government By the People Act, which Demos has long supported and which would amplify the voices of small-dollar donors and allow more candidates of color and low-income candidates to run on the issues that matter to their constituents. And the bill would put new ethics restrictions in place for federal officials at a time when we badly need them.
It is fitting that the For the People Act address both voting rights and the role of big money in politics in the same legislative package, because they are truly two sides of the same coin. Whether Americans of all races are fighting for access to the ballot box or to curb the outsized influence of a tiny slice of wealthy donors over who runs for office and who wins elections, the fight is essentially to become a full member of society with an equal say over the decisions that affect our lives.
Voter suppression—sometimes through blatantly racist maneuvers, sometimes through sophisticated, ostensibly race-neutral tactics—poses an existential threat to our democracy. We must put a stop to these practices and protect the fundamental right to vote. The vote lacks its full meaning, however, if voters cannot cast their ballots for candidates who reflect the priorities of everyday Americans. For generations, communities of color and working-class people have gone unseen by politicians who court rich individual donors and corporate interests. The high cost of running for office has also been a barrier to entry for candidates of color, resulting in a political class that is disproportionately white. Moreover, the combination of voter suppression and big money in politics has serious racial equity consequences. The problems that are most pressing for people of color—economic inequality, education disparities, police abuse, to name a few—are sidelined, neglected, and in some cases, made worse.
In short, our democracy faces substantial and complicated challenges. It will take a big legislative package to address them. H.R. 1, the For the People Act, has the range and depth to help us build the truly inclusive democracy that Americans deserve.
 
When it passed the Voting Rights Act (VRA) in 1965, Congress took a major step toward fulfilling the promise of the Fifteenth Amendment that no citizen would be denied the right to vote “on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.”1 The centerpiece of the Act was a provision requiring certain states and other jurisdictions to get approval from the federal government before making any changes to their voting practices and procedures. This “preclearance” protection applied to jurisdictions with a history of voting discrimination and helped to protect the right to vote for marginalized populations. Five years ago, in Shelby County v. Holder, the Supreme Court struck down the formula used to determine what jurisdictions were subject to preclearance, declaring that “[o]ur country has changed” and voting discrimination was no longer a major concern. In a 5-4 decision split along ideological lines, the Court stripped voters in nine states and dozens of counties and municipalities of the protection Congress had put in place.2
Since Shelby County, at least 23 states have implemented new restrictions on voting, including onerous ID measures, cuts to early voting, and polling place closures.3 By 2018, 34 states had some form of voter ID law on their books; 17 of those requested photo IDs,4 to which roughly 11 percent of the American population does not have access.5 That 11 percent is disproportionately comprised of voters of color, seniors, or low-income citizens.
We know these restrictive laws keep voters of color from full participation in our democracy. Recent survey research shows that black and Latino voters are three times as likely as white voters to encounter hurdles when trying to vote. They are more likely to be unable to take time off from work to go to the polls, be told that they do not have a proper form of ID, discover that their name is not on the list of registered voters, and be harassed or bothered at the polls.6
The following cases studies provide evidence that voter suppression is on the rise:
North Carolina
North Carolina’s photo ID law—passed as part of a larger package slashing strong elections reforms, including early voting and same-day registration, immediately after the Supreme Court decided Shelby County—had both the intent and effect of disenfranchising black voters. Court documents showed that legislators had requested from county officials information as to which demographic groups had access to which IDs, and that only those IDs whites had greater access to made it into the list of approved forms of voter ID. As the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals noted, legislators there “target[ed] African-Americans with almost surgical precision.”7 Because the full protections of the VRA haven’t yet been restored, North Carolina attempted once again to create the electorate of its choosing through a new photo ID law that it passed in the lame-duck period after the 2018 election. Restoration of the VRA could have prevented this.
Texas
On the same day the U.S. Supreme Court eviscerated protections for voters of color in Shelby v. Holder, the Texas legislature introduced the country’s most antagonistic ID bill against black and brown voters, demanding as a prerequisite to voting one of several photo IDs that hundreds of thousands of Texas voters lack. The Fifth Circuit upheld the lower court’s finding that the law—which permitted a voter to cast a ballot after showing a gun permit but not a state university-issued ID—had a discriminatory effect on voters of color. Rather than scrap the law altogether, Texas legislators reworked the legislation to keep many provisions in place, which the appellate court upheld for the 2018 election.
Georgia
Many have called Georgia “ground zero” for vote suppression, and with good reason. For years, former State Secretary Brian Kemp, now Governor, targeted for removal from voter registration rolls individuals who had missed just a couple of federal elections. As a result, hundreds of thousands of legitimate voters have been cut from the rolls and, unless they re-registered, were precluded from voting in 2018. Right before the midterm, moreover, the Secretary of State’s office placed 53,000 voter registration applications—70 percent of which belonged to black voters—in “pending” status. Georgia’s “Exact Match” law, which requires information from voter registration applications to match up exactly with other state agency records, enabled elections officials to avoid processing records with even slight mis-matches (such as the omission of a hyphen).8   More often than not, county and agency error is to blame for the mismatches.9 Had it not been for a successful lawsuit filed by advocacy groups,10 tens of thousands of Georgians would have lost their right to vote in the 2018 midterm elections. Litigation helps restore rights on a case-by-case basis, but comprehensive reform, as provided for in the For the People Act, would prevent much of this illegal behavior from occurring in the first place.
Because of these ongoing attempts to suppress the vote, particularly for voters of color, Demos calls for full restoration of the Voting Rights Act’s protections, and we applaud H.R. 1’s inclusion of Subtitle A in Title II reaffirming Congress’s commitment to restore the Voting Rights Act.
 
1.     Voter purges
Over the past several years, handfuls of states have made voter registration—already a burdensome requirement—even more restrictive. Examples from Dēmos’ litigation in Ohio, Indiana, and Texas show how purges exclude voters of color from the political process.
Ohio
Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court considered Husted v. A. Philip Randolph Institute, a case challenging Ohio’s practice of using non-voting to initiate a voter purge process. Overturning the Sixth Circuit’s decision, the Court held that practices like Ohio’s do not violate the National Voter Registration Act’s (NVRA) prohibition on roll-maintenance programs or activities that “result in the removal of the name of any person” from the registration rolls “by reason of the person’s failure to vote.”11
Members of Congress made clear during Supreme Court briefing that Section 8 of the NVRA was designed to prevent purge practices like Ohio’s.12 H.R. 1 would amend Section 8 of the NVRA to address the Husted decision and prohibit states from initiating a purge procedure based on non-voting—a metric that simply does not reliably indicate that a voter has moved, and the use of which disproportionately targets, removes, and disenfranchises traditionally marginalized persons from the registration rolls.
As numerous amici in Husted explained, barriers to voting such as transportation issues, inflexible work schedules, care-giving responsibilities, illnesses, inaccessible polling locations, and language access problems can disproportionately prevent persons of color, housing-insecure individuals, persons with disabilities, low-income individuals, older voters, and persons with limited English proficiency from making it to the polls to vote.13 Using a person’s failure to vote to initiate a removal process will therefore disproportionately target such groups and result in their subsequent removal from the registration rolls. This was borne out in an analysis of the number of infrequent voters purged in Hamilton County, Ohio from 2012 through 2015, which found that “African-American-majority neighborhoods in downtown Cincinnati had 10 percent of their voters removed due to inactivity, compared to only four percent of voters in a suburban, majority-white neighborhood.”14
Indiana
In 2017, Indiana adopted a law requiring elections officials to purge voters on Crosscheck’s list of “Potential Double Registrants” without first notifying them or offering a chance to correct or verify Crosscheck’s information. Crosscheck, the brainchild of former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, purports to identify people who register and vote in multiple states. But its formula for matching voter registration records across more than half the states is fundamentally flawed, resulting in millions of people being falsely flagged as double registrants. According to a 2008 study,15 finding different people with identical first names, last names, and date of birth—the only criteria Crosscheck uses to flag duplicate registrations, even when other information conflicts—is surprisingly common. What is not surprising is that Crosscheck is wrong an estimated 99 percent of the time.[fn value=""16""]Sharad Goel et al., One Person, One Vote: Estimating the Prevalence of Double Voting in U.S. Presidential Elections (Oct. 24, 2017), available at https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/morse/files/1p1v.pdf. Once voters have been flagged under this flawed formula, they are then subjected to scrutiny and can be purged from the voter rolls.
In a major win for Indiana voters, U.S. District Judge Tanya Walton Pratt granted Demos’ motion for a preliminary injunction in Common Cause v. Lawson and blocked the law. Had it gone into effect, though, many voters would not have learned they’d been purged until they showed up at the polls. But voters in Ohio don’t have the same protection as Hoosiers do. And the problem with the Supreme Court’s holding in Husted is that now any state can adopt these sorts of practices, without strong legislation prohibiting them.  
Texas
Just last week, Demos and its partners filed a lawsuit and an emergency motion to stop Texas from discriminating against voters of color and purging naturalized citizens who are eligible to vote from the voter rolls. David Whitley, Texas’s Secretary of State, recently made highly publicized accusations that 95,000 non-citizens may be registered to vote and that 58,000 may have actually voted in the state’s elections, based on DMV records. That claim is false. It is based on data the state knows is flawed, and it ignores the reality that many people who were lawfully in the country when they applied for a driver’s license or state ID, years ago, have now become naturalized citizens—entitled to full voting rights under our Constitution.
That did not stop Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton from issuing  a reckless “VOTER FRAUD ALERT” and President Donald Trump tweeting about voter fraud and calling it “just the tip of the iceberg.” Moreover, the Secretary has encouraged county election officials to send notices to these individuals and, if they don’t respond with documentary proof of citizenship within 30 days, purge them from the voting rolls.
These heedless accusations have left thousands of naturalized citizens outraged and fearful that their hard-won right to vote is in jeopardy. Nivien Saleh, a Harris County voter and one of our clients, gained her citizenship in January 2018, after living lawfully in the U.S. under a student visa and then an H1B visa since 1997. In a declaration filed with the court, Ms. Saleh describes her experience voting for the first time in the March 2018 Texas primaries as “the culmination of many years of hard work” and “an experience I will always remember.” Finding herself wrongly accused of unlawfully registering to vote has left Ms. Saleh “apprehensive, insulted and angry.” She explains, “I have worked hard to be a productive, law-abiding citizen,” and says that the Secretary’s false accusation “disturbs me deeply.”
Attempts to purge eligible voters from the rolls—as we’ve seen recently in Ohio, Indiana, and Texas—undo the work that goes into registering eligible citizens. Numerous states have noted that “voter inactivity is a poor measure to identify ineligible voters” and that “[t]here is no pressing need for States to target nonvoters,” as much more credible evidence exists to determine if a voter has become ineligible.17 Amending Section 8 of the NVRA to prevent states from using non-voting alone to initiate removal procedures would uphold the NVRA’s expressed purposes of increasing the number of citizens registered to vote, increasing participation, and “ensure that accurate and current voter registration rolls are maintained.”18 It would also help prevent qualified voters from being removed from the registration rolls and becoming disenfranchised.
If Congress is committed to voter registration reform, then it must also preserve those registrations through protections against aggressive attempts to remove them from the rolls. H.R. 1 takes a holistic approach to registration and appropriately includes Title I, Subtitle A, Part 4 on conditions for removal on the basis of interstate cross-checks and Title II, Subtitle F with a section on saving voters from purging.
 
2.     Intimidation at the polling place
In our 2012 report Bullies at the Ballot Box,19 Demos and Common Cause highlighted the impact that illegal interference and intimidation can have on eligible voters at the polls. Organizers affiliated with True the Vote, for example, have claimed that their goal is to train one million poll watchers to challenge and confront other Americans as they go to the polls. They say they want to make the experience of voting “like driving and seeing the police following you.”20 There is a real danger that voters will face overzealous volunteers who take the law into their own hands to target voters they deem suspect.
Even in states with clear legal boundaries for challengers and poll watchers, too often these boundaries are crossed. Laws intended to ensure voting integrity are instead used to make it harder for eligible citizens to vote—particularly those in communities of color. Moreover, the laws of many states fall short when it comes to preventing improper voter caging and challenges. This should concern anyone who wants a fair election with a legitimate result that reflects the choices of all eligible Americans. There is no place for bullies at the ballot box, and government has a responsibility to protect voters from illegal interference and intimidation.
Clear rules can help prevent interference with voter rights. That’s why Subtitles C and D from Title I of H.R. 1 on preventing caging and voter intimidation are key provisions for the improvement and safeguarding of our elections.
 
Registration is still the number-one barrier to participation in our democracy. Fifty to 60 million eligible voters, disproportionately people of color, remain unregistered. Demos has worked for years to enforce the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 to ensure that every eligible American, when conducting a transaction at a motor vehicle office or public assistance agency, gets the opportunity to register to vote. We estimate that our NVRA compliance work across nearly two dozen states has resulted in more than 3 million new voter registration applications being submitted through public assistance agencies under Section 7 of the NVRA alone.21
Millions of United States citizens find elections more accessible because of the NVRA, but significant hurdles remain. In the November 2016 general election, nearly 1 in 5 (18 percent) people who were eligible but did not vote cited registration issues as their main reason for not casting a ballot.22 We are proud of the work we have done to ensure compliance with the NVRA, but we know that states can and should do much more when it comes to registering eligible voters.
That’s why we have conducted research on and advocated for reforms such as same-day registration (SDR) and automatic voter registration (AVR), both of which increase registration rates and boost participation—particularly among voters of color and youth. SDR increases turnout by upwards of 10 percentage points,23 and AVR is expected to increase participation significantly as well. Due to the efforts of Demos and other advocates, 17 states and the District of Columbia now have SDR.
While some states have moved to restrict access to the ballot box, others are taking appropriate steps to adopt measures like online, same-day, and automatic voter registration. Yet more can and should be done to ensure that all Americans, no matter where they live, have access to the kinds of registration reform that H.R. 1 addresses. 
With voter registration modernization—including online, automatic, and same-day voter registration, as required by H.R. 1’s Title I, Subtitle A—low-income voters of color will be brought into the system and will have greater access to the ballot. This package of reforms has the potential to shrink and perhaps even eliminate the great registration divide between low- and high-income Americans.
 
Felony disenfranchisement laws in the United States have troubling race and class dimensions that cannot be reconciled with our shared present-day values of equal citizenship and equal dignity. Scholar Ward Elliott has observed that the spread of disenfranchisement laws may have been a response to the abolition of property-holding requirements, which “had served a number of indispensable functions, such as holding down the voting strength of free blacks, women, infants, criminals, mental incompetents, unpropertied immigrants, and transients.”24 After Reconstruction, states in the South began to tailor their disenfranchisement laws to cover crimes for which black citizens were most frequently prosecuted, “as part of a larger effort to disfranchise African American voters and to restore the Democratic Party to political dominance.”25 Over time, states stopped distinguishing between kinds of crimes, instead imposing blanket disenfranchisement for all felony convictions.
Although states have repudiated discriminatory barriers to voting such as poll taxes and literacy tests, criminal disenfranchisement laws have persisted. And they continue to have a disproportionate racial impact due to the pervasive racial bias in the criminal justice system. As we noted in a letter that Demos and 19 other national organizations wrote in support of a New Mexico bill to end felony disenfranchisement,26 African Americans and Latinos make up 32 percent of the U.S. population but in 2015 comprised 56 percent of all incarcerated persons in the country.27 This is because individuals of color are prosecuted and sentenced at much higher rates than whites for comparable behavior. For example, in a national survey on drug use, it was reported that “African Americans and whites use drugs at similar rates, but the imprisonment rate of African Americans for drug charges is almost six times that of whites.”28 African Americans “represent 12.5 percent of illicit drug users, but 29 percent of those arrested for drug offense and 33 percent of those incarcerated in state facilities for drug offenses.”29
Because people of color are policed, prosecuted, convicted, and incarcerated for crimes at disproportionately higher rates than whites, they lose their right to vote at disproportionately higher rates too. As a result, the electorate is disproportionately white. Communities of color experience reduced political power and the underrepresentation of their interests in government. Ending felony disenfranchisement, therefore, would help restore equality and equity to the democratic process. It would also aid with reentry and promote public safety.30
As such, we applaud the inclusion of Title I, Subtitle E, the Democracy Restoration Act, in the For the People Act.31
 
The struggle for fair and equal access to the ballot continues, and our nation has taken some tragic steps backwards in recent years. But even when we win full and equal voting rights, our work will not be complete. As Demos has explained elsewhere,32 there is another substantial barrier to fair and equal representation for people of color as well as working-class Americans of all races: the role of big money in determining who runs for office, who wins elections, and what issues are prioritized in Washington, D.C. and state capitals. Overcoming the barrier of big money to equal representation is part of the unfinished business of the civil rights struggle.
Now the biggest barrier to people of color (as well as all low-income Americans) is not the all-white primary33 but rather the “wealth primary,”34 through which the wealthy, white donor class filters the candidate pool before anyone has the chance to cast a single vote. These wealthy donors act as gatekeepers up and down the ballot. The biggest spenders do not always win their races, but raising millions, tens of millions, or even hundreds of millions of dollars is currently a prerequisite to compete for federal office. If you want to run for president these days, you need a billionaire or two willing to fund a Super PAC dedicated to your cause. If you want to run for Congress, you typically need hundreds of people willing and able to write $2,000 or $5,000 checks. To match the average 2014 U.S. Senate winner, you would need to raise $3,300 every single day for six years.35

While occasionally candidates with broad national appeal are able to raise tens of millions of dollars from a broad network of online small donors, the vast majority rely on large donors to reach the threshold amount they need to compete. One study of 2014 competitive congressional races found, for example, that “[o]nly two of 50 candidates in these competitive races raised less than 70 percent of their individual funds from large donors, while seven relied on big donors for more than 95 percent of their individual contributions.”36
The role of big money in restricting alternatives is one big reason why more than 90 percent of elected officials are white, only two percent of members of Congress have ever had working-class backgrounds, and tens of millions of Americans choose to stay home each Election Day.
Over more than two centuries of Court cases and constitutional amendments, the American people have decided that access to the ballot should not depend upon race, geography or wealth. In a democracy, the size of your wallet isn’t supposed to determine the strength of your voice. Under “one person, one vote,” each American must have an equal say over the decisions that affect our lives.
Unfortunately, rich and powerful corporations have far greater say than the rest of us. They use their wealth to amplify their own voices and drown out those of middle- and working-class Americans. This donor class is overwhelming wealthy, white, and male—deeply unrepresentative of the United States in 2019—and it tends to support the election of disproportionately wealthy, white, and male public officials. At the same time, these donor-gatekeepers’ interests diverge sharply from those of everyday people, particularly people of color, and yet they routinely win out in the arenas of legislative debate. In short, our big-money political system actively undermines racial equity and gives us public policy out of step with the needs and preferences of the American public.
The For the People Act would help curb the influence of big money in our elections and advance racial equity. Particularly through the small-donor match and democracy voucher pilot program in Title V of the bill, the Act would lower barriers to entry for candidates of color, amplify the influence of people of color and low-income individuals so that they can be heard alongside those of special interests, and promote more equitable public policy.
 
A history of racial subordination and ongoing racial discrimination has compounded to produce a striking racial wealth gap in America. The Forbes 400 billionaires have as much wealth as the entire black population and a quarter of the Latino population combined. The median white household owns $140,500 in wealth, compared to just $3,400 for black households and $6,300 for Latino households.37 Put another way, the top 1 percent are more than 90 percent white; the top 10 percent are 85-90 percent white.38 These are the groups that dominate political giving in America.39

Just 25 people pumped more than $600 million into the 2016 elections through political action committees, Super PACs, and direct contributions to candidates and parties.40 Less than 1 percent of the population provides the majority of the funds that determine who runs for office, who wins elections, and what issues get attention from our elected officials.41
Election donors, and especially the mega-donors driving campaigns, are overwhelming white.  Ninety-two percent of federal election donors in 2014 and 91 percent of donors in 2012 were white. The numbers are even more skewed among large donors. Ninety-four percent of those giving more than $5,000 in 2014 and 93 percent in 2012 were white. Men make up slightly less than half of the population, but comprised 63 percent of federal election donors in 2012 and 66 percent of donors in 2014. The pool of donors who give more than $1,000 has less gender diversity, with men making up 65 percent of donors giving more than $5,000.42
By comparison to white Americans, people of color lack access to networks of wealthy friends, associates, and business interests, making it difficult for them to raise the funds needed to be viable candidates. And when candidates of color do run, they raise less money than their white counterparts. A study of more than 3,000 candidates running in more than 2,000 state legislative races in 2006 found that adjusting for factors such as incumbency, partisanship, and district income, “non-white candidates raise an average of 47 percent less compared to white candidates when all other mitigating factors are controlled.”43 In the South, candidates of color raised nearly 64 percent less than white candidates.44 Other studies show that business interests across a host of fields—manufacturing, retail, finance, insurance, real estate, and energy—give more to white candidates.45 White candidates are also far more likely to be in a position to self-fund their campaigns.46
The candidate with the most money does not always win—just an overwhelming majority of the time. In a typical cycle, 90 percent or more of candidates who raise the most money prevail.[fn value=""47""]More than 90% of the biggest campaign fundraisers and spenders routinely win elected office. Money does not always win the day, but raising more money certainly gives a candidate a better chance to win. See Center for Responsive Politics, Money Wins Presidency and 9 of 10 Congressional Races in Priciest U.S. Election Ever (Nov. 5, 2008), http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2008/11/money-wins-white-house-and/; Wesley Lowery, 91% of the time the better financed candidate wins. Don’t act surprised, Washington Post (April 4, 2014).  In this way, our big-money political system disproportionately excludes people of color from serving in elected office. It should be no surprise, then, that 90 percent of Americans’ elected officials are white, even though 37 percent of us are people of color.48
The wealthy, white donor class has markedly different policy preferences from the general public, and particularly from people of color. For example, on economic policy, polls show that people of color support the role of government in reducing inequality at significantly higher rates (67 percent) than do whites (53 percent) and those earning at least $100,000 (53 percent).49 People of color are also much more likely to list job creation as a priority over holding down the deficit, whereas whites and the wealthy are more likely to say the opposite:

The preference gap plays out on issues beyond the economy, and in some cases touches directly upon issues of racial equity. For example, a majority of whites believe that “blacks and other minori­ties receive equal treatment as whites in the criminal justice system” as do half of those making more than $100,000 per year.50 Yet only 41 percent of those making less than $50,000 believe this, and only 26 percent of people of color.51 And, when asked what is most important to help them achieve the American dream, wealthy and white respondents listed lower taxes as their first priority, whereas people of color listed access to an affordable college education as their top choice.52
The clear differential in policy preferences between the wealthiest Americans and people of color on critical issues means that when Congress focuses on the priorities and preferences of the wealthy, it enacts policies that cater far more to the interests of white house­holds and ignores the priorities of the diverse and vibrant communi­ties of color throughout the United States.
Not only that, studies show that the government is sharply more responsive to the preferences of the wealthy than to those of the average voter. Princeton political scientist Martin Gilens’s groundbreaking work has shown that when the preferences of the top 10 percent of income earners diverge from the rest of us, that 10 percent trumps the 90 percent.53 Another scholar, Larry Bartels, found that “the preferences of people in the bottom third of the income distribution have no apparent impact on the behavior of their elected officials.”54
Because of the overwhelming influence of money in elections—with wealthy candidates running to represent wealthy people’s wants—the interests of everyday Americans, including people of color and low-income individuals, get overlooked or quashed. To take just two examples:
Minimum wage. The federal minimum wage has stagnated for years. It has held steady at $7.25 since 2009 and has been dropping in value due to inflation and rising costs. As Pew Research found, ”today’s real average wage (that is, the wage after accounting for inflation) has about the same purchasing power it did 40 years ago. And what wage gains there have been have mostly flowed to the highest-paid tier of workers.”55 Recent polling, though, indicates that Americans on both sides of the aisle—74 percent (including 58 percent of Republicans)—favor raising the minimum wage.56 Support is especially robust among people of color, but a living wage is not a priority for affluent individuals, with only 40 percent supporting a minimum wage that ensures a family with a full-time worker will not live in poverty.57
The Subprime Lending Crisis and Recovery. Deregulation of large financial institutions led to the subprime housing crisis, which caused borrowers of color to lose between $164 billion and $213 billion from 2000 to 2008—the largest loss of wealth for communities of color in American history.58 Following the financial crisis, the federal government bailed out large banks rather than homeowners who found themselves underwater because of the deceptive and aggressive marketing practices of lenders. Lobbyists for the banking industry successfully eliminated a key provision from the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009 that would have allowed bankruptcy judges to write down mortgages on a primary residence to the current fair market value of the property.59 The banks won this and other victories despite the desire of vast majorities of Americans for greater regulation.60
Congress has repeatedly recognized and attempted to rein in the influence of powerful monied interests in elections. Time and again, however, the Supreme Court has invalidated common-sense protections under the First Amendment, on the misguided theory that all money is speech and that the government’s only legitimate interest in regulating campaign finance is to combat the reality or appearance of quid pro quo bribery. The Supreme Court has struck down:
The result is that millionaires, billionaires, and corporations can use their wealth to amplify their voices and drown out the voices of average Americans. This allows them to translate their economic might into political power, distorting our democracy and making a mockery of the one person, one vote principle. And because people understand this, rulings like Citizens United have reduced the public’s confidence in our system and the people who serve within it. In fact, 85 percent of Americans think we need to “fundamentally change” or “completely rebuild” our system for funding campaigns.69
A promising and constitutional means of fundamentally changing our system exists: public funding of public election campaigns (often referred to as “public financing” for short). Public financing amplifies the voices of ordinary Americans, including people of color, so that elected officials listen to and work for all of their constituents, not just the privileged few.
The For the People Act contains two public financing programs for candidates for the presidency or Congress: (1) a six-to-one match on small dollar donations, up to $200, for candidates who raise 1,000 such contributions or $50,000 in such contributions, and (2) a pilot program of “My Voice” vouchers that would provide eligible voters with $25 to contribute to congressional candidates. These programs have the potential to curb candidates’ reliance on big money, enable more candidates of color to run for office, and avert the corruption and policy distortion that results from our current campaign finance system.
While large donors are overwhelmingly white, there appears to be significant racial diversity among small donors. Research on New York City’s small-donor match program, which provides a six-to-one match on donations up to $175, shows that donors giving $10 or less live in neighborhoods that are more racially diverse than the city as a whole. These donors live in neighborhoods where people of color comprise 62 percent of the population, versus 56 percent of the population of the city overall.70 A similar analysis concluded that small contributors come from a much more diverse range of neighborhoods than large donors and “there can be little doubt that bringing more small donors into the system in New York City equates to a greater diversity in neighborhood experience in the donor pool.”71 In Arizona, meanwhile, the state’s public financing system more than tripled the number of contributors to gubernatorial campaigns between 1998 and 2002 and increased the economic, racial, and geographic diversity of contributors.72 Candidates participating in Arizona’s “clean elections” system raised twice the proportion of their contributions from heavily Latino zip codes than did privately-funded candidates.73
Public financing programs can also produce policy outcomes that better reflect the public’s preferences, including priorities for communities of color that otherwise would go unrealized. Connecticut is a case in point.74 A paid sick leave proposal was bottled up in the Connecticut legislature until the state passed a “fair elections” system that enabled candidates to run for office without depending upon wealthy donors and special interests. Following this change, Connecticut became the first state in the nation to guarantee paid sick leave.75 Because the public financing programs in H.R. 1 could have similar salutary racial justice impacts, Demos strongly supports these provisions.
 
Not since the aftermath of the Watergate scandal has Congress introduced so bold a proposal to enhance our democracy. The For the People Act would make voting more accessible and combat voter suppression efforts, blunt the distorting influence of big money in politics, and advance racial equity. For too long, our system of government has catered to special interests at the expense of the working families and to the detriment of communities of color. Demos strongly supports the For the People Act and looks forward to seeing it signed into law.

"Good morning. My name is Brenda Wright. I am currently Legal Director of the Democracy Program at Demos, a nonprofit research and advocacy organization established in 1999. I thank you for this opportunity to share our views on the important campaign reforms now under consideration by this Committee.
For the past several years, I have had the pleasure of working with Vermont legislators, the Vermont Attorney General’s office, and Vermont advocates and citizens on campaign finance reform issues, including the legal defense of Vermont’s landmark Act 64. I represented a number of legislators who intervened in the lawsuit, including former Rep. Marion Milne, Representative Daryl Pillsbury, the late Rep. Karen Kitzmiller, former Senator Cheryl Rivers, former Sen. Liz Ready, along with VPIRG, the League of Women Voters, the Older Women’s League, and numerous other groups and Vermont citizens.
The legislation before this Committee is an important first step to address the Supreme Court’s decision in Randall v. Sorrell, and to restore basic reasonable contribution limits that will allow Vermont to address the sometimes corrosive effect of money in politics. I believe that a system of full public financing is ultimately the way to go, but I recognize that is not part of the current proposed legislation.

"Thank you Chairpersons Slossberg and Morin, and members of the Government Administration and Elections Committee, for this opportunity testify in support of H.B. 5024. My name is Steven Carbó, Senior Program Director in the Democracy Program at Demos. We are a non-partisan public policy center that works with policy makers, elections officials, and advocates in pursuit of a vibrant democracy with high levels of voting and civic engagement.  Achieving this level of inclusivity requires reducing barriers that prevent all eligible citizens from exercising their right to vote. 
I applaud Governor Dan Malloy, Secretary of State Denise Merrill, and members of this committee for championing H.B. 5024 and Same Day Registration (SDR) – a proven reform that can substantially increase voter turnout among eligible voters without compromising the integrity of elections or substantially increasing costs.  By enacting H.B. 5024, Connecticut would become the 10th state to permit eligible citizens to both register and vote on Election Day and/or during the early voting period. The District of Columbia has also enacted Same Day Registration.  I will primarily address Section 1 of H.B. 5024, the portion of the legislation that pertains to Same Day Registration. I also offer support for the online voter registration provisions provided for in Section 11 of the bill.

"Testimony Before the Special Joint Committee on Redistricting of the Massachusetts General Court
Although I am very interested in the broad range of issues affecting fairness in representation for Massachusetts communities, I am going to focus my remarks today on the specific issue of incarcerated populations and the manner in which they are counted for purposes of redistricting.  This issue has become increasingly important to the fairness of redistricting around the country, and it is important here in Massachusetts. 
The problem stems from a long-standing flaw in the Census that counts incarcerated people as residents of the district where they are incarcerated rather than in their home district.  Crediting incarcerated people to the census block that contains the prison, rather than to the home community that remains the legal residence of incarcerated persons, results in a significant enhancement of the weight of a vote cast in districts with prisons at the expense of all other residents in all other districts in the state.  It particularly distorts fair representation for communities of color, which are disproportionately affected by high rates of incarceration. 
The rules that the Census Bureau uses for determining ""residence"" were adopted long before prison populations in the U.S. became large enough to have a significant effect on representation.  The U.S. now has some 1.6 million persons in state and federal prisons.  In Massachusetts, the growth of prison population in recent decades has been enormous.   As a percentage of population, Massachusetts now incarcerates three times as many people as it did as recently as 1980, according to data maintained by the Prison Policy Initiative.  And prisons are frequently located in areas geographically and demographically removed from the home communities of incarcerated persons.

"On the problems with legislative proposals that would mandate strict photo identification requirements for voting.
My name is Brenda Wright. I am the Legal Director of the Democracy Program at Dēmos, a nonprofit research and advocacy organization established in 1999. Dēmos works with policy makers, advocates and scholars around the nation to improve our democracy and achieve greater economic equity. I thank the Committee for the opportunity to testify here today.
I personally have worked on issues of voting rights and election reform for the past 18 years. I believe, and Demos believes, that a vibrant American democracy requires high levels of voter turnout and participation in elections. All eligible voters must be encouraged to raise their voices and vote on Election Day without unnecessary barriers that deter participation. The adoption of new, stringent photo ID requirements and proof of citizenship requirements for voting in this Commonwealth, such as are contained in numerous bills before this Committee, would take us away from that goal and would be a step backward for Massachusetts.
Although photo ID and proof of citizenship proposals are offered as necessary to prevent fraud in elections, we know, based on experience and data from other states, that 2 the facts do not warrant these extreme measures, and that all available evidence suggests that voter fraud of the kind that could be prevented by these new requirements is exceedingly rare. Even more importantly, and more disturbingly, these laws would have the effect of preventing many eligible voters from meeting the most fundamental responsibility of citizenship – exercising the right to vote. This will disproportionately affect people who can’t afford the necessary documents, and people who don’t have drivers’ licenses, such as urban residents, communities of color, senior citizens, and disabled citizens.

"The assault on the right to vote witnessed in 2011 is historic in terms of its geographic scope and intensity. Legislation enacted in states across the country to require government-issued photo identification and/or prove citizenship to register to vote, make voter registration more difficult, and curtail early voting is nothing short of blatant vote suppression, the likes of which has not been seen in generations. Absent denial of preclearance by the US Department of Justice in three states, stringent voter identification requirements will restrict voter participation in the upcoming presidential election in Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Texas, South Carolina, and Wisconsin, The list may yet expand as dozens of other states revisit strict voter ID legislation introduced this year in the 2012 legislative sessions. Voter identification initiatives may also be put on the ballot in Minnesota and Missouri.

These laws require that every voter present government-issued photo identification in order to cast a ballot.  And while courts have upheld the restrictions enacted in Georgia and Indiana, other states have now enacted photo ID provisions that exceed those that survived judicial scrutiny.  Voters in Georgia must show a driver’s license, which need not be current, a photo ID from any entity of the US or state governments, a passport, a military ID, or tribal identification.  Acceptable proof of identity includes student identification from state institutions of higher learning. Indiana requires voters to present a photo ID issued by the federal or state government, including student ID from a state school.
But Wisconsin will only accept identification issued by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation, a military ID, passport, naturalization papers or tribal identification.  Student identification is effectively disallowed. And Texas only allows a driver's license, personal ID card issued by the state, military ID, passport or concealed handgun permit. Student identification cards were explicitly rejected by Texas lawmakers.
The vote suppressive impact of these measures is well documented. Indeed, the research demonstrating that students, African Americans, Latinos, young people, low-income Americans, the elderly and persons with disabilities are more likely to be blocked from voting as a result of such requirements has only been building over the last several years.  A disproportionate number of these Americans do not have the type of ID these laws require. For example, 18 percent of Americans over the age of 65, one- quarter of African-Americans, and 15 percent of low-income voters do not have a photo ID. Many young voters do not have a driver’s license, the most commonly accepted form of photo ID.
According to scholars, white voters are approximately 10 percent more likely to have driver’s licenses than non-whites.  Latinos, Asian Americans, African Americans, and naturalized citizens are statistically less likely to have access to five out of six other basic types of acceptable voter identification, as compared to whites and the native born. Asians and Blacks are over 20 percent less likely to have two forms of identification, as compared to whites, while Latinos are 13 percent less likely. A recent report from the Center for American Progress Action Fund shows that voter ID bills would lower Latino voter turnout by as much as 10 percent.

"This week, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand released an ambitious proposal to bring democracy dollars to federal elections. Gillibrand’s “Clean Elections” plan would give eligible voters $200 to donate in each federal race: House of Representatives, Senate, and President. Candidates are eligible to receive these democracy dollars if they agree not to accept any donations over $200. The idea comes from Seattle’s successful democracy vouchers program, which in its first election cycle tripled the number of small donors to municipal races and increased the racial, gender, and socioeconomic diversity of donors in the city. 
Democracy dollars promise to take the power in our democracy back from the wealthy, white, mostly male donor class that has for too long fueled our elections and to elevate the voices of those who are all too often absent from our democracy – people of color, women, low-income people, and young people. Reforms like the one Gillibrand has proposed help to address the racial and economic injustices that have historically plagued our democracy and move us toward greater political equality. 
Demos has worked for years to get money out of politics and make our democracy more racially equitable through reforming our broken campaign finance system. Here are just a few highlights, for those looking to learn more about solutions to the problem of big money in politics after Senator Gillibrand’s announcement:
While a federal solution is desperately needed, many states and localities are leading the way on making our campaign finance system more accountable and our democracy more reflective of the people who make up our diverse communities. Demos is currently supporting our partners at Olé New Mexico and the entire Burque Bucks coalition to bring democracy dollars to the city of Albuquerque. The City of Austin, TX, is also considering adopting a democracy dollars model. 
People across the country understand our campaign finance system is broken and rightly see public financing of elections as one of the most powerful ways to address this crisis in our democracy. Democracy dollars are one of the most equitable strategies for doing so. Demos will continue our work supporting grassroots organizations who are leading the fight across the country to achieve a truly inclusive democracy. ",blog
"The Shelby decision highlights the importance of acknowledging histories of discrimination and centering the communities that have been most impacted.
Voter suppression and intimidation has increased dramatically since June 25, 2013, the day 6 years ago when the Supreme Court decision Shelby v. Holder gutted the 1965 Voting Rights Act (VRA). In Shelby, the Court undercut one of the VRA’s most important provisions: the requirement that states with a history of discrimination in voting seek preclearance before making changes to election law. For nearly 50 years, the VRA prohibited the de jure and de facto barriers that once kept millions of voters from casting ballots, including literacy tests and poll taxes, as well as more overt exclusionary tactics like violence and intimidation. In the absence of such obstruction, and for the first time in American history, African American men and women freely exercised their right to vote. Over time, representation among African Americans and other communities of color in Congress and in state and local elected leadership grew significantly. The VRA opened new pathways to political power-building in all communities of color, and it has in turn moved us closer to a reflective, inclusive democracy.
Today, there is legislation sitting in Congress, the Voting Rights Advancement Act, that would restore and strengthen the protections of the VRA. And earlier this year the House passed a sweeping elections reform bill, the For the People Act, which would also remedy the problems created by the Shelby decision and do a great deal more to promote ballot access and fair representation. Both pieces of legislation would make significant and valuable improvements to the way we conduct elections and practice democracy in our country. Both deserve to be debated and voted on in both houses of Congress. However, neither alone—or even together—will solve all the problems facing our democracy, nor will they guarantee a democracy in which all people, regardless of the color of our skin, our income, our age or ability, are able to be active participants in the political process.
The Inclusive Democracy Project (IDP) is a majority-person of color cohort of powerful state-based leaders who organize working-class communities and communities of color, and advance bold campaigns in 15 states across the U.S. 
As Demos and allies work to protect and strengthen our democracy, the Shelby decision highlights the importance of acknowledging histories of discrimination and centering the communities that have been most impacted. Indeed, this is one reason Demos partners with grassroots organizations through the Inclusive Democracy Project (IDP). IDP is a majority-person of color cohort of powerful state-based leaders who organize working-class communities and communities of color, and advance bold campaigns in 15 states across the U.S. Whether fighting for rights restoration for returning citizens in Florida or public financing of elections in Washington, D.C., IDP partners elucidate the relationship between structural inequality and civic participation.
We’re developing our inclusive democracy agenda alongside members of Demos’ Inclusive Democracy Project, leaders and communities of color who are building power and investing in ideas that can create an inclusive democracy.
As we fight the latest efforts to suppress the vote unleashed by the Shelby decision and work to expand voting rights, our partners inspire us to go further and imagine what it would take to build a truly inclusive democracy. We must envision—and work toward—a democracy agenda that reflects and responds to all the diverse communities who call the United States home.
Demos is therefore developing an Inclusive Democracy Agenda in conversation with IDP partners: a set of policies that, while ambitious, represent steps we must take if we are to live up to our ideals as a democratic society and make it possible for all people to not just survive, but thrive in our democracy. In doing so, Demos is following the leadership of those who understand better than anyone the stakes—communities of color who have been excluded from democracy since the founding of the United States and, as a result of their proximity to the problem, have done the most creative thinking about the solutions. We’re developing our inclusive democracy agenda alongside members of Demos’ Inclusive Democracy Project, leaders and communities of color who are building power and investing in ideas that can create an inclusive democracy.
Establishing an inclusive democracy requires bold, transformative changes to our voting processes and electoral systems.
Establishing an inclusive democracy requires bold, transformative changes to our voting processes and electoral systems. For example, why stop at re-enfranchising people upon completion of a felony conviction, when our values demand that all people of age have the inalienable right to vote, regardless of incarceration status or conviction history? In an inclusive democracy, the right to vote is real for all people, independent of any involvement with the criminal (in)justice system.
Further, creating an inclusive democracy requires thinking beyond the formal political rules of voting and elections to the very institutions of governance and participation themselves, which too often serve to keep people from meaningful democratic engagement and control. It demands creating cultures that promote and structures that facilitate co-governance between elected officials and the communities they represent, including direct lines of communication, two-way accountability, and the guarantee that the will of the people will not be subverted by unaccountable lawmakers or unelected decision-makers. And it demands creative thinking about how to democratize other areas of our lives, from the workplace and the environment to the goods and resources we consume on a daily basis.",blog

On this Labor Day, we celebrate workers and recognize the accomplishments of the U.S. labor movement.
Over a century ago in the First Gilded Age, it was the rise of organized labor that forced powerful new mega-corporations and the concentrated wealth and political power at the top to reckon with ideals of equality and democracy—helping pave the way for the wages, labor rights, worker protections, and social safety net that provided a measure of stability and freedom for so many communities.
Until recently, these advances largely excluded women and communities of color. Yet even as contemporary campaigns like Fight for $15 champion the women and people of color who dominate the lowest-paid jobs, extreme corporate practices and public policies continue to distort our economy into an engine that efficiently produces exclusion, inequality and insecurity.
We at Demos are thinking today of those workers who don’t get this holiday weekend off, those whose previous generations have been barred from the protections and supports of the social contract, and those whose activism and organizing today is finally bringing this country closer to its ideals.
The vision and power of working families has shown us throughout our history that the ills of our economy don’t just happen; they are created by actors who benefit from the inequality. But history has also demonstrated that “we the people” have the tools to change our economy, through the power of organized workers, united in an inclusive labor movement.
Be clear on who is working class
Too often commentators and politicians talk about the “working class” by evoking a narrow, outmoded archetype: a white man laboring in a factory. But today’s working class is much more complex and diverse.
Establish a public credit registry
Job seekers can be denied work based on credit histories which are themselves the product of a system steeped in decades of structural racism. Here's a practical solution.
Pass state-level policy agendas that improve our economy and our democracy
With national politics tangled in scandal and stalemate, we put forward 26 race-forward, populist policies states can advance now.
Here's an achievable federal agenda that advances equity, inclusion, and economic opportunity for all working people.
Labor Day should be more than a pause to honor the past. Our democracy and our economic security—today and tomorrow—is tied to the vibrancy of the labor movement. Let’s take a moment to recognize our labor history and rededicate ourselves to a more just future for all workers.
A key challenge workers face is the constant drain of often-hidden practices that extract money from their pockets—and the lack of bargaining power to challenge those practices.
Last year, Demos was proud to bring our research to support the largest hotel strike in U.S. history, partnering with Marriott workers to push back on predatory lending practices that the company imposed on its own predominantly Black and Latino workforce.",blog
"The NVRA aims to reduce barriers to voter registration, which too often prevent eligible people from participating in the democratic process. 
Twenty-six years ago today, President Clinton signed into law the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) of 1993, the second piece of legislation he signed after winning the presidency in 1992. The NVRA aims to reduce barriers to voter registration, which too often prevent eligible people from participating in the democratic process. Its central provisions require states to provide convenient voter registration opportunities when people interact with government agencies, accept registration applications through the mail, and limit overly aggressive voter purges.
The NVRA is often referred to as the “Motor Voter Act,” because it requires that states provide voter registration during drivers’ license transactions. But it also plays a crucial role in providing voter registration opportunities during transactions at state public assistance and disability offices, to reach persons who are less likely to interact with motor vehicle offices.
We have been privileged to work on increasing the impact of the NVRA, from its infancy through today. Over the years, several states have gone to court seeking to resist implementation of the Act’s voter registration requirements. Having worked on the NVRA since its passage, Brenda (one of our co-authors) argued one of the early cases, from Mississippi, in the United States Supreme Court in 1996 (we’re glad to say that the good guys won). Demos and other partners have continued to monitor how states are doing in providing the voter registration services the NVRA requires, and we pursue advocacy and litigation in many states that have lagged in the numbers of voter registrations collected through public assistance agencies. Last year, we released a report marking the 25th anniversary of the NVRA and summarizing the impact of enforcement efforts. This work across nearly 2 dozen states has resulted in over 3 million new voter registration applications through public assistance agencies covered by the NVRA. And the numbers continue to grow every month.
Ohio, where Demos filed the first of its lawsuits in 2006, provides a particularly dramatic example of how improved implementation of the NVRA increases voter registration through public assistance agencies. Ohio’s agencies were collecting fewer than 1,600 applications per month before we intervened, compared to 13,000 per month since the intervention—a more than 700 percent increase that has resulted in over 800,000 additional voter registrations. 
The NVRA’s requirements for voter registration services through drivers’ license agencies are also a powerful tool to increase registration, when properly implemented. These “Motor Voter” requirements have helped smooth the way for Automatic Voter Registration (AVR), the next logical step in lowering the barriers to full registration and voting. AVR makes voter registration automatic for eligible persons, unless the person affirmatively opts out of registering to vote. Oregon, the first state to enact AVR, had the greatest increase in voter turnout of any state in 2016.
During the past year, Demos, along with other partners, has pursued compliance efforts to improve agency-based registration in Arizona, California, Missouri, Nevada, North Carolina, and South Carolina, illustrating the importance of ongoing vigilance to ensure that we achieve the full promise of the NVRA. 
Although the NVRA, signed on this day in 1993, may not be as well-known as the Voting Rights Act of 1965, its critical role in increasing access to voter registration deserves celebration. Happy birthday, NVRA!",blog
"Over the weekend I read Lane Kenworthy’s Social Democratic America, a fantastic book that touches on a broad range of material in an academic, but brisk and readable fashion. It also has an extensive bibliography for anyone who wants to dig deeper into the issues he discusses. I want to dig into one objection that Kenworthy subtly misunderstands: how racial heterogeneity could hamper social social democracy.
Throughout the book, Kenworthy dismisses the importance of racial homogeneity in the Nordic countries which he frequently cites as examples of successful social democracies. In his recent Foreign Affairs article he writes,
Some observers, even many on the left, worry about the applicability of Nordic-style policies -- which have succeeded in the context of small, relatively homogeneous countries -- to a large, diverse nation such as the United States. Yet moving toward social democracy in the United States would mostly mean asking the federal government to do more of what it already does. It would not require shifting to a qualitatively different social contract.
Before diving into the implications for the U.S., it’s worth noting that racial animosity is already threatening social democracy in Nordic countries. Reuters reports that,
Consensus around the post-war Nordic model of high taxes and generous welfare was long sustained by a homogenous society. But immigration, global competition and fear for jobs have put that ideal of equality based on civic trust under strain… Rising immigration has been coupled with economic troubles that have seen iconic Nordic companies such as Ericsson and Nokia shed jobs. Worries about the affordability of welfare have put the once taboo subject of immigration high on the agenda.
The Economist reports that,
High immigration is threatening the principle of redistribution that is at the heart of the welfare state. Income inequalities in the Nordic countries are generally lower than elsewhere… but Matz Dahlberg, of Uppsala University, reckons that immigration is making people less willing to support redistribution.
All of this is worrying if you believe, as Kenworthy does, that social democracy is inevitable. Last week I noted how increasing inequality tears at the social fabric and causes a decline in support for universalistic welfare programs. But as the Nordic countries shows, there’s another factor at work, and our newest fellow Ian Haney Lopez has a book about it: dog-whistle politics. Lopez’s book is specific to America, and traces dog-whistle politics from Wallace, through Goldwater and Nixon to its apotheosis with Reagan. Lopez shows how racial prejudice undermines universalistic welfare programs. Here’s a short excerpt showing how the right, particularly Reagan, used racial prejudice to attack poverty:
Reagan also trumpeted his racial appeals in blasts against welfare cheats. On the stump, Reagan repeatedly invoked a story of a “Chicago welfare queen” with “eighty names, thirty addresses, [and] twelve Social Security cards [who] is collecting veteran’s benefits on four non-existing deceased husbands… Beyond propagating the stereotypical image of a lazy, larcenous black woman ripping off society’s generosity without remorse, Reagan also implied another stereotype, this one about whites: they were the workers, the taxpayers, the persons playing by the rules and struggling to make ends meet while brazen minorities partied with their hard-earned tax dollars.
Here we see the trick to undermining any universalistic program: creating an “us against them” narrative. The program thereby loses its universality and therefore its support. That being said, to a casual observer, and particularly a white one, this narrative may seem like a weak collection of anecdotes, rather than a trend. But as Republican political consultant Lee Atwater famously admitted,
You start out in 1954 by saying, ""N-, n-, n-."" By 1968, you can't say ""n-"" — that hurts you. Backfires. So you say stuff like forced busing, states' rights and all that stuff. You're getting so abstract now [that] you're talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you're talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is [that] blacks get hurt worse than whites. And subconsciously maybe that is part of it. I'm not saying that. But I'm saying that if it is getting that abstract, and that coded, that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or the other. You follow me — because obviously sitting around saying, ""We want to cut this,"" is much more abstract than even the busing thing, and a hell of a lot more abstract than ""N-, n-.""
He actually admitted that. But politicians and strategists don’t talk that way anymore (for the most part; see below). So the the second objection to this narrative is that it’s not nice to throw out the race card. “The Republicans aren’t racists,” we’re told, “so don’t bring it up.” And most aren’t. They are not “racist” in the vein of late-Wallace or Lott or Thurmond. Rather, they refuse to acknowledge the structural racism in our society. They don’t notice the fact that the mainstream media shows poor blacks when it talks about welfare cheats and poor whites when they talk about the “working poor.” They don’t know that all of those great New Deal programs were designed to keep out blacks.
I noted in my last post how our belief in a “just world,” causes us to impute negative qualities on the poor. Our history is not one that is particularly just. From exterminating the native population to enslaving another to colonization and neo-colonialism we have failed to uphold our values. But instead of critically examining our past and how it shapes our future, we make excuses. Frances Fox Piven explains how that works in a segregated society:
When a racial group is kept at the bottom of the labor system and excluded from its social and political and political institutes, the result may be to create, or at least to nourish, the racist popular culture that is then said to be the cause of labor market and political discrimination.
That is why this melding of race and poverty is one of the most sadly durable memes in U.S. politics. It cropped up numerous times in the 2012 campaign, and has been expanded to include other out-groups, such as Hispanics (implications that “illegal immigrants” take from the welfare system).  As Lopez told me in our interview, “Dog-whistle politics is not fundamentally about race. It’s fundamentally about attacking liberal government, attacking New Deal government, which is good for the country as a whole, but bad in the perception of some of the very rich.”
There is also empirical support for Lopez’s thesis. A 2005 study by Woojin Lee, John Roemer and Karine van der Straeten finds that, “the conservative economic agenda has been given new life because of racist and xenophobic views of polities.” In the UK, France, and Denmark they find a similar trend, but the effect is not as strong.
Kenworthy’s book is valuable, if for no other reason, it explodes an argument recently put forward by Kevin Williamson in The National Review that, “the fact is that as a practical matter we are running out of ways to spend money on the needy.” If Williamson truly believes this, Kenworthy will serve as an antidote. But creating social democracy will not be easy, nor should it be considered inevitable.
Kenworthy’s proposals will require the government to take in more than 10 percent of GDP in increased revenues; not an easy task in the current political climate. The past two years have brought vicious attacks on some of the most important (and successful) parts of our weak social democracy, often in the guise of racially-charged language. It’s unlikely those will abate in the future. Nevertheless, Kenworthy shows that it can be done, if we just get the political will to do it.",blog
"You would need to hold over seven million dollars to be one of the top one percent wealthiest Americans in 2013.
Yesterday, a Pew post, also picked up by Ezra Klein, was making the rounds claiming that it would take around $2.5 million to enter the top one percent of wealth holders. The post used the Census' Survey of Income and Program Participation, an excellent way of understanding poverty.
Here's how Pew summarized the Census findings:
In August, the Census Bureau released detailed wealth tabulations that imply that the minimum wealth level needed to qualify for the wealthiest 1% of American households increased from $2.3 million in 2009 to $2.4 million in 2011. That in itself indicates there were wealth gains at the very top of the wealth distribution.  On the other hand, the minimum wealth level needed to be in the wealthiest 4% of households fell from 2009 to 2011, from which one infers that wealth declined for households at the wealthiest 4% level.
The overall story is borne out by every survey: the top 1% wealthiest Americans have been adding to their net worth every single year. But the $2.4 million number Pew cites is far too low, because the Census doesn't adequately capture what's happening at the top.
More accurate surveys show a lot more concentrated wealth. The Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances, a demographic and economic survey based on interviews with over 4,000 families, is a better way to gauge wealth. Why? Among surveys, it's the most thorough way to look at the composition and distribution of the country's wealth, particularly those of high net worth.
Here were their findings, based on a 2013 survey: 
So the more accurate threshold to enter the rarefied top 1% of wealthholders, $7,880,400, is almost three times as high as the Census estimates. ",blog
"This piece originally appeared on FRAC's website.
August 6 marks the anniversary of the enactment of the 1965 Voting Rights Act (VRA), a triumph of the Civil Rights era that prohibits racial discrimination in voting. Now in its 54th year, the efficacy of the Act is in peril.
Shelby County v. Holder opened the floodgates for the enactment of more laws and policies that make it harder for people to vote.
The 2013 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Shelby County v. Holder paved the way for states to adopt rules that suppress registration and voting. The Court invalidated the part of the VRA requiring certain states and local jurisdictions to obtain pre-approval from the U.S. Department of Justice or a federal court before making changes to their voting laws. That decision opened the floodgates for the enactment of more laws and policies that make it harder for people — particularly people of color and low-income people — to vote.
Ongoing efforts aimed at suppressing the vote include overly strict photo identification requirements, restrictions on early voting and absentee voting, the purging of voter rolls, and voter registration modifications. While these suppression tactics are not always as overt as some specifically outlawed by the VRA, such as poll taxes and literacy tests, the result is often the same — the purposeful disenfranchisement of people of color.
Since the passage of the VRA and other federal efforts it inspired, including the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) and other key legislation, substantial progress has been made in preventing discriminatory policies and practices and making voting more accessible. These improvements, however, have not washed away the legacy of disenfranchisement, nor prevented current voter suppression attempts.
And it’s not just voting rights advocates who can help make the promise of the VRA and the NVRA real. Everyone has a role to play in protecting the right to vote. One place anti-hunger and health care access stakeholders can take action is by connecting eligible low-income people to the opportunity to register to vote at state public assistance agencies.  Demos and FRAC’s primer on the National Voter Registration Act provides important guidance on how this critical federal law can help millions of low-income people register to vote through state public assistance agencies, and how anti-hunger advocates can be part of this important endeavor.
More work is necessary to connect tens of millions of eligible voters of all incomes, races, and ethnicities to opportunities to vote, and with the looming 2020 presidential election, 34 Senate races, 435 House races, and thousands of state and local races, there is no better time to start than now.

"Today, Senator Elizabeth Warren unveiled an ambitious plan to make college tuition-free, expand Pell Grants for low-income students, and cancel student loan debt for most borrowers. It is the first plan of the 2020 election cycle that comprehensively addresses both college affordability and student loan debt simultaneously. It also marks the first time that mass student debt cancellation has been proposed as a serious, presidential campaign-level topic.
It is effectively a guarantee of tuition-free college for everyone and a guarantee of debt-free college for low-income students.
The contours of Senator Warren’s plan are as follows: A guarantee of tuition-free public college, at two- or four-year schools for everyone, with a massive expansion of Pell Grants to help low-income and middle-class students pay for living costs and other expenses that make up the majority of borrowing. Thus, it is effectively a guarantee of tuition-free college for everyone and a guarantee of debt-free college for low-income students. The plan would also cancel up to $50,000 in student loan debt for families making under $100,000 annually, with a sliding scale of forgiveness for those making between $100,000 - $250,000.
This upends a debate that has circulated in progressive circles over the past several years, between those who favor a universal flat benefit of tuition-free college, and those who prefer a guarantee of debt-free college for everyone by covering unmet financial need for low- and middle-income students.
This plan does both. By expanding eligibility for Pell Grants, and potentially increasing awards to the level that they cover most non-tuition costs, it offers a pathway to college without any debt for those who are currently most likely to borrow and struggle to repay their loans. It links the simplicity of tuition-free college with the progressivity (and concern about non-tuition costs) that debt-free college advocates endorse. It expands funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities who, due to centuries of structural racism, do not have the same resources as predominately white institutions.
And indeed, the dramatic rise in student loan debt has placed unacceptable risk on working class families and on people of color, who must take on more debt for the same degree as white students and often need to gain several levels of education just to maintain a foothold in the middle class. 
Despite the federal government trying to make student debt payments more manageable (by creating repayment plans that align borrowers’ monthly payments with their income), the percentage of student loans that are 90 or more days delinquent has remained essentially unchanged since 2012, even as unemployment has fallen and the economy has generally improved. Default rates are appallingly high on student debt, particularly among black borrowers. And borrowers of color find it basically impossible to chip away at both the principal and interest on their debt.
Rather than fixing loan repayment, actually cancelling a portion of everyone’s debt – Warren proposes forgiving $50,000 of debt for families making under $100,000 a year, with a sliding scale of forgiveness for wealthier families – could substantially address the racial disparities inherent in student loan borrowing. Black borrowers are overrepresented among those who have large debt. 12 years after beginning college, black borrowers make up under 8% of those with no debt, but over a quarter (27.5%) of those who hold over $50,000.
There are large populations who have attempted college for whom it did not pay off. Among families receiving means-tested assistance (including SNAP, housing assistance, TANF, Medicaid, or SSI), 11.6% had a bachelor’s degree or higher, and additional 31.8% had at least some college.
This shift in the policy conversation is striking. For many years, the policy consensus around addressing student loan debt centered on making the debt easier to repay, targeting forgiveness at those who had been harmed by bad actors, preventing those bad actors from accessing federal loan dollars, and holding loan servicers accountable. All of these were and are noble goals, but all of them were predicated on the notion that student debt problem is a consumer protection problem, that student debt was fundamentally “good debt,” and that as long as higher education resulted in greater earnings than high school, debt was justified for most. We also continue to justify student debt on the assumption that America suffers only from a college completion crisis, despite the fact that over 20% of Black bachelor’s degree recipients default on their loans.
The new conversation, which Senator Warren’s policy has helped jumpstart, is based on a deeper question about whether it is either moral or efficient to force people into borrowing massive amounts of money for an education – particularly an undergraduate education, and more particularly an undergraduate education at a public 2- or 4-year college. It also asks: What do we do when one of our social safety net programs (in this case, federal student loans) turns out to cause disproportionate and extensive harm to certain communities? Should we continue to make the program simpler and fairer, or should we essentially start from scratch?
There are important details to work out. Ensuring states continue to reinvest in public higher education is crucial, as is finding the right level of investment that states can maintain given competing priorities. It’s also important to create a tuition-free, or debt-free, policy that survives a recession when state budgets are squeezed and demand for education rises. We should ensure that Pell Grants meaningfully address the rising cost of non-college expenses, from housing to childcare. We should also work to address inequity within public higher education, not only by reducing the financial burden of attending, but by making sure selective public colleges are available to all students and not just a wealthy, white few. And since this plan would not eliminate all debt – there are still some middle-income families, for example, who have over $50,000 in debt – we should think about how to address repayment and other mechanisms for the borrowers who remain. Finally, we should think about how our safety net addresses those who have recently paid off student debt but still may be struggling financially.
But it is refreshing to see student debt cancellation being taken seriously, and that policies to address future student populations are also taking a look at the consequence of policies that treat higher education solely as a private good. It’s also important to recognize that many people struggling with student loan debt did nothing but follow their dreams and educational aspirations, and that many of them should just be given a chance to move on with their lives.",blog
"The question would effectively deter 6.5 million people – overwhelmingly from historically undercounted communities – from participating in the 2020 Census.
On Tuesday, April 23, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments on the addition of a controversial citizenship question to the 2020 Census.
Ignoring the recommendations of the Census Bureau’s own professionals, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross forced the Bureau last year to add an untested citizenship question, which would ask every household to report which of its members are U.S. citizens. If included, analysts predict the question would effectively deter 6.5 million people – overwhelmingly from historically undercounted communities – from participating in the 2020 Census. A coalition of civil rights groups, states, cities and counties across the country are challenging the Trump administration’s push to include this controversial question on the basis that it violates federal law and the Constitution.  
The Constitution clearly mandates that every 10 years, the government must count every person living in the United States – regardless of background or citizenship status. Collecting accurate Census data is vital to determining political representation in Congress, drawing electoral districts for state and local offices, and determining where limited-English speaking voters can access translated voting materials and bilingual poll workers. Census data are also used in allocating more than $800 billion in federal funding to states for necessary resources, such as roads and highways, public schools, community clinics and hospitals, Medicare, SNAP, and affordable housing programs, among others.  
But in a political climate where immigrants and people of color already face deep uncertainty and fear for their well-being, people are afraid to disclose their immigration status. Including a citizenship question would undoubtedly impede Census participation in their households – leading to an undercount of immigrants and people of color, who deserve accurate representation in Congress and access to high-quality public resources and programs.    
It is clear that by including a citizenship question, this administration is unfairly trying to reduce the representation of communities of color in Congress and instill fear among vulnerable and historically under-counted communities, who already face systemic barriers to full participation in our democracy.  Three different federal courts – in California, Maryland, and New York – have now struck down as unlawful Secretary Ross’s decision to add this unnecessary and untested question to the 2020 Census. Demos, along with dozens of other civil rights and voting rights advocates, joined an amicus brief urging the Supreme Court to do the same.
We must understand that the upcoming battle before the Supreme Court is part of a much larger fight for racial and economic justice – both of which are vital to building a multi-racial, inclusive democracy. The end result of including a citizenship question is evident: We risk silencing 6.5 million voices that should be counted and heard in 2020 – and the years to come. As the Leadership Conference has powerfully noted:
“The Census is our nation’s largest, most complex peacetime undertaking and is a cornerstone of our democracy. Secretary Ross, President Trump, and their defenders are betting that by disrupting the census, they can change who counts on the biggest decisions of all. We can’t let this happen.”",blog
"We hope to create a space for our peers, experts, organizers, and activists to discuss the most pressing issues we’re facing.
Our democracy has been in shambles since its inception and the voices of marginalized people have historically and continue to be ignored in favor of those with money and power. From voter suppression at the polls to disparities in healthcare, access to quality education, and mass incarceration of people of color—the political system is designed to disenfranchise black and brown people. More than ever before, movements like Black Lives Matter and Color of Change have been formed across the country and led by young people of color who are outraged by our failing democracy.
Those very real sentiments of outrage—and sometimes despair—our peers often protest about in group chats, over happy hour drinks, and family dinner discussions, is what inspired the creation of “Keep That Same Energy”—a multi-faceted series of conversations hosted by Demos, designed to mobilize and motivate millennials of color to be civically engaged beyond voting and present ways to own our power and make changes in our communities. 
The Keep That Same Energy series was purposefully formed to create an open and safe space for black and brown millennials to discuss the significance of defining, building and maintaining power in our communities, and how we can ensure to “keep that same energy” in our approach to political engagement. This series was born out of the deep understanding that policies around issues like education, climate, and voting rights—which all directly impact communities of color—should be primarily informed by the people most affected. 
There are growing frustrations among young people of color who often feel locked out of the conversations around issues that detrimentally impact us, our friends, and family members. We don’t know who to turn to for the answers to our burning questions and frustrations. As millennials ourselves who are engaged in policy and social justice activism, we hope to create that space for our peers, along with experts, organizers, and activists to discuss the most pressing issues we’re facing and strategize ways to engage and build the power that already exists within ourselves and our various communities.

"Last week on CNN’s “Town Hall,” the issue of restoring the right to vote to current and formerly incarcerated people was put to the 2020 candidates, eliciting a range of responses from Democratic hopefuls. The question to Senator Bernie Sanders was framed in particularly stark terms: “Do you support giving convicted terrorists and sex offenders the right to vote?” 
The Senator’s answer was simple: yes. He argued that this issue is ultimately about the strength of our democracy, and that once you begin to pick and choose who loses the right to vote, you are headed down a slippery slope where an inviolable right can become an arbitrary one. 
This was a powerful answer, but it doesn’t tell the whole story. The full truth, which has been well researched and documented, is that in the wake of Reconstruction states around the Union hurried to create laws to suppress newly emancipated black voters. One of the tools employed to achieve this goal was prosecution and incarceration, which would indirectly but permanently deprive individuals of the right to vote. Disenfranchisement laws were modified to ensure that they would most impact African Americans, who were regularly arrested for low-level crimes. The justice system would be deployed against people of color, would-be-voters would be imprisoned, and political power would remain concentrated in the hands of white men. 
Disenfranchisement laws were modified to ensure that they would most impact African Americans, who were regularly arrested for low-level crimes. 
In Mississippi, the state constitution was amended to disenfranchise those who commit burglary but not murder. In the words of the state’s high court, the purpose was to “obstruct the exercise of the franchise by the negro race.” 
In 1876, Virginia enacted a constitutional amendment to disenfranchise voters for petit larceny. An opponent who spoke out against the bill stated that black people were more likely to steal out of hunger and more likely to be convicted because of biased police and judges. The amendment passed. 
These laws were by no means limited to the South. In 1874, New York finally dropped a property ownership requirement that applied to black voters only, but at the same time amended its constitution to require disenfranchisement for any “infamous crime” in an effort to suppress the black vote. In the 2019 New York State legislative session, legislation has been introduced to restore the vote to individuals on parole. More and more states are acknowledging the problematic origins of these laws and the need to rectify racist policy. But in New York, even this first step has been met with opposition and claims that restoring the vote will harm public safety. 
Overall, the marrying of criminal justice and voter suppression has had devastating consequences. Today, over 2 million people are incarcerated, the majority of whom are people of color. Research and data have shown that people of color are overpoliced and are more likely to face prosecution, conviction, and incarceration than whites for the same behavior. Black drivers are twice as likely as whites to be pulled over and four times as likely to be searched but are less likely to be found with contraband. 
In addition, the increased use of plea bargaining, the process through which prosecutors offer reduced sentences to defendants in exchange for pleading guilty and forgoing the right to a trial, has created more opportunities for bias in our system. The rate of plea bargains began to climb after the Civil War and rose steadily until plea bargaining came to dominate our criminal justice system. The circumstances under which people accept pleas vary state by state, but prosecutors set the terms and often defendants are unable to see the evidence against them before making a decision that will change the course of their lives. Here too, evidence of racial bias is consistent. Black defendants are less likely to be offered reduced charges, and they get sentences that are almost 20 percent longer for the same crimes when controlling for age and criminal history. 
The question posed to Sanders on Tuesday harkened back to the not-so-distant past where our overly punitive and discriminatory approach to criminal justice was supported by those on the right and left. The responses from the candidates also pointed to the uncertainty of our current moment. Candidates are being pushed to be explicit about their positions on issues like the restoration of the right to vote and reparations, both issues in which race plays a central role. Critics of giving people who are incarcerated the vote have tried to make the Boston Marathon bomber and Dylann Roof the poster children for the issue. This is a 1980s and 1990s style fear tactic. It demonizes everyone in prison rather than considering what it would take to reintegrate them into society. It paints with a broad and misleading brush a diverse population caught in a system that is itself deeply biased. This does little justice to either the debate or to the individuals impacted by the system. 
Having the discussion on these terms also side-steps any acknowledgment of human rights abuses in prison, such as the horrific conditions documented in the Justice Department’s recent report about Alabama’s prison conditions, and practices such as solitary confinement, which many consider tantamount to torture. 
Ultimately, instead of reducing the issue of voting in prison to frightening imagines and incendiary talking points, we should be asking the more fundamental question: What will it take to build a democracy in which all voices are heard? ",blog
"Today marks the 54th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA), the most effective racial justice statute passed in American history. 
The VRA should not have been necessary. The Fifteenth Amendment, which was ratified in 1870, prohibits discrimination in voting based on race. It boldly proclaims, “The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.” Also in 1870, Mississippi elected the nation’s first Black senator, Hiram Rhodes Revels, and South Carolina elected its first Black congressperson, Joseph Rainey. According to historian Eric Foner, during Reconstruction about 2,000 Black men held an official position in government. 
When political compromise brought a premature end to Reconstruction, however, southern states devised a myriad of ways to disenfranchise Black Americans. Whites regained control of state legislatures and used a combination of poll taxes, literacy tests, residence and property restrictions, white primaries, racial gerrymanders, and racial-terror violence to strip Black people of the vote and destroy their political power. 
It was not until Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965, at the height of the Black Freedom Struggle, that the Fifteenth Amendment’s promises became real. 
It was not until Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965, at the height of the Black Freedom Struggle, that the Fifteenth Amendment’s promises became real. The VRA prohibits all voting practices and procedures that have the purpose or effect of discriminating based on race. The centerpiece of the bill is Section 5, which requires that states and localities with a history of discriminatory voting practices “preclear” any changes in election procedures with the U.S. Department of Justice or the federal district court in D.C. before implementing those changes. In these preclearance proceedings, the jurisdiction bears the burden of proving that the proposed changes do not have a discriminatory purpose and would not be “retrogressive”—meaning would not diminish the voting strength of voters of color. 
Section 5 is premised on the reality that voter suppression is systemic and difficult to root out. By stopping this discrimination before it starts, the preclearance requirement is affirmatively anti-racist.
The VRA had an immediate impact. The nonwhite (predominantly Black) voter registration rate increased dramatically across the south from 1964 to 1966-67. For example, in Mississippi that measure went from 6.7 percent to 59.8 percent; in Alabama it went from 19.3 percent to 51.6 percent. The VRA even resulted in 20-point bumps in the white voter registration rate in many states. Candidates preferred by Black voters began running and winning in jurisdictions where that would have been unthinkable just years earlier. Slowly, state legislatures and Congress began to look more like America.             
In 2013, the Supreme Court gutted the VRA’s preclearance requirement in Shelby County v. Holder. 
In 2013, the Supreme Court gutted the VRA’s preclearance requirement in Shelby County v. Holder. The 5-4 majority left Section 5 intact, but struck down the VRA’s formula (in Section 4(b) of the Act) for determining which jurisdictions were required to preclear electoral changes. Despite the extensive record gathered by Congress and the 98-0 reauthorization vote in the Senate in 2006, Chief Justice Roberts determined that the coverage formula was based on “decades-old data and eradicated practices,” and concluded that it no longer spoke to “current conditions.” “Today,” he wrote, “our Nation has changed.” The Court therefore struck down the coverage formula on federalism grounds and what Roberts described as “the fundamental principle of equal sovereignty” requiring the federal government to treat states similarly. Since Shelby County, the VRA’s preclearance regime has been out of commission, and procedural changes ranging from new photo ID procedures to discriminatory districting have been allowed to go into effect freely across the previously covered jurisdictions. 
In her dissent in Shelby County, Justice Ginsburg wrote that “[t]hrowing out preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.” She was right—and it has continued storming. 
Two hours after the Supreme Court’s decision, then state Attorney General Greg Abbott announced that Texas should be able to implement a strict voter ID law that a court had blocked under preclearance. The following day, North Carolina pushed a groundbreaking new omnibus voter suppression bill that became known as the “monster” law. Federal courts later found both laws to be intentionally discriminatory against voters of color. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the monster bill targeted Black voters “with almost surgical precision.” 
Responding to intentional, race-based voter suppression requires an energetic democracy movement and fearless litigation. It also requires that we restore the Voting Rights Act to stop discriminatory practices before they go into effect. The Voting Rights Advancement Act, a bill pending in Congress as H.R. 4, would do this by enacting a new coverage formula and mandating that certain practices known to be discriminatory be submitted for preclearance regardless of the jurisdiction seeking to implement them.Discriminatory voter suppression continues at crisis levels. Earlier this year, Demos and our partners sued to stop a voter purge program in Texas, which falsely claimed that almost 100,000 non-citizens were registered to vote and over half had voted, and threatened to kick naturalized citizens—overwhelmingly people of color—off the voting rolls. In 2018, then-Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp presided over his own race for governor against Stacey Abrams, deploying aggressive voter purges and unreasonable signature-matching protocols that disproportionately denied voters of color the ability to cast a ballot.
In 2016 we had the first presidential election since 1965 without the full protections of the Voting Rights Act. We cannot afford another election in which voter suppression is permitted to fester in our states and distort outcomes. We must come together to restore the VRA and build a democracy in which all voters have equal influence in our electoral system. ",blog
"This forthcoming paper makes the case for a new constitutional amendment—a Right-to-Vote Amendment for a 21st Century Democracy
Lawmakers across the country have found ways to lock millions of Americans, particularly Black and brown Americans, out of their voting rights.
The right to vote is among the most fundamental and sacred in American democracy, yet it is still not something every voting-age U.S. citizen can count on. The struggle and sacrifice of generations of brave Americans has brought our society closer to our democratic ideals, and today the Constitution contains more protections for the right to vote than when it was enacted. However, this foundational document—in which we enshrine our most fundamental values and most durable structural change—still does not offer an affirmative, comprehensive guarantee of that right to vote. As a result, lawmakers across the country have found ways to lock millions of Americans, particularly Black and brown Americans, out of their voting rights and, in turn, out of full participation in our democratic society. Voting rights organizers and advocates are again today engaged in creative and courageous efforts to resist voter suppression and other tactics that threaten our democratic ideals, and to make the right to vote real for all eligible Americans. These efforts are complicated, and sometimes thwarted, by the limitations of protections for the right to vote in our laws and, most critically, in our Constitution.
Codifying an affirmative right to vote in the Constitution will ensure every eligible person has full, inalienable access to the franchise.
Our current political moment has brought renewed attention to how the ills baked into American democracy are still being used to strip away the ability of Americans to participate in the political process. It has also brought a heightened appetite for reforms to fix what is broken and realize the promise of democracy for the most racially diverse generation in our history. As we collectively imagine an inclusive democracy and identify the reforms necessary to get us there, we should articulate an affirmative vision of how we could more fully enshrine the right to vote in the Constitution itself. Codifying an affirmative right to vote in the Constitution and amending it to address some of the most egregious failures of the promise of democracy will do more than anything else to realize the unfulfilled promise of democracy and ensure every eligible person has full, inalienable access to the franchise.
This paper lays out the kind of robust constitutional protection for the right to vote that we envision, in the form of a new amendment—a Right-to-Vote Amendment for a 21st Century Democracy—that names how the right to vote has been obstructed over the years and offers concrete remedies to these distortions of our democracy. Such an amendment would:
Promote universal voter registration by constitutionalizing automatic voter registration & same day registration;
Protect against laws that have the effect of denying or diluting the voting rights of historically disenfranchised communities;
Abolish the Electoral College and ensure the President and Vice-President are elected directly by the people; 
Demos’ hope is to stimulate a conversation that goes beyond denouncing the latest form of voter suppression and instead centers the structural and systemic reform necessary to realize the full promise of our democracy.",policy-briefs
"Have you heard?
While Seattle and Maine make progress in getting big money out of elections, Connecticut is poised to undo a signature accomplishment—the Citizens Election Program. Facing budget cuts, some legislators in Connecticut have proposed allowing wealthy donors to, once again, dominate the state’s elections.
Connecticut has had state-wide public financing since 2008. Through financing from the Citizens’ Election Fund, candidates who obtain the required number of small donations can receive a lump sum to fund their campaign.
The program has increased participation, diversified the donor pool, helped more candidates of color run for office, and led to policy outcomes more responsive to the needs of the general public rather than the elite donor class.
We need your help.
The Connecticut House is meeting about this on Friday. Contact your state representatives now and tell them: With more money than ever flowing into our democracy, now is not the time to roll back clean elections in Connecticut.
In our Fresh Start report, Demos profiled how public financing has helped Connecticut by interviewing bipartisan public officials and reviewing the program’s impact on policy, representation, and process. Our findings were clear—once candidates were no longer exclusively dependent on wealthy donors and businesses, the influence of lobbyists decreased, and elected representatives became more responsive to the public will and passed popular legislation such as paid sick leave and a higher minimum wage.
Participation in the Citizens’ Election program is extremely high. In 2012, 77 percent of elected legislators participated in the voluntary program and all current statewide offices are held by public financing participants.
That’s why repeal really makes no sense. Let the legislature know before Friday that this is unacceptable.
Public financing is a fundamental step towards a representative and responsive government. Connecticut shouldn’t abandon it.",blog
"At last week’s four-day long hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Donald Trump’s pick for the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch, refused to answer even the most basic questions about the role of money in our democracy.
Judge Gorsuch has a record of going out of his way to support the wealthy and powerful over every day working people. And, with the potential to be the deciding vote to do away with the few remaining protections against big money influence in our democracy, the stakes could not be higher. Judge Gorsuch would make racial bias in political voice in this country even worse—by further empowering the wealthy, white donor class over the rest of the population. 
The burden was on him to show that he respects core constitutional values like equal justice for all and would protect all of our rights, not just the rights of the wealthy and well connected. Judge Gorsuch did no such thing.
Here’s a round-up of the most egregious moments of the hearing when Judge Gorsuch failed to offer straightforward answers about his views on money in politics.
 
When Senator Whitehouse (RI) asked him, essentially, if Congress had the power to address the possibility that an elite donor class will completely take over our democracy, Judge Gorsuch’s response suggested that Congress can legislate to address bribes to politicians.
But, we know that a total takeover by a political elite would run much deeper, and would be more systemic, than bribes to politicians.
Gorsuch refused to state that millionaire and billionaire spending was pernicious in our democracy.
 
When asked by Senator Leahy (VT) whether someone outright purchasing a vote would qualify as corruption, Gorsuch declined to answer. When pressed further by Leahy, Gorsuch replied, “I’d follow the law…and that would certainly follow within my understanding of the law.”
By refusing to answer even this basic question about vote-buying, Judge Gorusch refused to acknowledge that it’s unfair for the wealthy to have more of say in our democracy than every day Americans.
 
When Senator Leahy asked him about Congress’ role in legislating to limit corruption in the wake of Citizens United, Gorsuch responded by saying, “I think there is lots of room for legislation in this area that the Court has left. The Court indicated that if proof of corruption can be demonstrated that a different result may obtain on expenditure limits….”
Gorsuch’s answer raises serious concerns about his grasp of Citizens United. As Rick Hasen notes, ""Either Judge Gorsuch does not understand the scope of Citizens United and its holding, or he is trying to soften its harshness by wrongly suggesting Congress has room to legislate spending limits.""
Nothing in Judge Gorsuch’s record suggests he would want to soften Citizens United’s blow to our democracy—in fact, he signed on to extend its logic in the Hobby Lobby case. But if Judge Gorsuch believes that legislators or litigants can present evidence of corruption that could justify a spending limit, he should tell us what kind of evidence he has in mind—as Senator Leahy has requested in follow up “questions for the record.”
 
In the Riddle v. Hickenlooper case, the Tenth Circuit struck down a Colorado statute that allowed higher contribution limits for major party candidates than for minor party candidates. In that opinion, Judge Gorsuch went out of his way to write a concurring opinion suggesting that he might join the most conservative Supreme Court justices and afford contribution limits the “strict scrutiny,” the most stringent standard of judicial review used by the courts and highest constitutional protection. The application of strict scrutiny in this instance would be extreme. As Demos counsel Allie Boldt has pointed out, in some instances “the Court has not even afforded the freedom to vote with this level of protection.”
When Senator Klobuchar (MN) asked Gorsuch why he went out of his way to write the concurrence, he simply mansplained the case to her. He refused to say whether he thinks all contribution limits should be subject to strict scrutiny—a radical interpretation that would put him among the ranks of Justices Thomas and Scalia, and that would put many of our remaining campaign finance protections at risk. Judge Gorsuch’s answers also gave no indication whether he would treat a contribution limit or ban that applied differently to corporations than to real people as “discriminatory”—as his vote with the majority in Hobby Lobby warns he might. The system is fundamentally broken when the right to contribute or spend money is protected with more force than the right to vote. That is literally putting money over people.   
 
Senator Whitehouse cited Gorsuch’s own nomination as an example of the role of secret spending to influence political outcomes, and he pressed Trump’s nominee about what he thought of a group spending $10 million to support his nomination.
Not surprisingly, Gorsuch refused to say whether he thinks disclosure is in the public interest, asserting instead that “It would be a politics question and I’m not, with all respect Senator, going to get involved in politics.”
While Gorsuch talked about the importance of protecting speech, he never quite articulated the positive value of disclosure. Nina Totenberg and Rick Hasen posit that Gorsuch seems to the right of Scalia on the issue of disclosure and would side with extremist justices  who refuse to recognize a strong public interest in knowing who seeks to influence our votes.  
 
Ninety-one percent of people who voted for President Trump’s wanted him to appoint someone to the Supreme Court who is open to limiting big money. Gorsuch, simply put, is not up to the job. His record suggests that he will side with big money over working families. Next week, Senators must oppose his nomination to a lifetime appointment on the highest Court.",blog
"Anyone who pays attention to Washington D.C.’s local politics can tell you that the city is long overdue for meaningful campaign finance reform. In the past few months alone, the District has been rattled by multiple scandals involving the flagrant misuse of campaign money by sitting elected officials.
While these and past scandals have attracted much-needed scrutiny to bad choices made by individual officials and candidates, there’s rarely discussion about the underlying political condition that fosters these bad choices. The overarching problem here is the outsized role that big money plays in D.C. (and American) politics—and how that perpetuates inequality.
As community organizer and D.C. resident Lourdes Ashley Hunter of the Trans Women of Color Collective recently put it at a public gathering of democracy activists at the St. Stephen and the Incarnation Church, “what’s important here in Washington, DC…when we’re talking about politics: people who have access to money are the ones who control the politics.”
This leaves communities with less access to wealth, including generational wealth, hugely underrepresented in politics. In D.C., this plays out in the form of gentrification, skyrocketing rents and displacement of people of color—among other crucial problems.
This isn’t just a D.C. phenomenon. In federal, state and local elections across the country, large donors determine who runs for office, who wins elections, and what issues get attention from elected officials. Candidates have to raise large amounts of money from wealthy individuals and corporations in order to have a chance at winning. These big donors and spenders aren’t reflective of the diversity of constituents— they’re more likely to be white and male, and they have starkly different priorities when it comes to core economic issues.
In this big-money system, there’s little to no incentive to cater to the needs of even average voters—and still less incentive to prioritize the needs of communities most marginalized by systems of oppression.
The good news is that across the country more than 27 states, cities, counties and municipalities have significantly curbed the influence of big-money politics by empowering people who can contribute a few dollars but cannot afford to throw down thousands of dollars. The research shows that matching small donations with public funds to increase their impact strengthens democracy. Public financing programs have successfully diversified the gender, racial and class composition of candidates’ donor bases, and have the potential to help Americans of all backgrounds make their voices heard and limit the influence of big money.
Tomorrow, the D.C. Council’s Judiciary Committee will hold a public hearing on the  Fair Elections Act of 2017, which would establish a program for public financing of city elections. The Fair Elections Act would ensure that candidates could afford to run for office by relying on D.C. residents to fund their campaigns, rather turning to wealthy individuals and corporations.
As residents of Washington D.C., we are already deprived of a voice in federal politics. The time for D.C. residents to have a meaningful voice in local elections is long overdue. The Council would be wise to pass this much-needed legislation to reduce the influence of big-money politics and empower local community members. ",blog
"As of today, employers can no longer submit employees or job applicants to credit checks—except in certain restricted circumstances.
After a years-long campaign, The NYC Coalition to Stop Credit Checks in Employment has officially achieved its eponymous goal. As of today, employers can no longer submit employees or job applicants to credit checks—except in certain restricted circumstances.
I’m proud to have been part of the coalition’s leadership during the last year when the victory was finally brought home. I’m even prouder still that my organization and colleagues like Amy Traub have been national thought-leaders on credit checks policy for years.
It’s important to realize that NYC’s law is the nation’s strongest ban on employment credit checks. Of the dozen or so existing statutes around the country, the New York City law is the only law that is crafted and designed with the intent to remedy the racially discriminatory practice of checking a job applicant's credit history.
The integrity of the NYC law—that it is meaningful and will eliminate unnecessary red tape for many positions where a credit check is an arbitrary obstacle to employment, such as frontline retail and restaurant positions—is a testament to the intentional planning and perseverance by the coalition and progressive elected leaders like Brad Lander. 
I became an organizer for moments like today, when we see the evidence of the change we want to make. And I’m now more hopeful that others will take up the mantle and that this practice will be a thing of the past across the nation.",blog
"Washington DC is on the cusp of making a big, systemic change to its local elections.
One that will strengthen local democracy by reining in the influence of big money, empower small donors to participate, and break down barriers for people of color and women to run for office.
DC’s City Council is closer than ever to having publicly-financed political campaigns. A super-majority on the Council introduced the DC Fair Elections Act of 2017 back in March of 2017. The Fair Elections Act would create a voluntary, small-donor matching program for local elections.
Under the program, candidates would agree to take only small donations in exchange for a 5-to-1 match, paid for through a public fund, along with a start-up grant—a cost that amounts to 0.006 percent of the city’s annual budget. The program would be available to candidates running for mayor, attorney general, Council or the DC State Board of Education. More than 27 states, counties and municipalities empower small donors and curb the power of big money in politics through similar programs.
Fair Elections would make DC’s political system more equitable by increasing the racial diversity of those who donate money to local candidates. Currently, DC’s donor class is whiter, wealthier, older and more male than the District’s population. More than 60 percent of campaign contributions come from either individuals who don’t live in DC, or from corporations and PACs, while only 5 percent come from voters giving $100 or less.
In June, the Council hosted a public hearing on fair elections, where the public turned out in large numbers to support the measure.
But the big action came last week. On Wednesday December 13th, the Council Committee on the Judiciary and Public Safety voted 5-0 to move the Fair Elections Act to the full Council for a first vote at the next Council legislative meeting, currently scheduled for January 9th. The second and final vote for approval is expected soon after.
While the bill passed commitee unanimously, there was one small dust-up over policy. Here’s a breakdown of the brief scuffle, courtesy of WAMU: 
The only debate on the bill stemmed from an amendment proposed by Council Member Mary Cheh (D-Ward 3), who said she opposed a program that offers both a lump-sum payment and then matching public funds. She proposed limiting it to matching funds, and at a higher rate of 6 to 1.
But her amendment was roundly opposed, including by Councilmember Vincent Gray (D-Ward 7), who said he worried that not offering a lump-sum payment would have a disproportionate impact on candidates east of the Anacostia River, where incomes and contributions to campaigns are lower.
“For candidates who have low name recognition, I think it’s going to be difficult for them to raise enough matchable donations to make the program viable,” he said.
Gray’s point about the importance of start-up grants is backed up by the facts. Start-up grants are key to the program’s success because they allow candidates without wide name recognition to be more viable. Eliminating these lump-sum payments could reduce participation, a key metric of program success. Candidates who need the start-up grants to raise enough to compete would be deterred from participation.
As important, his concern that the proposed amendment would undermine candidates “east of the Anacostia River, where incomes and contributions to campaigns are lower” speaks to a theme of racial equity that has been central to fair elections supporters.
In late November, the DC Fair Elections Coalition convened a town hall meeting on fair elections in precisly the area of the city that Gray referenced and represents, southeast DC, a predominantly black and working-class enclave. Almost 100 people from the community packed a basement room in the Anacostia Library to hear about the importance of the DC Fair Elections Act from a panel that included elected officials, former candidates, a clergy leader and an  affordable housing organizer. The discussion was about power and the real-world impact of having a government that caters only to rich and wealthy.
""Folks believe because I don't have money or I don't have influence in the halls of power, there's no need for me to engage, no need for me to invest, no need for me to ask questions, or the worst part—no need for me to vote,” explained panelist Markus Batchelor, Ward 8 Member DC State Board of Education. “With this program,” he said, “you've only got $10 or $20—that's going to make a difference. That helps build back up our civic life.""
During the immediate run-up to the committee vote, more than 80 community leaders signed a public letter urging Mayor Muriel Bowser and the DC Council to support the legislation on the grounds of racial equity.
One of the signers, Jeannette Mobley, Chair of the Ward 5 Democratic Committee, explained that she “supports Fair Elections because it offers small donors, which quite often are people of color, women and seniors, an opportunity to contribute to qualified candidates.""
The DC Council and Mayor would be wise to heed the words of leaders like Batchelor and Mobley and pass fair elections come January. And it doesn’t hurt that the Washington Post strongly endorsed DC fair elections this past weekend.",blog
"Democracy Dollars Can Make Every Voice Matter in Albuquerque’s Elections
A review of donations from individuals to mayoral and city council races in 2017 shows that those who contribute to campaigns, and therefore are more likely to have their voices heard, do not reflect Albuquerque’s diverse population. Instead, the donor class is whiter, older, and higher-income than the general population. As a result, people of color, young people, and middle- and working-class residents are underrepresented in the city’s politics and policies. Our elections are fairer—and our democracy works better—when politicians listen to the entire public instead of only to a few, unrepresentative big donors.
While residents under 35 make up nearly half (48 percent) of the population, they make up less than 10 percent of donors. Meanwhile, the roughly third of the population over the age of 50 make up a full 73 percent of the donor class. 
Half of all families in Albuquerque make $48,000 or less per year, yet only about a quarter of donors make less than that. Forty-one percent of donations came from households making more than $100,000. And roughly 400 donors, who each gave $1,000 or more, contributed the vast majority of all dollars collected by candidates from individuals. It should not be only the well-connected and well-resourced who fuel our elections—it should be everyday Albuquerqueans, regardless of how much money they make.
In November, Albuquerque residents will have the chance to fix this distortion of democracy by voting YES for Democracy Dollars. 
Democracy Dollars would strengthen the city’s public financing program by increasing the ability of candidates from all backgrounds to run for city office with the support of local residents. The program would equip residents, regardless of race, age, or income, to engage with candidates and elections in a new, exciting way—by giving their own publicly-financed Democracy Dollars directly to participating candidates of their choice. 
Albuquerqueans voted to establish and fund public financing for elections 14 years ago. Democracy Dollars would utilize these existing funds and modernize a critical investment in a local democracy that works for everyone: one in which donors are more diverse, elections are more inclusive and accessible, and city government is more responsive to everyone. ",policy-briefs
Watch as Demos' Amshula Jayaram and Adrien Salazar break down why New York State must act now on climate justice and campaign finance reform.,media
"The window for meaningful action on climate change is narrowing. Every year, as more climate impacts become “locked-in,” changes we have to make to save the planet become even harder to implement. Right now, fossil fuel industry campaign contributions to politicians are holding back the solutions we need.  
If we want to pass climate policies that could actually help reverse the climate crisis, then we also need to fix our democratic system that gives too much power to wealthy donors and big polluters. In New York, a state where wealthy donors contribute an outsized proportion of funds to campaigns, we have the opportunity to build a public campaign financing system that can address this imbalance. These two crises are interconnected.

"The technology that we choose to invest our tax dollars in determines the future of innovation, jobs, and the very infrastructure of our economy. In the U.S., the scale of tax incentives for the energy sector have overwhelmingly favored the dirty fossil fuel industry, reinforcing continued pollution that contributes to health hazards and environmental disasters that impact many, especially communities of color and low-income communities.
The Republican tax plans proposed by the House and Senate not only uphold the status quo fossil fuel economy that is deepening our global climate crisis, but also threaten the health of communities and the security of a viable renewable energy future.
The tax plan released by the Republican-controlled House earlier this month clearly targeted the renewable energy sector for the chopping block. The proposal gutted major supports for the sector, including the renewable energy production tax credit (PTC), which benefits wind, solar, geothermal, and other renewable energy projects.
Already scheduled to phase out by 2020, the House tax plan would cut the existing PTC incentives by one-third. The bill also is set to repeal the investment tax credit (ITC) for big solar projects, and the $7500 electric vehicle purchaser credit which has benefited consumers and electric vehicle manufacturers.
The PTC and ITC help to finance construction of renewable energy projects, and allow companies to attract investment. Bloomberg and Goldman Sachs projected that ending the PTC would disrupt wind energy development, cutting new wind projects in half. Existing wind projects represent $50 billion in investment and tens of thousands of jobs, mostly in rural communities.
While the House tax plan sent shockwaves across the renewable energy industry, the Senate bill attempted to leave these subsidies in place. The Senate plan maintains the PTC, ITC, and electric vehicle tax credits. Land-based wind energy production in the U.S. is concentrated in the Midwest and in the Great Plains, and 3 Republican senators from the region—Grassley (Iowa), Thune (S. Dakota), and Heller (Nevada)—have stated their opposition to altering the wind energy tax credits.
While the Senate plan could preserve these important incentives, the credits could be horse-traded if the 2 bills enter reconciliation. The fact that the credits are being threatened is enough to create market uncertainty that would make present renewable energy development more difficult. Large-scale wind and solar projects have long timelines and require massive capital investments up-front. An uncertain financial climate could threaten long-term investment for projects that bring jobs and tax revenues to many rural communities across the country.
At the same time as this risk is felt by renewable energy champions, both bills maintain fossil fuel subsidies that sustain the dirty energy economy intact. The Republican tax plans do not alter the estimated $14.7 billion per year in federal tax subsidies for oil, coal, and gas industry. These sacrosanct subsidies reflect the close ties of the fossil fuel industry to the government. Oil, gas, and coal industry contributed over $117 million to candidates, parties, and PACs in 2016, nearly all of which went to Republicans.
Transition to a clean energy economy that empowers communities means both investing in the infrastructure for a renewable energy economy, and divesting our taxpayer support of the fossil fuel industry. These subsidies allow corporations to rake in billions of dollars in profit and exploit public resources, and threaten the health of communities who live on the frontlines of fossil fuel production. Communities like indigenous peoples fighting the Dakota Access Pipelines, or families of color in Houston who live near toxic chemical plants and have endured Hurricane Harvey, bear the disproportionate cost of our fossil fuel economies.
The Republican tax plan clearly prioritizes maintaining profits for polluting fossil fuel industry over the health of communities. The cost of the tax plan is estimated at $1.5 trillion in additional federal debt over the next decade. The government will thus be examining nearly every public program to offset the costs of the tax plan.
This could add fuel to the administration’s intent to massively cut the Environmental Protection Agency—an intent made clear in its budget proposed earlier this year that outlined cutting EPA funding by a third. Such a cut would dramatically reduce the agency’s ability to conduct its work cleaning up toxics in communities, enforcing the Clean Water Act, and protecting our natural resources.
This tax plan is not about a future of clean energy for all. It is a vision of a future that maintains the profits of the powerful fossil fuel industry while potentially undermining progress that has been made to support a growing renewable energy sector. The massive cost of the plan also increases the chance that other key programs to protect our health and environment will be guillotined.
Congress can choose to invest in a future of clean energy and healthy communities, or one that drives the world over the cliff of pollution and climate change. The Republican tax plan is clear on which future it invests in.",blog
"In a critical moment of accelerating climate risk and new opportunity to address the climate change crisis, Demos stands in solidarity with the members and leaders of the Climate Justice Alliance for their recent articulation of a clear vision and mandate for ensuring that a federal climate policy package in the form of a Green New Deal is grounded in core principles for a Just Transition of our economy—away from fossil fuel dependency and toward a regenerative economy, where we uphold the right of all to a healthy, livable future.
The Green New Deal is a vision for comprehensive national policy that addresses climate change at the scale and scope we need, creates living-wage jobs, and addresses racial and economic inequity by investing in communities. Demos supports a Green New Deal, and the leadership of House members and organizations like Sunrise Movement in advocating for a House Select Committee on a Green New Deal to develop federal climate policy solutions. These policies and the democratic process for their development must also center racial and economic equity and grassroots community voices to ensure that all have an equal say and an equal chance in the next economy.
Demos supports the powerful potential of a Green New Deal policy platform and recognizes that a just Green New Deal must embody the objectives, solutions, and democratic values of a Just Transition. Over decades of organizing with frontline communities, Climate Justice Alliance members have developed principles and policies for clean air and water, community resilience, tribal sovereignty, and social and economic inclusion of poor people and people of color. A Just Transition includes ending fossil fuel extraction, ensuring support for fossil-fuel workers displaced by a renewable energy transition, supporting inclusive economic development in frontline communities, regulating air and climate pollution to the fullest extent possible, and recognizing tribal sovereignty over land and natural resources. A Green New Deal must also avoid false climate solutions, such as geo-engineering and market-based mechanisms that can produce inequitable outcomes for communities, as the Climate Justice Alliance outlines.
To achieve a Just Transition, a Green New Deal needs to be bold, comprehensive, publicly-funded on a large scale, and inclusive of those who are most impacted by climate change and pollution, especially young people, people of color, and poor people. Previous federal climate policy efforts have not sufficiently consulted environmental justice advocates and climate-impacted communities. Winning a Green New Deal starts with supporting the leadership from the front lines. State and local organizations are developing solutions to the climate crisis today. As Green New Deal policies get designed, Demos encourages genuine outreach and deep listening by Congressional leaders and national organizations to state and local organizations and communities affected by climate change. This leadership should be centered through bottom-up policy design for a Green New Deal that reverses climate change and builds a just and equitable economy for all.",blog
"Communities of color and low-income neighborhoods have borne the brunt of the impacts of pollution.
The effects of climate change are racially and economically inequitable. Communities of color and low-income neighborhoods have borne the brunt of the impacts of pollution. Due to historic disinvestment and discriminatory zoning and siting, these communities often are at the fence lines of polluting sites like power plants, major traffic thoroughfares, and incinerators. These are the same communities that are most vulnerable to and often bear the worst impacts of climate change.
Climate policy solutions must therefore be grounded in racial and economic justice.
In New York, the state legislature is on the verge of passing the Climate and Community Protection Act (CCPA)—a bill that centers frontline communities, public health, jobs, and justice.
The CCPA is a bill that would put New York on a path to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions economy-wide by 2050, invest 40% of state energy funds directly in disadvantaged communities, and create hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs for New Yorkers.
This bill is supported by over 180 groups in the NY Renews coalition, which Demos is a member of, and who we proudly honored with a Transforming America Award for their bold vision for equity-centered climate solutions.
The CCPA now has the support of the majority of legislators in both the state Senate and Assembly, but Governor Cuomo recently stated that he does not see climate action as a priority for the rest of the legislative session. Scientists tell us we are running out of time for meaningful action to avert the climate crisis. New York can and must do its part by passing this aggressive climate legislation.
With less than two weeks left in the New York legislative session we need your help to get this bill passed. Let's show the country what climate solutions can look like when they center and uplift communities most vulnerable to economic injustice and climate catastrophe.
Please call your New York legislator and, if you’re able, join us in Albany on June 11.",blog
"Climate catastrophe unfolds onto layers of historic disenfranchisement, displacement, and social exclusion that leaves poor people and communities of color bearing the brunt of disasters. Today September 20, marks the one-year anniversary of Hurricane Maria making landfall in Puerto Rico, where communities are still recovering. What has come to pass for Puerto Ricans since then is a prolonged humanitarian crisis driven by a legacy of colonialism and extraction. While this past week the ongoing impacts from Hurricane Florence in the Carolinas have displaced thousands. Extreme weather events like these are not only aggravated by climate change, they also exacerbate existing inequality that results from historic discrimination.
This week Hurricane Florence devastated communities across the Carolinas and Virginia, sending up to 40 inches of rain in some places. The storm has left hundreds of thousands without power, thousands of homes damaged, roads submerged, and at least 36 people dead. While the storm has been downgraded to a tropical depression, floodwaters continue to rise, breaching hog waste lagoons and coal ash sites, leaving behind a toxic slurry of coal ash and toxic waste. Flooding is estimated to get worse in the days ahead, and the worst environmental impacts of the storm may be yet to come.
The crisis carries the echoes of the intense Atlantic hurricane season one year ago, which saw Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria strike the gulf coast and the Caribbean. The intensity of these storms reflects how weather events are becoming more extreme in a climate-changed planet. They also reflect how the impacts of environmental disaster are not borne equally by all.
During Hurricane Harvey, Houston saw over 51 inches of rain. In the petro-chemical industry-rich region, oil and gas facilities and 13 Superfund sites were flooded, creating a toxic soup in affected communities that one year later still pose considerable health threats.
In North Carolina, the poorest communities and communities of color will bear the brunt of the ongoing damage. Historically, Eastern North Carolina is the site of colonies built by former freed slaves. Black communities in the region, many in poor rural areas will have the most difficult time recovering from the storm’s impacts because of historic inequality.
Communities will also face worsened environmental hazards in the wake of Hurricane Florence. Wilmington and other impacted towns hold Superfund sites, and the storm has resulted in the collapse of a coal ash landfill, spilling the toxic ash into flood waters. It is well documented that people of color and low-income people are disproportionately impacted by hazardous sites and pollution.
Not only do the most vulnerable communities face a kind of environmental apartheid absorbing the disproportionate burden of these disasters’ impacts; in recovery, they continue to face discrimination and disenfranchisement. Displaced communities are at risk of losing homes, land, and resources to speculators and developers. They even risk their fundamental rights due to historic discrimination.
A year after Hurricane Maria, many Puerto Ricans are just beginning to rebuild. The slow pace of recovery is not only a failure of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, but reflective of the ongoing colonial relationship of the island to the U.S. government. While Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, President Trump publicly denies their humanity, concocting a delusion that the island did not actually lose the thousands of lives reported.
Displaced Puerto Ricans who have settled in the U.S. face a climate of discrimination and exclusion. A study based on cellphone data found that between October 2017 and February 2018, almost 400,000 Puerto Ricans left the island, and about 150,000 landed in Florida. These U.S. citizens arrived to find themselves scapegoated as Spanish-speaking migrants, and disenfranchised of their rights to equal participation in democracy.
In August Demos filed a lawsuit against the Florida Secretary of State and 32 Florida counties for not providing elections materials in Spanish as the law requires, even as thousands of displaced Puerto Ricans increase the state’s Spanish-speaking electorate. One of the plaintiffs in the case is Marta Rivera, who came to Florida in October after losing everything in Hurricane Maria. In early September, a federal judge granted a preliminary injunction ordering Florida counties to provide bilingual elections materials in time for this November’s election.
Climate change, its toxic impacts, and the displacement it causes aggravate the social exclusion and discrimination faced by communities of color and poor communities. Not only is climate change exacerbated by billionaire fossil fuel executives who fund politicians to block meaningful solutions, it also expands existing social inequality and environmental apartheid. Extreme weather events become “threat multipliers,” increasing health risks to communities already living near hazardous facilities, as in the case of Houston or Wilmington, and displacing communities and exposing them to heightened disenfranchisement, as in the case of Puerto Ricans in Florida.
On this anniversary of Hurricane Maria, as communities in the Carolinas continue to face rising waters, achieving a just recovery will require more than phasing out fossil fuels from our economy. Most importantly, climate justice will require fixing our broken democracy to release the stranglehold of the fossil fuel industry on politicians. It will require radical inclusion of impacted peoples in the political process, so that black and brown bodies are no longer relegated to absorbing the brunt of climate catastrophe.

"Climate change means that the extreme weather events we are witnessing, like Hurricane Harvey and the heatwave currently sweeping southern California, will be more common and more intense. The level of flooding that Harvey has caused in Houston has traditionally been expected once every 500 years, but in fact “500-year floods” have happened 3 times in Houston in the last 3 years. The Washington Post suggested that 2016 be called “the year of the flood,” but Harvey alone has made 2017 the new “year of the flood.” The Post also noted that 2016 was an intense year for droughts and forest fires around the country. The future promises more natural disasters worsened by climate change as a result of inaction by those in power who deny climate reality.
In June, the New York Times produced an important map showing the predicted economic impact of climate change on counties across the United States. The map shows that counties in the southern states, from North Carolina across to California and southward, would carry the greatest economic costs of climate change. Many of the counties in these states could lose 5 to 15 percent of GDP per year, with the poorest counties suffering some of the largest declines.
While revealing the geographic inequity of climate change impacts in the U.S., one important point that these reports failed to highlight is that climate change will disproportionately harm people of color. People of color are overrepresented in the southern states, in the poorest counties, and among outdoor workers.
Latinos comprise a large proportion in these communities. Many Latino workers work outdoors in occupations such as landscaping, farming, and construction. The Times noted the toll that heat takes on people who work outdoors in southern states. It reported on a worker who “vomited and convulsed after hours of mowing lawns in stifling heat.” Latinos are already three times as likely as non-Latinos to die on the job from excessive heat. Climate change will put even more Latino workers at risk. 
Hurricane Harvey, like its southern predecessors Rita and Katrina, already demonstrates that climate change will disrupt the lives of millions in the South, and will leave communities that have been historically marginalized more vulnerable to disaster. Harvey’s impacts are layered onto years of neglect of infrastructure, mapped onto racial lines, and exacerbated by the failure to plan for climate adaptation.
Addressing climate change will require not only reducing carbon emissions, but also investing in infrastructure, particularly in the communities most vulnerable to its impacts. Resilience to climate change calls for transforming the energy economy as well as building resilient neighborhoods through re-investment in communities of color and poor communities.",blog
"Testimony to the NY State Assembly Committee on Environmental Conservation's Hearing on Climate Change
New York is one of the top 10 carbon-emitting states in the country. We must do our part to reverse the climate crisis by passing the strongest climate proposal we can[.]
Assemblymember Englebright and other honorable members, thank you for the opportunity to share testimony today on what is one of the most critical issues of our time. My name is Adrien Salazar. I am an immigrant from the Philippines, raised in California, now living in Washington Heights here in Manhattan. I am a Campaign Strategist for Demos, a racial and economic justice policy organization based here in New York City. We advocate for economic justice, racial equity, and democratic empowerment, and in my work, I am committed to ensuring the policy solutions we enact to address the climate crisis also build a more just and equitable society. This is why we at Demos support the Climate and Community Protection Act, which we see as one of the boldest climate bills in the country. 
The scale and severity of the climate crisis is clear and present for thousands of New Yorkers and millions of people around the world. From superstorms like Sandy to hurricanes in the Gulf South, from wildfires in California to the recent deluges devastating farms in Nebraska and villages in Mozambique, climate change is disrupting livelihoods, and is for many a matter of life or death. I was born in the central Philippines, a region that is a hotspot for typhoons. In 2008, my birth town was struck by Typhoon Fengshen, flooding the region and leaving people without electricity for days. In 2014, the world saw the deadliest storm on record, Typhoon Haiyan, level the city of Tacloban in the Philippines. I have a niece and nephew in California two and three years old, who during the increasingly intense fire seasons do not go outside because of the toxic air quality that pervades a hundred square-mile region around fire zones. In New York we witnessed Hurricane Sandy disrupt thousands of lives, cause dozens of deaths, and create nearly $33 billion in damages for the state. The climate crisis is palpable for many of us, and as the recent U.N. report on preventing over 1.5 degrees Celsius global warming demonstrated, the window for acting is getting narrower and narrower.
New York is one of the top 10 carbon-emitting states in the country. We must do our part to reverse the climate crisis by passing the strongest climate proposal we can to drive down the state’s carbon emissions while protecting the communities most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The CCPA is that proposal—it would be the boldest climate law a state has passed in the country, not only because it sets the state on a path of aggressive emissions reduction, but because it also tackles the inequity faced by communities that bear the disproportionate burden of pollution and the impacts of climate change.
Black and brown communities face a double-edged sword: We bear the brunt of not only the pollution of the  fossil-fuel based economy, but also higher vulnerability to climate change impacts.
Climate change affects everyone, but its impacts are not felt equally. As a result of historic discrimination and disinvestment in communities of color and low-income communities, there are neighborhoods in the state that breathe more toxic air than others. Black and brown communities face a double-edged sword: We bear the brunt of not only the pollution of the  fossil-fuel based economy, but also higher vulnerability to climate change impacts. New York must protect vulnerable populations from the extreme impacts of climate change, and ensure that no community is left behind in the transition to a renewable energy economy. We can increase resilience to climate impacts, reduce emissions, and reinvest in communities, tackling racial and economic justice simultaneously as we build a green economy.  We can design policy to address climate risks and equity—and before the legislature today, we have a bill that does this in the Climate and Community Protection Act.
The CCPA is not just a climate bill. It is also a racial justice bill, a public health bill, and an economic development bill. In addition to calling for an economy-wide reduction of all greenhouse gas emissions in the state by 2050, it also directs 40 percent of state funds for achieving renewable energy targets to disadvantaged communities. It creates an equity screen that would assess equity impacts of rules, regulation, investment, and other aspects of policy implementation. The bill requires the state to identify barriers to accessing renewable energy and energy efficiency programs. It requires consideration of not just carbon emissions but also associated co-pollutants, which contribute to public health risks like asthma. And the bill requires strong employment and contracting standards, including apprenticeship opportunities, and prevailing wage standards for jobs created through achieving emissions reduction. For all these reasons, the bill is ambitious in centering equity for a just economic transition, creating good jobs for working families. and investing in communities most in need. 
By supporting the communities most affected by fossil-fuel pollution and climate change impacts, we improve air quality, public health, and the economy for all New Yorkers. The final version of this bill must maintain these standards of equity, and in so doing can send a signal to the rest of the country that addressing climate change means also building an economy that leaves no community behind.
An economy-wide target of achieving zero emissions is not only feasible but necessary if we are to address climate change at the scale of the crisis. In order to prevent catastrophic climate impacts, we need to rapidly decarbonize the economy, and to achieve this equitably, we must reduce emissions at the source. The governor has suggested that setting a carbon neutral or net-zero emissions target is necessary to give the state and industry flexibility to meet targets. This is neither bold nor ambitious. Setting a goal for zero emissions 30 years from now can send a signal to industry to accelerate innovation required to bring all sectors to zero emissions. New York can set the standard for bringing emissions to zero that other states will follow.
Secondly, a carbon neutral emissions-reduction regime that enables carbon-negative technology and carbon offsets to meet reduction targets inherently creates risk for emissions to persist in communities burdened by pollution. Polluting infrastructure like power plants, cement producers, transportation, and other carbon-intensive sectors are disproportionately located in low-income communities and communities of color. We cannot allow industries to bypass targets by investing in carbon credits or offsets generated by carbon-negative technology and practices, because this does not result in emissions reduction at the source. Carbon offsets also do not reduce dangerous co-pollutants that cause respiratory and other diseases. A carbon-neutral emissions reduction target effectively would require the creation of a carbon credit or offset market, a system that we know fails to achieve emissions reductions at the source. A 2018 study of California’s cap-and-trade program that hinges on carbon credits found that in the period of 2011-2015, facilities regulated under the program were located disproportionately in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods, and that co-pollutant emissions from facilities in these regions correlated with greenhouse gas emissions.1 In California’s carbon trading system, polluters can pay for their emissions through various market instruments such as allowances and offsets, instead of directly reducing emissions. The market flexibility this is alleged to provide for emissions reductions, the study shows, in fact resulted in emissions increases in communities already disproportionately exposed to air pollution.
The study found that these facilities resulted in higher local emissions during the study period, demonstrating that a system based on offsets may not result in local improvements with respect to harmful co-pollutant emissions, and can lead to an increase in inequitable health outcomes for already pollution-burdened communities. In plain terms, carbon offsets or credits can create pollution hotspots. They do not decrease local emissions, and as this study found, can allow the increase of local pollution. 
The argument for carbon neutrality suggests the need for flexibility for industry, but this is a red herring. 
The argument for carbon neutrality suggests the need for flexibility for industry, but this is a red herring. Carbon-negative technology, carbon credit systems, and carbon offsets carry the risk of violating the health of communities already burdened by pollution. The CCPA already has flexibility built into it—with a requirement of implementation evaluation every 4 years with recommendations for adjustments of targets and future actions. Setting a target for achieving zero emissions can jumpstart a national conversation of what is required to decarbonize the economy, and can accelerate research, development, and investment in the technology needed to achieve this goal.
Lastly, I would like to emphasize that directing 40 percent of investments to disadvantaged communities is a critical element to achieving equitable outcomes as the state reduces emissions. As previously mentioned, polluting facilities and infrastructure are sited disproportionately in low-income communities and communities of color. These communities also tend to be the same communities most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Renewable energy investment in the state can spark economic development, building local wealth, and resilience. Reducing pollution and carbon emissions in frontline communities can create growth and can redress historic discrimination and disinvestment as we build a renewable energy economy. California set its own target for investment of greenhouse gas reduction funds in disadvantaged communities at 25 percent. As the state monitored investments, it found that the state was exceeding its target, investing over 50 percent of funds in vulnerable communities because projects in these communities resulted in the most effective emissions reductions for the state. 
The CCPA directs investment to generate tens of thousands of good jobs as the state expands energy efficiency, renewable energy, clean transportation, and infrastructure improvements. An analysis by my organization has found that the CCPA would generate an average of 150,000 jobs in the first decade alone. If you also count induced jobs—jobs created by the purchasing power of new clean energy workers—the total employment effect statewide is to create and support approximately 220,000 jobs initially.2 Investment will create an estimated $13.8 billion in income for New Yorkers, and $138 billion over the decade. Simply put, the CCPA can drive an economic revolution in the state, and by targeting a significant portion of investment in disadvantaged communities, can help dramatically reduce income and economic inequality.
In conclusion, the CCPA is an ambitious bill in its climate and equity goals—one that can and is serving as a model for states across the country. In the last few months, several states have passed or are considering clean or renewable energy sector targets. If passed, the CCPA could set a new standard for tackling emissions reduction economy-wide, including industries that we may find challenging in the present moment. We can send a signal to other states across the country, and to industry, that we are ready to enact what is necessary to reverse the climate crisis—and that means every sector of society must be part of the solution. New York State must not shy away from a target of reducing emissions to zero, economy-wide. We must invest in communities and make sure we reduce the risks of pollution and climate change on those most burdened. We can rise to the challenge—and the opportunity—of the climate crisis to build a more just and equitable society while protecting our most vulnerable communities. The CCPA sets the path for New York State to lead the way.",testimony-and-public-comment
"The first Earth Day celebration was an action.
In the late 1960s, communities were feeling the full effects of unregulated industry dumping toxins in their neighborhoods and waterways. Rivers across the country, like the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland, Ohio, were saturated with so much toxic waste they literally caught on fire. In January 1969, an oil spill off the coast of Santa Barbara released over 3 million gallons of oil across 35 miles of Southern California coast. Communities saw the drastic effects of pollution, pesticides, and toxic waste destroying natural life and causing negative health impacts in their neighborhoods. So on April 22, 1970, the first Earth Day, 20 million Americans took to their streets and parks to express their shared frustration at the seemingly endless damage industry was wreaking upon life.
Nearly 50 years later we are witnessing ongoing mobilizations in response to a global climate change crisis. On Monday, April 23, an estimated 1500 people from across the state coalesced at the capitol building in Albany, New York and marched together, calling for Governor Cuomo to end all fossil fuel infrastructure development, put the state on a path to 100 percent renewable energy, and make corporate polluters pay for their climate change-causing emissions.
This rally follows waves of mobilizations across the country. In 2014, over 300,000 people came together in the People’s Climate March in New York City, with parallel marches occurring all over the world. A repeat march took place in 2017 in Washington D.C., with tens of thousands marching to the White House. Today these mobilizations are bringing together vast swaths of the American public, from environmental groups, to racial and economic justice groups, to labor organizations, all of whom recognize that the fight for a livable planet is a fight for justice.
Our democracy and economy are under threat by climate change, which is disproportionately hurting communities of color, low-income families, and young people. The causes and effects of climate change are interwoven with racial, economic, and political inequity. We need bold political action to address the scale of environmental, social, and political crises we face today, and groups are building bridges across movements to address these intertwined, wicked problems.
The first Earth Day was a result of cross-movement solidarity. Labor groups were, some argue, the biggest supporters of Earth Day. The United Auto Workers produced materials and got workers across the country to participate in the nationwide action.
Groups today are building alliances to call on leaders to end the vicious cycles of disenfranchisement of large portions of society. New York Renews,* for example, one of the groups that helped organize the Earth Day action in Albany, brings together over 140 labor, environmental justice, racial and economic justice groups, and others. The coalition is advocating for climate change solutions that invest in and uplift communities of color and low-income, climate-impacted communities in New York State.
In this political moment when the federal government is empowering climate-deniers in its administration, local- and state-level solutions are carrying the momentum forward for climate action. In coalitions like New York Renews, the Alliance for Jobs and Clean Energy in Washington State, and others around the country, environmental justice groups are working with labor and economic justice advocates to advance climate policy that invests in communities.
The first Earth Day action in 1970 helped successfully pressure the federal government to create the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and pass the Clean Air, Clean Water, and Endangered Species Acts in that year. There is an opportunity in this moment of climate crisis to enact solutions and build a society in which all communities can thrive.
The Climate and Community Protection Act, a piece of legislation New York Renews has been advancing, for example, not only sets a standard for 100 percent renewable energy in the state by 2050, but also requires 40 percent of all state energy funding to go to climate-vulnerable low-income communities and communities of color.
Addressing climate crisis will require rapid economic transformation. This transformation can invest wealth and power in communities. In states across the country, groups are innovating and advancing climate policy that invests climate solutions, good jobs, and needed infrastructure directly in impacted communities and workers.
Monday’s action in Albany saw dozens of such groups from across New York State coming together behind a shared vision for a just and equitable 100 percent renewable energy economy for New York, where corporate polluters pay for their climate pollution.
We need “all hands on deck” to ensure justice in the fight against climate change, and to ensure the needs of the most vulnerable are met in the face of climate catastrophe. By building coalitions and bridging movements, we can win solutions that address environmental crisis, reinvest in our communities, and create a healthy, thriving future for all.

"A Big Win for New York State on Jobs and the Economy
New York State’s Climate and Community Protection Act (CCPA) is a bold climate action policy for the people of New York. It requires a 50 percent reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030, and sets a timeline for achieving 100 percent renewable energy economy-wide by 2050. If ratified, this would be the strongest enforceable renewable energy standard and timeline in the country. Just as important, renewable energy goals under the CCPA are aligned with employment and equity goals for New York State residents, in 2 basic forms: 
Developed and promoted by the 160-member New York Renews Coalition—and passed by the New York State Assembly for 3 consecutive years (2016-2018)—the CCPA is currently awaiting action in the New York State Legislature. Across the country, passing the CCPA is arguably the most significant opportunity we have for implementing bold, statewide climate policy—the significance of which is only magnified by the current tidal wave of federal attacks on environmental regulation and climate change policy. The CCPA does not have substantial immediate budget implications, but it requires the state to develop a comprehensive plan for achieving 100 percent renewable energy by 2050, with significant input from stakeholders in the most impacted communities and across the state.
Despite the urgent need for rapid greenhouse gas reductions and a comprehensive clean energy transition—as underscored sharply in the most recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change1—it is reasonable to be concerned about the economic effects of these changes, welcome as they are. The fossil fuel industry and its advocacy allies are spending tens of millions of dollars annually to exploit this concern, not least by disseminating false information about the reality and causes of climate change as well as the economics of climate change and a clean energy transition. A familiar refrain in this reckless misinformation campaign is that climate policy is just another form of liberal “job-killing regulation.” But nothing could be further from the truth. 
Ignoring climate change is the real job-killer in today’s economy, and this is very much the case in New York State. New York is well-positioned to reap employment gains and other economic benefits from the clean energy and clean economy transition promoted by the CCPA. In contrast to a number of states whose economies rely heavily on fossil fuel industries—in the Gulf Coast South, Appalachia, and the Great Plains—New York’s energy and employment profiles are among the least fossil fuel-dependent in the country. New York’s positive starting points on clean energy bode well for a successful and economically beneficial clean energy transition.  
A combination of energy efficiency, renewable energy, and clean transportation investments, if fully scaled to achieve the CCPA’s renewable energy targets, promises significant employment and income gains for New Yorkers. This is especially true in light of New York’s relatively small fossil fuel workforce, as noted. The state’s fossil fuel workforce is comprised of about 13,000 workers in a total statewide workforce of nearly 9 million, according to estimates by the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst (PERI).2 While some fossil fuel job losses in the clean energy transition are probably unavoidable, financial support to help these workers transition to new employment should be part of the state’s plan for reaching 100 percent renewable energy economy-wide by 2050. 
Overall, the jobs picture under the CCPA is overwhelmingly positive. PERI finds that a mix of renewable-energy and energy-efficiency investments sufficient to put New York on a pathway to 100 percent renewable energy and zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 would total about $31 billion annually over the first decade. PERI estimates that such investment will support 160,000 direct and indirect jobs initially and an average of about 150,000 in each year over the first decade, or the equivalent of roughly 1.5 million employment-years in total over the decade (by 2030, the number of jobs supported could decline slightly to 145,000 due to productivity gains). If you also count induced jobs—jobs created by the purchasing power of new clean energy workers—the total employment effect statewide is to create and support approximately 220,000 initially and 212,000 jobs on average over a decade, for a total of 2.1 million employment-years over a decade (see Table 1).3
Job creation, it should be underscored, generates additional income in communities, income that should be counted against costs in economic analyses of a clean energy transition. As we see in Table 2, employment in the main sectors for clean energy investment—renewables and energy efficiency—is well-paying, with average compensation of roughly $70,000 for workers without a 4-year college degree. Average compensation overall in these sectors is approximately $89,500.4
If the investment needed to achieve New York’s renewable energy goals as codified in the CCPA can be projected to create about 150,000 new direct and indirect jobs over a decade (or 150,000 employment-years annually), the clean energy transition will generate approximately $11.3 billion for clean energy workers across the state per year.5 If induced jobs are also counted, the income generated by direct clean energy jobs and related indirect and induced employment can be projected to total nearly $13.8 billion per year or approximately 1.3 percent of state GDP, and $138 billion cumulatively over a decade (see Table 3).6 From 2031 to 2050, PERI estimates job creation in a range of 50,000-90,000. If we average this out to 70,000 jobs, or the equivalent of 1.3 million employment-years over the 19-year period, clean energy investment will inject approximately $98 billion in additional income into New York’s economy in the second and third decades of the clean energy transition. Over the 30-year period from 2020 to 2050, income generated by the CCPA for New Yorkers will total approximately $236 billion.
Workers without a 4-year college degree hold approximately 55 percent of jobs in the renewable-energy and energy-efficiency sectors. Thus, a majority of new employment generated by clean energy investments under the CCPA policy will benefit working-class residents as defined by education level, generating approximately $5.8 billion annually in working-class income from direct and indirect clean energy jobs in the New York State economy over a decade. Women and people of color, however, are not proportionately employed in clean energy sectors—26 percent and 33 percent, respectively; if the CCPA establishes strong standards for diversifying employment and contracting in programs and projects that contribute to the policy’s emissions goals, this could have positive effects in closing harmful employment gaps by race and gender.7
The CCPA requires that 40 percent of public money invested toward the policy’s renewable energy goals be targeted for environmentally vulnerable, low-income communities—a hallmark of this policy. If we estimate that one-third of investment for the energy goals will be public or publicly subsidized, the CCPA’s 40 percent equity mandate will support the creation of approximately 21,000 jobs, or 210,000 job-years over a decade, in high-need communities. In these communities, workers without a 4-year college degree will enjoy roughly $14.7 billion in clean energy income over a decade under the CCPA.  
The CCPA’s clean energy transition will also generate broader economic benefits, in several dimensions. For example, only about 10.5 percent of New York’s primary energy needs are supplied by in-state sources such as hydropower, biofuels, and renewable energy. Almost all of the refined petroleum products used by New York residents are imported from other states. Out-of-state energy expenditures averaged approximately $38 billion per year between 2005 and 2015 and totaled more than $427 billion over that period.8  
Getting to 100 percent renewable energy will require substantial insourcing of power production, mainly from on-site renewable sources such as wind and solar. Even more significant, reducing reliance on imported transportation fuels by establishing stringent fuel efficiency standards and promoting electric vehicles will generate substantial savings for New York State drivers. In both dimensions, the in-sourcing of energy will not only reduce the state’s overall energy bill, it will also generate localized economic activity and supply-chain effects promising even more economic activity. For example, energy storage services, already a nearly $1 billion industry supporting nearly 4,000 jobs across New York, is likely to grow proportionately with renewable-energy expansion. Under New York’s own stated clean energy goals (which are broadly aligned with the CCPA, but not currently enforceable), a recent estimate from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority projects an energy storage workforce of as many as 27,000 workers and revenues of as much as $8.7 billion annually by 2030.9
In addition, new tax revenue from clean energy jobs and businesses will generate fiscal savings for the state. Healthcare savings and likely reduced enrollment in social benefit programs (in significant part due to improvements in health) will also benefit New Yorkers. Along with these benefits, the potential for community ownership of distributed renewable-energy generation—a key principle of the NY Renews platform—could be a source of asset-building in low-wealth communities. 
The bottom line is exceptionally clear: New Yorkers will enjoy substantial economic gains under a comprehensive clean-energy transition. Thus, the self-interested question proffered by opponents of clean energy and climate change policy is literally turned on its head: how can we afford not to achieve zero emissions by investing in a complete and accelerated clean energy transition? That’s what our elected leaders should be asking themselves—and many are—if they care about economic growth, opportunity, and well-being for the people of New York State.",policy-briefs
"WASHINGTON ― Tens of thousands of activists demonstrated in cities across the country on Saturday ― the date when Americans’ taxes are normally due ― to demand the release of President Donald Trump’s tax returns. [...]
Heather McGhee, president of the liberal think tank Demos, focused on the way tax loopholes and other schemes rich people use to avoid taxes have deprived public institutions and services of much-needed revenue.
“Every year at budget time we’re coming up short. They tell us there is not enough money to make the schools better ― or even keep them open in some neighborhoods,” McGhee said.
“Across the country, Americans are calling ‘bullshit!’” she concluded, prompting the crowd to repeatedly chant “bullshit” in response.

"This past Saturday, in cities across our nation, Americans rose up around the issue that brought our founding fathers to their feet and began a revolution: taxes. I’m proud that I, like tens of thousands of other Americans, followed in their footsteps and lent my voice to the countless others.
Our message is as simple now as it was back in 1776: Our current tax system is broken and undemocratic. It is absurd that the wealthiest in our society carry such a comparatively small share of the burden, while our working families — many of whom are just managing to make ends meet, or can’t even — struggle to pay their tax bills. Beyond the unbearably unequal and oppressive distribution of tax responsibility and subsequent hardship, it is appalling that our own president has been able to keep his tax returns in the shadows.
Donald Trump has continually denied the American public the opportunity to know not only how much he pays in taxes, but also from where exactly his unknown and questionable fortune originates. Not to mention whether he is honestly working for the American people or on behalf of his foreign investments. All of this matters, not only from a practical standpoint, but from a moral one.
It matters that every American pays their fair share. It matters that we know the share of our president’s own responsibility. It matters that we have access to information about the president’s financial interests, as they undeniably serve to inform his priorities and loyalties.
Here’s why else people, including me, were marching this weekend.
Imagine waking up every morning, worried that you could be drinking water poisoned with lead. Step into the shoes of a kindergarten teacher, responsible for a class of students who don't know how to read yet because they couldn’t go to preschool. Envision the horror of getting into a car accident because you couldn't swerve around a huge pothole in the middle of a decrepit highway. Put yourself in the position of a college student right now, dreading graduation because of the crushing load of student debt you have to carry. Or imagine that you are an employer purposely cheating your workers out of wages they’ve earned, because you know the Department of Labor is too understaffed to catch you.
These aren't hypothetical situations — these are realities for millions of Americans. Today. Right now. In the United States. All of these troubles have one immediate cause: Not enough public revenue is invested in the programs and services that improve people’s lives. It takes money to ensure the welfare of a nation’s people, and there’s simply not enough of it. And what money that does exist is being stripped, now more than ever, from the programs that support the people of this country.
Part of the problem is that the millionaires in Congress — and the wealthy super donors who elevate them to their positions of power — choose to allocate public money on defense and war, as opposed to investing in the public programs that strengthen our communities. In 2016, federal spending on everything that wasn’t defense, Social Security, or Medicare added up tojust 3.3% of our GDP – the lowest share in 50 years. Since 2010, we’ve cut spending by $150 billion on these vital public programs that fund everything from vital scientific research and K-12 education to border security and highways.
But the main cause of this problem is that the United States takes in the least amount of revenue of any advanced nation other than Chile or Mexico. And because of that, we simply do not have the dollars to meet the needs of our people or the planet.
The other equally appalling reason why the United States fails to invest enough in our people and their needs: Wealthy individuals don’t pay their fair share of taxes. 
Today, over $400 billion a year is missing being stolen from public coffers due to tax evasion by wealthy people.
Yes, that’s billion — with a b.
And those billions in tax evasion put a huge hole in our national budget. If wealthy Americans paid their fair share, the federal government would have about 12% more to spend. It’s also enough money to reverse cuts to our vital programs, as well as to clean our water systems, fix our bridges, send every kid to college debt-free, provide high-quality childcare for every parent who needs it — and much more.
It’s quite possible Donald Trump is the poster boy for tax evasion by the rich. Of course, we won’t know until we see his returns, assuming that ever happens. But he did brag that paying no taxes “makes him smart.” And now he wants to give billionaires and millionaires — people like himself and most of his cabinet — more tax cuts so the richest among us can shirk their responsibility to care, educate, feed, and invest in Americans.
Unsurprisingly, Trump got nearly everything wrong when it comes to his position on taxes. When CEOs use loopholes and high priced accountants to avoid paying taxes, they are not just “playing the game” or “using the system to their benefit” — they are shortchanging the great people of our country. They are stripping our economy of one of the fundamental checks and balances that makes it work, that makes it possible for the entirety of America to self-sustain. Paying taxes does not make you a loser — it makes you an investor in the most precious resource of all, the diverse and vibrant people of America. When wealthy Americans bail on their tax responsibility, they aren’t just depriving other people of resources they need — they’re shooting themselves in the foot ultimately.
So, on Saturday, April 15, we stood together to say enough of the tax cheats. Enough with robbing from our future to line the pockets of those who are already wealthy. As Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes once said, “Taxes are the price we pay civilization.” It’s time for us to invest in our future together, so that our civilization can meet America’s needs and fulfill all our aspirations.

"How We Can Fix the Housing Affordability Crisis
All Americans should have an affordable home. Equal opportunity for all requires providing decent affordable housing for all. Today, tens of millions of families pay so much for housing that they have little left to save or invest, and our housing policy does almost nothing to enable them to build wealth. Yet policymakers routinely deploy housing policy to assist millionaires with their multi-million dollar homes, second homes, and yachts, providing more resources for the already-wealthy to build more assets. As a result, policymakers perpetuate disadvantage for some and opportunity for others. Policymakers should instead make investments in affordable rental housing to help all American families build wealth.
In the United States, we already spend enough on housing to make it affordable for all, but because most of these dollars go to the affluent, we are in the midst of a severe housing affordability crisis. This problem has become worse over time, and it will continue to worsen if we fail to shift our federal expenditures away from subsidizing the wealthy and toward investments in affordable rental housing. To make housing affordable and to reduce housing insecurity for low-income households, policymakers must create enough rental housing dedicated to low-income households to reduce rents at the lower end of the rental market. This is a longer-term solution, since the needed housing cannot be constructed right away. Instituting rent control, however, would immediately work to preserve affordable housing and prevent high rents from becoming even higher. And preventing landlords from evicting low-income households without cause (a maneuver often used to attract higher-income renters) is another important step to preserve affordable housing and keephousing secure.
To address the needs of low-income renters, Demos calls for the following from our federal policymakers:
 
 
All Americans, whether they are renters or homeowners, should have an affordable home. Renters are the focus of this proposal because they are twice as likely as homeowners to have unaffordable1 housing.2 Renting households are also more likely to comprise people of color.3 America has a long history of racial discrimination against people of color in its housing policies, and these policies have dramatically reduced the wealth in communities of color.4Making rental housing affordable for all is an important step to move our society toward the goal of equal opportunity for all.
On average, renters have much less wealth than homeowners. In 2016, the median value of financial assets (not including the value of the home and other property) for homeowners was $68,000, while it was only $2,000 for renters.5 In spite of this disparity, our housing policy favors homeowners over renters, and rich homeowners over middle- and low-income homeowners.6 This orientation toward rich homeowners has rightly been called an upside down policy.7 The neediest households should receive the most help, not the wealthiest ones.
 
It is generally recommended that households not spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing.8 In recent years, the average American household, renters and homeowners combined, spent 33 percent of its income on housing, just above the 30 percent threshold.9 Households spending above this threshold are considered to be “cost-burdened.” In this discussion, housing that costs more than 30 percent of a household’s income is considered to be “unaffordable.”
When households spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing, they have less for other necessities, savings, and investments. While the 30 percent standard is a general recommendation, it is most important for middle- to lower-income households. If someone earning a million dollars a year wishes to spend $750,000 on housing, for example, he would still have $250,000 for everything else and would still be able to maintain a very high standard of living. For thisreason, the following discussion will focus on American households in the middle- and lower-income groups.
To attain the goal of affordable housing for all, policymakers need to radically re-make our housing policy, starting with rental housing. In 1960, two-thirds of the renting households in the bottom quintile paid more than 30 percent of their income on housing (see Figure 1). By 2016, more than 80 percent of these bottom-quintile renters were cost-burdened. In 1960, about a quarter of renters in the lower-middle quintile were cost-burdened; by 2016, more than half were cost-burdened. Nearly one-quarter of households in the middle quintile— those households solidly in the middle class—were cost-burdened in 2016, up almost 20 percentage points from 1960. There is every reason to expect the rates of cost burdens to continue to increase without government intervention.
There are multiple factors behind the housing affordability crisis, but a major part of it is that private developers and the government simply have not been building enough affordable rental housing. When the demand for housing increases but the supply does not match it, costs will rise, and housing will become unaffordable tomore and more households. We have seen this across the country. For example, in the 1990s in New York City, private developers built only 85,000 new units for an additional 456,000 city residents. Further, many of these units were priced for higher-income tenants.10 From 2010 to 2017, the San Francisco Bay Area added more than 500,000 jobs, but fewer than 100,000 new housing units.11 In the Washington,D.C. metropolitan area, the population grew 7 percent from 2010 to 2016, but the number of housing units grew by less than half that amount.12 Because of this dynamic, there has been an overall upward pressure on rents.
Additionally, policymakers have allowed the continual loss of rental units specifically designated to be affordable for lower-income households. For example, the Institute for Housing Studies reports that Chicago lost nearly 9,000 affordable rental units between 2014 and 2015, despite there being a growth of over 2,500 renter households needing affordable housing.13​​​​​​​ Nationally, we have lost at least 400,000 subsidized housing units through demolition and conversion to market-rate units since the late 1980s.14​​​​​​​ The Joint Center for Housing Studies estimates that we will lose over 1 million more subsidized rental units over the next decade.15​​​​​​​ When we add the loss of affordable housing to our failure to build sufficient housing to keep up with population growth, we have a monumental housing affordability crisis.
Currently 7 million extremely low-income households are in unaffordable rental homes where they are paying more than 30 percent of their income on housing.16​​​​​​​ This shortage of affordable rentals will not be addressed by the private sector because there is no profit for the private sector to serve extremely low-income residents without government subsidies.17​​​​​​​ Another 6 million renters with higher incomes are also in unaffordable rentals.18​​​​​​​ The population of renting households is expected to increase by about 500,000 per year for the next 10 years.19 This means that we will need in excess of 500,000 rental units a year to lower rents and increase the affordability of rental housing. Additionally, it is important that we minimize future losses of affordable housing. We must make major investments in affordable housing to address these needs.
 
In the Housing Act of 1949, the federal government declared that “the general welfare and security of the Nation and the health and living standards of its people require housing production . . . sufficient to remedy the serious housing shortage.” The authors of the Act addedthat “the goal of a decent home and a suitable living environment for every American family” would contribute to “the advancement of the growth, wealth, and security of the Nation.”20 While there are many important differences between 1949 and today, the concerns about the shortage of housing and its impact on the wealth of Americans are the same.
High housing costs harm families. In the worst-case scenario, high housing costs lead to homelessness, which negatively affects all psychological, social, economic, and health conditions for a family. Even without causing homelessness, high housing costs can lead to evictions or, in the wake of the steady rise in costs, the need to move frequently to find more affordable housing. Homelessness and frequent moves have a negative effect on children’s academic achievement and increases the likelihood that children will repeat a grade and drop out of school.21 High housing costs also worsen health outcomes. Families forego health care and nutritious food so that they have more money for housing. High housing costs can also drive families into unsafe housing, which increases the risk of accidents and illness.22 Finally, high rents have been shown to reduce the likelihood of individuals purchasing a home.23 This suggests that high rents are inhibiting wealth-building among families, since the home is the major source of wealth for most American families.24
These harms to families ultimately translate to harm to the nation. Lower educational achievement and worse health outcomes decrease the level of economic development for the nation as a whole,25 while increasing costs related to addressing poverty and health care.26 In the quest for more affordable housing, families are often forced to live further and further away from work. Longer commutes mean that there is a greater consumption of fossil fuels, which contributes to climate change. We need to address our current housing shortage to build wealth for families and for the nation.
 
 
Policymakers have structured housing policies such that they routinely provide assistance to millionaires for their multi-million dollar homes,27 second homes, and yachts,28 while denying assistance to people living in poverty.29​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities reports that a larger share of federal housing spending goes to the 7 million households with incomes of $200,000 or more than the more than 50 million households with incomes of $50,000 or less.30​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
In addition to the skew in favor of the rich, our federal housing spending privileges homeowners over renters. More than 70 percent of federal housing subsidies go toward homeowners, although renters are more likely to have severe housing cost burdens.31​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ Three-quarters of needy renters receive no federal housing assistance, while all who qualify for homeownership tax breaks receive them.32​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
 
Policymakers need to stop privileging rich homeowners in the nation’s spending on housing and focus resources on middle- and low-income households, where it will do the most good. Senator Elizabeth Warren’s American Housing and Economic Mobility Act (S. 3503) is an important first step toward fully funding affordable housing. The bill calls for $50 billion a year to be invested in affordable housing. This investment will be paid for by returning “the estate tax thresholds to their levels at the end of the George W. Bush administration and institut[ing] more progressive rates above those thresholds.”33​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
While the Warren bill is a good, bold proposal, it is likely insufficient to address the problem fully. The Warren bill will provide about 3 million housing units over 10 years. We currently have a deficit of 7 million units for the extremely low-income, and other trends continue to push rents higher, potentially worsening the situation.34​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
Congress should use the Warren bill as a model, and add $75 billion annually over 10 years to that investment in order to move towardaffordable housing for all. The additional $75 billion would provide enough for an additional 4 million public housing units and address the backlog of maintenance and repairs in public housing, which is conservatively estimated at $50 billion.35​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ This $75 billion plus the level of spending in the Warren bill would make for a total investment of a $125 billion a year.
The additional $75 billion can be secured from tax reforms. An additional $35 billion a year in revenue can be obtained from eliminating the capital gains tax exclusion for home sales. Income from capital should not be privileged over income from work. The remaining $40 billion a year can be generated by repealing the corporate tax cuts in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.36​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ These changes would help to re-balance our housing policy away from subsidizing the richest and toward helping the neediest.
 
 
“Social housing” is a term commonly used for public housing in other parts of the world. Social housing in Europe and Asia, however, is more flexible than U.S. public housing in terms of what entity is responsible for the financing and management of the housing, and the income profile of the tenants. Social housing need not be managed by the government; it can also be managed by non-profit organizations. While it typically receives some government financial support at some time, social housing need not be primarily reliant on the government for operating expenses. One way social housing achieves more financial independence from the government is that it has not been exclusively for poor families. Income from rent often contributes a substantial amount to the management of the housing because significant numbers of non-poor households may also reside in social housing.37​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
Public housing makes up less than 1 percent of the housing stock in the United States,38​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ but social housing is 5 percent in Canada and Germany,39​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ 18 percent in Sweden, 32 percent in the Netherlands,40​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ nearly 50 percent in Hong Kong,41​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ and 80 percent in Singapore.42​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ Unlike public housing in the United States today, social housing is generally viewed positively in the rest of the world.43​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
The more flexible social-housing model would be beneficial to the United States in that it can build a broader base of support for affordable housing for all. Also, since social housing has a more economically diverse range of residents than U.S. public housing, it can be used more effectively to combat the racial and class segregation found in U.S. housing.44​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ At present, the shortage of affordable housing for low-income households is too severe to do much experimentation with mixed-income public housing, but the long-term goal should be to transform public housing in the United States into more European-style social housing.
Some might say that what works in Europe cannot work in the United States. This is not the case. The first iteration of public housing in the United States was essentially social housing. It was built to provide housing for workers, sometimes with the support of labor unions andother groups, in a time of a housing shortage, and households did not have to be poor to reside in the housing. American public housing looked a lot like European social housing prior to the 1950s.45​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
After the 1940s, institutional racism in American society, conservative politicians opposed to the government providing goods and services, and the real estate lobby unwilling to compete with the government for customers, transformed American social housing into public housing reserved for poor people and disproportionately serving African Americans.46​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ This transformation led to less resources for public housing and therefore difficulties maintaining the quality of the housing.
A long-term goal for affordable housing policy should be to reinvigorate social housing in the United States. There should be more experimentation with non-profit management, and more mixed-income tenants in public housing. These experiments should have sufficient regulatory safeguards, including robust enforcement mechanisms and tenant empowerment, to make sure that they serve the public good and are not a vehicle for making the wealthy wealthier. The many different models of providing affordable housing found in Europe, in Asia, and in American history should serve as inspiration for new social housing in the United States.47​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
 
One small step forward to social housing would be for public housing to remove income limits for tenants over time. Our safety net programs, like public housing, punish people if they improve their economic situation.48​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ For example, if someone in public housing obtains a job that lifts her family’s income to the median level, her family can be forced out of public housing.49​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ The forced move to market-rate housing could leave the family worse off financially because of the higher rental costs.
To help tenants build wealth, they must be able to increase their income and their savings while residing in public housing. This approach would also slowly increase the class diversity in public housing and help with the finances of public housing, because tenants with higher incomes would pay higher rents. After 2 years of meeting the income limits for public housing, tenants should be allowed to stay in public housing with incomes up to 110 percent of area median income. Because of the current scarcity of affordable housing, this policy should not be enacted until we have a net increase of the current public housing inventory by at least 4 million.
 
While there is much room for improvement in public housing in the United States, it remains the best way to address the affordable housing crisis today. With public housing, policymakers can determine exactly how many housing units to build and ensure that they are affordable and accessible to low-income households. They can essentially guarantee affordable housing to the most cost-burdened populations. No other affordable housing policy intervention has all of these benefits.50​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
Generally, public housing is misunderstood by the American public. Part of this misunderstanding probably stems from the fact that such a small slice of the American public has had any direct engagement with public housing. Currently less than 1 percent of America’s housing is public housing.51​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ And there have been widely popularized horror stories about large public housing apartment buildings in the United States.
The reality of U.S. public housing, however, is more complicated than the picture painted by these horror stories. First, the public housing that probably comes to mind for most Americans—high-rise apartment buildings—has been in decline since the 1970s. Most public housing projects are composed of garden apartments, low-rise walk-ups, and single-family homes or townhouses.52​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ Public housing can look like any type of housing. Second, most residents of public housing find it to be better than the housing they could obtain in the private market. In 1991, during a period of high crime in America,53​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ 62 percent of tenants who had recently moved into public housing stated that public housing was better than their last home.54​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ Finally, renters in public housing have lower rates of housing cost burden than renters using most other forms of housing assistance. Public housing is superior to Housing Choice Vouchers and the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit in providing affordable housing.55​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ Public housing is a key mechanism for providing affordable housing for all.
Based on the demand for public housing, the current supply is insufficient. The average wait time for public housing is over a year. Most cities have closed their wait lists because they are so long.56​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ Clearly, many low-income renters see public housing as a desirable alternative to their current housing. In spite of the benefits, policymakers have been weakening public housing since the 1950s. Policymakers have let the number of public housing units decline steadily since the mid-1990s. The number of public housing units is at its lowest point in decades, despite population growth and a worsening affordability crisis.57​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
The lack of support and chronic underfunding by policymakers is at the root of many of the problems facing public housing.58​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ There is currently a backlog of maintenance and repairs of at least $50 billion.59​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ We propose that $75 billion annually should be invested exclusively in providing public housing.
 
Our current primary mechanism of providing housing for low-income households—the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC)60​​​​​​​​​​​​​​—is grossly inadequate. Under the program, the federal government provides the tax credits to housing developers, who then sell them to investors. The capital raised from the sale of the credits pays for about 70 percent of the development costs.61​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ In exchange for this subsidy, the developers are supposed to address the country’s affordable housing needs. But they do not, for reasons described below, which is part of the reason why housing cost burdens keep rising.
The LIHTC has been alternatively described as a leaky bucket62​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ and as a ticking time bomb63​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ because the housing units built with the credit are generally only required to be affordable for 30 years—and in some cases, for only 15 years.64​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ This is an early retirement age for housing. Thirty years is less than the median age for America’s private owner-occupied housing stock.65​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ The median age for public housing is over 45 years.66​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ As shown in Figure 1 above, our affordable housing crisis is more than 30 years old. By 2029, we will lose nearly half a million LIHTC housing units due to the expiration of the affordability requirement.67​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ We should not be using a short-term solution to address a long-term problem.
Enacted in 1987, the LIHTC has failed to provide enough affordable housing to reverse the trend of rising rates of housing cost burdens illustrated in Figure 1. Because the LIHTC is a tax credit, there is no societal control over the number of units created. The Great Recession led to a decline in the amount of credits used,68​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 is also expected to reduce the amount used.69​​​​​​​ The credit is designed to meet the desires of wealthy investors, not the needs of people with housing cost burdens.
The LIHTC also does not guarantee that the units constructed with the credit will be affordable to poor households. In fact, a large share of LIHTC residents are still cost-burdened. A majority of LIHTC residents receive an additional form of rental assistance to pay for their housing.70​​​​​​​ In other words, Low-Income Housing Tax Credithousing is generally not affordable to low-income households unless there is a second government subsidy. The LIHTC performs worse than Housing Choice Vouchers and public housing in preventing housing cost burdens.71​​​​​​​
The LIHTC is ineffective and should be ended. The roughly$9 billion annual cost of the program should be transferred to the Housing Choice Voucher program, also known as “Section 8,” which provides a subsidy to households so that they can live in a private rental without paying more than 30 percent of their household income. Because the benefit is given to the household, the Housing Choice Voucher, ideally, can be used to help reduce racial and class segregation and to allow low-income children access to high-opportunity neighborhoods.72​​​​​​​ As with public housing, the demand for vouchers greatly exceeds the supply.73​​​​​​​
 
There is an urgent need for affordable housing. However, it is not possible to build 7 million affordable housing units overnight. Rent control or rent stabilization74​​​​​​​ is an important solution to begin to address affordable housing needs today and to prevent housing cost burdens from worsening.
During a period of scarcity in rental housing, like we are facing today, landlords can raise rents and increase their profits without making any additional investments and without regard to wage growth or stagnation. These higher rents increase the financial hardship for renters without providing any benefits. Rent control policies would prevent this from happening.
By prohibiting rapid rent increases, rent control is an effective measure to prevent displacement and increase housing stability. Stable, affordable housing is associated with improved well-being and higher educational achievement for youth.75​​​​​​​ Policymakers have created policies to benefit homeowners with the justification that there is a social benefit to the housing stability that comes with home-ownership.76​​​​​​​ Rent control achieves housing stability for renters. A recent study of rent control in San Francisco shows that residents in rent-controlled units are less likely to move.77 ​​​​​​​If policymakers wish to stop privileging higher-income homeowners over low-income renters, rent control is one policy they can promote.
Rent control can also be an important component of maintaining class-based diversity in communities. By protecting longer-term residents and lower-income residents, areas with rent-controlled properties can become more socioeconomically diverse. (Formore on the need for and benefits of rent control see Our Homes, Our Future: How Rent Control Can Build Stable, Healthy Communities.)
 
Tenant power is an important resource in maintaining safe, decent, and affordable housing. Landlords unfairly evict tenants so that they can convert affordable housing into housing for the affluent. Even when they do not issue eviction notices, unscrupulous landlords pressure tenants to move by failing to keep up on maintenance and degrading the living conditions in rental housing.78​​​​​​​ In addition to having appropriate regulatory anti-eviction safeguards and enforcement, strong tenant protections and tenant power help prevent low-income renters from being pushed out of affordable housing.
The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) should require states receiving assistance from them to require just-cause evictions. In other words, as Congressman Ron Dellums proposed in 1989, “Grounds for eviction will be restricted to voluntary nonpayment, willful destruction of property, and gross violation of community standards.” Additionally, there should be due process for eviction proceedings,79 and HUD should establish and support a “civil Gideon” or right to counsel for eviction cases.
HUD should also require states receiving assistance from the agency to establish a right to collective bargaining by tenant councils so that tenants have a voice in the management of their housing. If a manager of rental housing fails to provide minimum services, to adequately maintain the property, to treat tenants appropriately, or even to comply with building code regulations, tenants individually have little power to compel the manager to act in a timely fashion. In a period when affordable housing is scarce, landlords can easily evict residents who complain and replace them with some of the many people who are desperate for affordable housing. A tenant council with the right to collectively bargain would establish bargaining procedures to see that landlords properly maintain the property and treat tenants fairly. HUD should support and provide technical assistance to tenant councils.80 With just-cause evictions, a right to counsel for evictions, and a right to collective bargaining, tenants will have the power to require that landlords provide safe and decent housing without fears of eviction.
 
 
 
 
 
The high and rising rates of housing cost burdens are the result of 2 major factors. First, there is an inadequate—and declining—supply of affordable housing. Second, household incomes have grown little since the 1960s, especially relative to the growth in rents.89
Looking again at Figure 1, we can see slight interruptions in the upward movement of the rate of housing cost burdens from 1990 to 2000 and from 2010 to 2016, particularly for the middle quintile and the lower-middle quintile. These interruptions correspond to periods where the national economy approached full employment and wages began to rise. (The country approached full employment by national measures in 2000, and has been trending toward full employment since about 2015.) When more people are working and they are working for higher wages, household income rises and households have more money to dedicate to housing. A broad policy agenda, like that of the Economic Policy Institute’s, can create an American economy of full employment for all90 in good jobs.91
 
The U.S. government actively deprived African-American communities of investment through its redlining policies. Years later, lenders targeted African-American communities for predatory subprime lending that resulted in historic losses of wealth. Policymakers should develop policies to redress the economic harm cause by these discriminatory practices.
Title II of Senator Elizabeth Warren’s American Housing and Economic Mobility Act, “Reversing the Legacy of Housing Discrimination and Government Negligence,” is a promising start.92 This section of the bill has 3 sets of policies to address communities that have faced historic disinvestment. (1) It calls for down-payment-assistance grants to be given to first-time homebuyers who currently reside in low-income communities that were subject to redlining by the federal government. (2) It calls for HUD to assist communities that have not yet recovered from the financial crisis by pursuing loan modifications for borrowers with negative equity; by purchasingvacant, foreclosed property to enhance property values; and by assisting borrowers with negative equity to rehabilitate and keep up with maintenance on their property. (3) It calls for the Community Reinvestment Act to be amended to cover more financial institutions, to promote more investment in poor communities, and to strengthen sanctions against institutions that fail to follow the rules.
 
America is a deeply racially segregated society, and this segregation is to a large degree the result of government action. The government’s role is amply documented in Richard Rothstein’s The Colorof Law. Rothstein even documents a public housing authority that evicted all white families from an integrated development to create a blacks-only project.93 The federal government should pursue integrationist housing policies with the same zeal with which it pursued segregationist housing policy.
One important step in this process would be recommitting to the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule established under the Obama administration. There should be no further delay in applying this rule. The Poverty and Race Research Action Council and other organizations are working to have the rule followed and compliance monitored.
 
Landlords help to maintain America’s race and class segregation in housing by discriminating against renters based on their source of income. Renters who pay their rent based solely on income from work are more likely to be accepted as tenants than renters who use Housing Choice Vouchers and other sources of safety-net income. This practice must be prohibited. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities reports that states and localities with voucher non-discrimination laws are effective at reducing this form of discrimination. These anti-discrimination laws are likely to open up voucher households’ access to higher-opportunity neighborhoods.94
 
There are a number of zoning laws that inhibit the supply of housing and help to facilitate racial and class segregation. Policymakers should carefully review these laws and encourage the removal of those laws that do not serve the creation of safe and socioeconomically diverse communities. Section 2 of Senator Cory Booker’s Housing, Opportunity, Mobility, and Equity Act of 2018 is a good start. Booker linksCommunity Development Block Grant funding to the removal of exclusionary zoning policies. The bill calls for Block Grant recipients to develop a plan to increase the supply of affordable housing by doings things such as authorizing high-density and multi-family developments in more areas, eliminating height restrictions on developments, and streamlining permitting processes.95​​​​​​​",policy-briefs
"Collectively, we can create safe and vibrant communities, provide quality education, and build the buildings, roads and infrastructure our nation needs to continue growing. We can carry out the diplomacy required to build good will and project our values throughout the world, defend ourselves and our allies from threats and respond to emergencies. We can ensure that we all have what we need to thrive and – when times are hard – survive. And a fair tax system is the best way to enact these democratic investments.
In their hastily drafted and reconciled tax bills, donor-driven Republicans in the House and Senate have put forward principles that would instead weaken our country. They aim to redistribute resources back up to powerful, wealthy individuals and corporations. [...]
A Demos study found that the majority of the donor class – without regard to party affiliation – rejects economic policies proven to reduce inequality and strengthen economic opportunity. The sway of donors over several Republicans and the pressure they are exerting to rush the process is subverting our aspirations and values of our nation.
These tax reform proposals test congress members’ mettle – will they be able to stand up to the selfish donors looking to consolidate their power and wealth by sowing divisions?

"A corporation is a legal structure that enables individuals to contribute and pool resources, capital, and labor in order to generate a profit. Corporations are created by state law in the state in which they are incorporated.
The corporate legal structure receives a number of advantages and obligations from the state. These laws enable the corporation to overcome the limitations of any one individual—like a human lifespan or limited productive capacity—and to accumulate and distribute profits among the various stakeholders. 
The term ‘corporate personhood’ has become a shorthand way of disagreeing with the way decisions like Citizens United expanded the First Amendment rights of corporations. The term, however, tends to conflate two distinct legal concepts. 
The first concept, legal personhood, is a doctrine under corporate law that enables a company to be treated as a single legal entity. This doctrine is what enables corporations to enter into contracts, be subjected to state and federal laws, and to sue and be sued. 
The second concept is the notion that corporations have rights protected under the U.S. Constitution. As a legal matter, the Supreme Court has held that corporations do have a number of protected constitutional rights (see below). But, as the popular reaction to Citizens United demonstrates, the scope of constitutional protections that apply to corporations—particularly under the First Amendment—remains highly contested.
The U.S. Supreme Court has held that the Constitution ensures corporations are afforded due process property protections,¹ have the right to trial by jury in a criminal case,² are protected against double jeopardy,³ and cannot be subjected to unlawful searches and seizures.⁴ Beginning in the 1970s, the Supreme Court held that corporations engaging in “commercial speech” are protected by the First Amendment from state interference.5 The origins of many of these rights can be traced to several influential 19th century cases. 
However, because corporate rights limit the ability of the democracy to act, it is important that these rights are not expanded in ways that conflict with other constitutional values.
Since the 1970s, there has been a well-financed movement to extend First Amendment rights to corporations, and subsequent court decisions re-characterized food and safety labels as “corporate speech” and held reasonable labeling requirements unconstitutional. A similar push took place with respect to campaign finance laws, where money in the form of political expenditures re-characterized as speech. Citizens United represents a new high-water mark in this effort to exempt corporations from regulation under a banner of First Amendment rights.
The court decisions that have given corporations rights have relied, either implicitly or explicitly, on one of three major theories of the corporation’s legal status. These theories are in some tension with one another, and each of these theories imagines a very different relationship between corporate power and the democracy:
In recent years, the “Natural Entity” view has found a number of adherents among conservative members of the judiciary. This view has resulted in corporations receiving many of the same rights as individuals and has placed many corporate activities beyond democratic control. 
We need to get back to the simple fact that corporations are institutions created by law, and not naturally occurring entities with inherent, inalienable rights. As Justice Stevens stated in his Citizens United dissent, “Corporations help structure and facilitate the activities of human beings, to be sure, and their ‘personhood’ often serves as a useful legal fiction. But they are not themselves members of ‘We the People’ by whom and for whom our Constitution was established.”
The “State Charter” view of corporations offers a promising alternative the currently dominant paradigm. Unlike the Natural Entity theory, the recognition that corporations are created by state charters would better enable the democracy to set the rules that corporations must follow. As Boston College Law Professor Kent Greenfield recently noted, changes to the corporate form are too often overlooked by democracy advocates.
As creations of state law, corporations could be defined in a manner that is more compatible with democratic governance. Nonprofit corporations, in exchange for the benefits they receive from the state, are limited as to the types of political activity they can engage in. Similar standards could apply to business corporations. Corporations could be reformed to adopt the model of Benefit Corporations (or B-Corps), for example, which are required by law to benefit both society and shareholders and to consider how their decisions affect their employees, community, and the environment. Alternatively, corporate governance could be changed to require greater input from employees and other affected constituencies. In the more inclusive German system, employees are given seats on corporate boards. 
Changes like these would be transformative. So long as individuals’ associational rights are protected, there is no constitutional reason the state should not be permitted to define corporations in such a way that commercial winnings cannot be used to buy outcomes in the political system. That is precisely what we should demand from a private sector that has ceased to work in the public interest. ",research
"Generations of black women have learned to be solution-oriented and resourceful, often ‘making a way out of no way.’ Their political participation is part of a history of survival.
Progressive women of color in the Democratic party have demonstrated the power of their voices as candidates and as voters in recent months. The victories of Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez (New York), Stacey Abrams (Georgia), Deb Holland (New Mexico) and Ayanna Pressley (Massachusetts) have created a new sense of excitement and possibility among Democrats. Abrams and Pressley are especially noteworthy because of the rise of anti-black racism in recent years, and because black women’s ability to participate in our democracy as voters and as candidates for elected office has been severely curtailed by social exclusion.
""If they don't give you a seat at the table, bring a folding chair.""
– Shirley Chisholm, first African-American woman elected to the U.S. Congress (1968)
Decisions, policies, and practices continue to obstruct the civic engagement of black women. For the 68 percent of black women who are paid by the hour, 1 employers’ lack of flexibility on work hours often combines with poor transit service to limit access to polling sites. Certain overly aggressive voter-roll purge policies will disproportionately impact black women, as black households are more likely than the national average to have moved in the past two years and to have moved against their will.2 These and other forms of social exclusion are driven by the economically and politically powerful, and enforced by employers, public officials, and police. Black women made up 6.6 percent of the country’s population in 2016, but only 3.1 percent of federal and state elected officials.3 The social exclusion of black women hobbles our democracy by eroding the social safety net for people of color and working-class communities, and bolstering policies that benefit those with more political and economic power in our society.
Historically, state and federal policy and practice are the means by which the social exclusion of black women has been instituted and perpetuated. For example, women won the right to vote when the 19th Amendment was ratified in 1920, but most black women could not exercise that right because Jim Crow laws—buttressed by racist bureaucrats, police, and vigilantes—blocked African Americans from full democratic participation until the 1960s. Women like Fannie Lou Hamer fought for the right to vote even as they endured assaults by police and mourned national tragedies like the murder of the four little girls who died when the Ku Klux Klan bombed the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama in 1963. During this same period, social workers disrupted black families by threatening to deny Assistance to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) if a man lived in the home of an unmarried mother.4 These experiences fostered distrust and diminished confidence in the role of government as a solution to community problems.
 
In the face of such challenges, generations of black women have learned to be solution-oriented and resourceful, often ‘making a way out of no way,’ and their political participation is part of this history of survival. As elders, black women pass down stories about sustaining a family despite poverty and racism across generations. They share first-hand experiences of the fight to win the right to vote—and the means to exercise that right—and younger women take both lessons and hope as they juxtapose those stories with contemporary experiences of state-sanctioned anti-black racism and the ongoing fight for living wages and affordable health care. Through such experiences, black women have developed a keen power analysis.
In short, people of color and working-class communities have an intimate knowledge of how power and the lack of it shows up in their daily lives. When you talk with low-propensity, low-income women voters about power—what it is, how you get it, and what you can do once you have it—they possess a complete analysis of who holds it and why. When we acknowledge both that black women have been blocked from traditional power because of the intersection of race, gender, and economic disadvantage and the power that black women can build through organizing and voting, those voters begin to connect democratic reform with the bread-and-butter issues that define their daily lives. That connection is a practical analysis, and one that informs the campaign models of black women.
Ayanna Pressley shared, on a recent panel about black women on organizing, voting and winning elections in 2018, that attention to relationships with people across social and economic strata was a critical component of building support for her campaign. The median donation to her campaign was $64, and she received $1 donations from people experiencing homelessness. Further, 250 men in a Massachusetts correctional facility organized their families and friends to vote for Pressley. The lesson was simple: “If you show that you care about people, people will care about democracy.”
One way that we indicate whose concerns we care about is polling. Panelist Latosha Brown, co-founder of Black Voters Matter, warned that “polls are often wrong because they are talking to the wrong people.” Whether to poll on policy priorities—polls that often miss communities without landlines—or to turn out voters, short-form canvassing is less effective in black communities. Black communities’ well-earned skepticism of government means that they are not easily won over by strangers knocking at their door and are less likely to let their guard down for a 3-minute conversation with politicians. Historically, black women have not had the option to vote for candidates who look like them and who share their social and economic concerns. As a result, they have not seen their lives improved by voting as much as white men, black men and white women have.
Black women are often deterred by a number of factors when they decide to run for public office. First, finding donors to support the candidacies of black women is daunting because black women have been excluded from traditional pools of financial support. Wealthy donors who fund political campaigns are not just richer, whiter, and more often male than the rest of us; they also have very different views and priorities, especially about how to structure our economy and how to prioritize the issues that matter most to black women.5
Black women who understand the economic struggles of their community may find it difficult to imagine how to tap their networks to raise thousands of dollars to run for office. Women like Stacy Abrams, who achieve academic and professional success, are often the wealthiest person in their families. As a result, poor and working-class family members “back home” often turn to them in times of crisis. Many black women bear responsibility for their families, often taking care of their children, elderly parents and others in their communities.
Black women also tend to downplay their talents and their existing leadership in their communities, which may look different from the archetypes of leadership associated with political office. Black women often do not see themselves reflected among political leaders because most are white, male and/or affluent. From the county level up to Congress, 90 percent of our elected officials are white (65 percent are white men).6 Each of these factors is a result of social exclusion—racism, sexism and economic injustice codified into laws, practices, and social capital that comprise systemic inequality.
 
Political participation—through voting, volunteering, and seeking public office—is a survival strategy, especially at the local level. While the state of Alabama voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election, voters in the state also elected 9 black women as judges, suggesting the power-building potential of local and state races. This year, black women in Alabama are running for public office in unprecedented numbers, months after political pundits were widely crediting black women voters in Alabama for Senator Doug Jones’ victory against Roy Moore. DeJuana Thompson, founder of Woke Vote and 2018 Demos Transforming America Honoree, began to mobilize millennials and black women because she saw the seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions as an opportunity to elect someone responsive to the needs of black communities. Leading up to the November 2018 election, the groundbreaking candidacies and powerful organizing of black women indicate that voting is a form of civic engagement that reveals our relationship to each other as much as to our democracy.
Relational organizing can help circumvent social exclusion. For example, not long ago a campaign to raise the minimum wage began by canvassing Baltimore beauty salons. Hair salons are both the leading business for black women entrepreneurs and a central spot where women freely talk about family, community, and politics. Once patrons were engaged in conversation about their lives, including economic issues, there was consensus around the problems they faced and the goals of the organizers. That moment of consensus was the point when organizers made clear the connection between lived experience and democracy reform by saying, “Here’s how we build power in our communities.” They used that moment to teach folks how reforms like rank choice voting and democracy vouchers can help them elect politicians who will support policies that advance fair housing, good schools for their children and health care, as well as minimum wage increases that help raise the standard of living in their communities. Civic engagement becomes an expression of relationship, resilience and agency in communities constrained by social exclusion.
Marcia S. Price is a member of the Virginia House of Delegates and the director of the Virginia Black Leadership Organizing Collaborative (VA BLOC), a non-profit committed to increasing African-American civic engagement in the Hampton Roads/Newport News area. At a recent panel about black women’s electoral power, Price noted that people in the communities she serves understand that people gave their lives so that African Americans would have the right to vote, but she finds that the history of voting rights alone is not enough to move them to the ballot box. She paraphrased what she hears from young people: “I respect the fact that someone died so I can vote. But showing me that I was evicted because politicians are more committed to meeting expectations of developers than people like me, that gets me engaged, active and voting.” Making these connections also lays the groundwork for building relationships between and beyond election cycles.
Long-form canvassing and one-to-one organizing—both forms of relational organizing—allow time to identify common experiences and interests and to build a relational foundation based on common goals. Deeper relationships that establish trust and reciprocity are necessary to create an inclusive participatory democracy.
Lastly, if we understand low-propensity voters as people with whom our government has failed to establish fair and equal relationships, then constructive attention to those relationships can point toward new opportunities to build power for communities of color and working-class communities. Black women as voters, candidates and elected officials encourage focus on grassroots organizing. Black women organizers conduct voter education by going to barber shops and beauty salons, churches, community-based clubs and organizations where they listen to the concerns of their communities and center racial equity in reciprocal conversations about democracy reform.

"Floyd v. City of New York is the landmark class action, spearheaded by the Center for Constitutional Rights, that proved the NYPD’s stop and frisk practice was unconstitutional and racially discriminatory. In March of 2015, Demos became co-counsel with CCR on behalf of the Floyd plaintiffs. In that role, Demos is working with the parties, the NYPD and the court appointed monitor to develop reforms to the NYPD’s stop and frisk practice. One major component is direct community input and involvement in shaping how the practices of the NYPD will be reformed.  This is called the “Joint Remedial Process.”
The Joint Remedial Process is a significant process for designing reforms to the NYPD’s stop and frisk practices based on direct input from the people most affected by unlawful and discriminatory stops. We are pleased that the Joint Remedial Process is now getting underway in New York City.
We provide more information about the Joint Remedial Process below. For more information on the Floyd case generally, including information about NYPD reforms being developed outside of the Joint Remedial Process, please visit CCR’s website here.
What is the Joint Remedial Process and why is it happening?
The purpose of the Joint Remedial Process, as stated by the federal court in New York, is to develop a set of reforms with the direct input of the people most affected by the NYPD’s stop and frisk practices. Those reforms will supplement the reforms to policies, training, supervision, discipline, and monitoring currently being developed by the plaintiffs, the NYPD, and the court-appointed monitor in the Floyd lawsuit.
History
In the spring of 2013, the Floyd plaintiffs asked the federal court in New York to order the NYPD to engage in a community input process, called the Joint Remedial Process, with the plaintiffs (that is, the attorneys and clients who brought the landmark Floyd case) and other affected members of the community – particularly those people most heavily impacted by discriminatory policing – to design reforms to the NYPD’s stop and frisk practices. The goal of this process would be to develop meaningful reforms together with direct input from these community stakeholders.
In August 2013, after a nine-week trial, the court found that the NYPD’s practice of stop and frisk was unconstitutional and racially discriminatory and ordered the NYPD to engage in this Joint Remedial Process. In its ruling, the court specifically wrote that meaningful and lasting reform requires the support and involvement of the people most affected. As the court emphasized:
The communities most affected by the NYPD’s use of stop and frisk have a distinct perspective that is highly relevant to the crafting of reforms. No amount of legal or policing expertise can replace a community’s understanding of the likely practical consequences of reforms in terms of both liberty and safety.
. . .
If the reforms to stop and frisk are not perceived as legitimate by those most affected, the reforms are unlikely to be successful. Neither an independent Monitor, nor a municipal administration, nor this Court can speak for those who have been or will be most affected by the NYPD’s use of stop and frisk.
Is the remedial process limited to stop and frisk?
The Joint Remedial Process includes reforms within the Floyd case as well as two related cases known as Davis and Ligon. Both the Davis and Ligon cases challenged NYPD practices beyond stop and frisk. Check here for information about the Davis case and here for information about the Ligon case.
With respect to the Floyd case, the Joint Remedial Process must design reforms to the NYPD’s unconstitutional stop and frisk practice. The range of potential reforms that could come out of the Joint Remedial Process is broad, and under the court’s orders these reforms should supplement the reforms being designed to address failures in discipline, supervision, auditing, monitoring, and other aspects of the NYPD’s operations. That means reforms coming out of the Joint Remedial Process could include changes to, among other things: how the NYPD holds officers accountable for unlawful street encounters, how the NYPD documents stop and frisk activity, what criteria the NYPD uses to evaluate officer conduct, what information the NYPD provides to people who have been stopped, and how supervisors oversee officer behavior. 
What will the Floyd Joint Remedial Process involve?
Retired judge and longtime mediator Ariel Belen has been appointed by the court to work with the parties to design and facilitate the Joint Remedial Process. The design of the process is a work in progress and might change over time.
As of November 2015, the joint remedial process is expected to have four main components:
(1) focus groups of those most affected by the NYPD’s unlawful stop-and-frisk practice;
(2) an advisory committee for Judge Belen and his staff, comprised of community organizations, NYPD leadership, police union representatives, law enforcement officer of color organizations, religious leaders, and academics;
(3) conversations between Judge Belen’s team and  several community leaders on police reform issues; and
(4) structured community forums.
In addition, there will ideally be a mechanism for soliciting input on stop-and-frisk reforms from line NYPD officers. 
What will the focus groups look like?
The focus group piece of the Joint Remedial Process began in late October 2015. We anticipate there will be at least 25 different focus groups. The goal is to draw participants across all five boroughs from 25 NYPD precincts and about 70 neighborhoods— including, to name a few, Melrose, Mott Haven, East Flatbush, Brownsville, Jamaica, Bed-Stuy, and Rockaway Park.
Focus groups will be comprised of eight to ten people who were or are affected by the NYPD’s stop and frisk practices. Participants will be selected in collaboration with community organizations. We are working to ensure that the focus group participants represent a cross-section of those most affected by the NYPD’s practices, including young Black men, LGBTQ youth of color, homeless people, immigrants, public housing residents, and people recently released from prison.
The focus groups are expected to run through early 2016.
What is the purpose of the focus groups?
We are working to ensure the focus groups are designed to solicit input on a central and critical question: what do you – the people most affected by racial profiling and unlawful stop and frisk practices – want the NYPD to change?
We will review the raw data – that is, focus group transcripts and similar materials – from each focus group as they go on. That data will be used to inform the reform proposals that are ultimately included in a report that Judge Belen will submit to the court and court monitor in the spring of 2016.
What is the advisory committee?
Judge Belen has asked a group of approximately 12 people to provide him with non-binding guidance and suggestions on the Joint Remedial Process. This committee, as of November 2015, is comprised of representatives from community organizations, NYPD leadership, police unions, law enforcement officer of color organizations, religious groups, the Department of Justice, and academia. More than half of the representatives are from community organizations. The first convening of the advisory committee occurred at the end of September 2015.  
What else will the Joint Remedial Process include?
In addition to the focus groups, the Joint Remedial Process is expected to include two other structured avenues for obtaining community input into reforms. One avenue is currently being called “leadership meetings.” In the leadership meetings, community organizations who have been leading police reform efforts in New York City will meet with Judge Belen and others to discuss potential reforms. The second avenue will be borough-wide community forums. Those community forums are still in development – that is, Judge Belen and the parties are still working to design what those community forums will look like.  
What will be the outcome of the Joint Remedial Process?
When the Joint Remedial Process ends, Judge Belen will draft a report to the court proposing specific reforms to the NYPD’s practices. The parties – that is, the Floyd plaintiffs and the NYPD – will provide comments to Judge Belen about what reforms he should or should not include in his report. Then, Judge Belen will submit to the court and court monitor his recommendations on what reforms the NYPD should be required to adopt and implement. At that point, the parties could, if they thought it necessary and appropriate, write to the court with comments or objections to what Judge Belen has recommended. The court will then issue an order directing the NYPD to make specific changes based on the Joint Remedial Process.",research
"In Citizens United v. FEC, the U.S. Supreme Court held that corporations were free to use money from the corporation’s treasury on political activity.1 Setting aside for a moment the many criticisms of the decision, Citizens United left open a number of questions about who at a corporation should get to decide when a corporation spends money on politics. It has fallen to our system of corporate law to provide an answer.
Corporations are set up using a legal structure, created by state law, which enables individuals to contribute and pool resources, capital, and labor in order to generate a profit. Corporations are made up of management, a board of directors, shareholders, bondholders, and employees. All of these stakeholders—and society at large—have an interest in how the corporation uses the resources invested. Under existing corporate law, however, the decision to spend money in politics has been entrusted almost entirely to management and directors.2 The shareholder accountability mechanisms that the Supreme Court relied on in Citizens United do not exist in law.
Not really. Current law does not provide shareholders a meaningful opportunity to contest how the money they have invested is spent in politics or whether it should be spent on politics at all.3
Corporate directors do have fiduciary duties that they owe to the corporation and its shareholders. These duties generally require corporate leadership to avoid conflicts of interest and to oversee the corporation’s affairs with care. Because corporate political activities can create reputational risks, diverge from shareholders’ interests, and must comply with any applicable campaign finance laws, political spending should be held to the high standards of fiduciary responsibility.4 However, at present, these duties are unlikely to provide shareholders much recourse, since decisions by management and directors to spend money in politics currently enjoy a high degree of legal deference from courts.5
Shareholders also have a right to vote on a number of matters that affect the corporation, particularly on issues where the interests of managers, directors, and shareholders may diverge. For example, shareholders must approve changes in the articles of incorporation or bylaws and must agree, often by a supermajority (e.g. 75%), before a merger or sale of corporate assets can occur; and, because of Dodd-Frank, shareholders can also vote on executive pay packages, though it is non-binding.
Despite the potential conflicts-of-interest arising out of political spending, shareholders do not currently have a right to vote on corporate political spending under U.S. law. This problem is further complicated by the fact that under current law corporate leadership is not even required to disclose its political spending to shareholders.
Shareholders may seek to introduce proxy proposals, which, if successful, would allow shareholders to request disclosure or ask the corporation to refrain from political activity. Shareholder resolutions relating to corporate political spending are by far the largest and fastest growing categories of proxy proposals.6 At present, proposals on political spending are not binding on management or directors.7 Nonetheless, shareholder proposals have proven an effective way to communicate the importance of the issue and encourage corporations to adopt more transparent and accountable practices.
Managers and directors at several corporations have sought to block these proposals by arguing under Rule 14a-8 that shareholder requests relating to political spending are either vague or are ordinary business decisions that shareholders do not need to be involved in.8 The SEC has rejected both arguments. In a series of “no-action” letters, the SEC has indicated that shareholders could not be denied the opportunity to indicate their views on a corporation’s political spending and made clear that corporate political activity is not an ordinary business decision.9
Corporate law gives other stakeholders in a business, such as bondholders and employees (not to mention the larger community) even less of an opportunity to challenge political spending decisions. These constituencies, under current law, are not owed even the basic fiduciary duties that shareholders are owed, nor do they have any opportunity to vote on corporate policies. This means, to borrow a phrase from Justice Louis Brandeis, that corporate leadership is virtually unchecked in its use of “other people’s money” to engage in corporate political spending.10
One of the ironies of the Citizens United decision is that in attempting to address one First Amendment issue, it gave rise to another. Taking at face value for a moment the idea that money is speech, giving managers and directors unchecked authority over undisclosed corporate political spending should give us pause. Money in a corporation’s treasury is owned by a web of individuals with different legal claims on that money. Corporate managers who choose to spend that money on political expenditures are, under the logic of Citizens United, exercising other individuals’ rights and speaking on behalf of others.
The Supreme Court has recognized that there are important First Amendment interests at stake when one person or group speaks on behalf of another. In the public-sector union context, for instance, the Supreme Court held that union members must be given opt-out rights when the union conducts political activities.11 The Court’s failure to recognize First Amendment opt-out rights for corporate shareholders highlights an important asymmetry in current law.12
This problem is highlighted where corporate political spending is directed to candidates or causes that contradict official corporate policies or which run counter to a company’s long-term interests.13 Investors who want to put their money in businesses whose values they share should have some assurance that a company is not engaging in political spending that runs contrary to those policies. The same can be said of employees who want to invest their time in a corporation whose values they share. Viewed in this light, the real effect of Citizens United was to amplify the speech rights of corporate managers and directors and to weaken the rights of everyone else.
No. Despite a long line of Supreme Court cases stating that disclosure requirements are constitutional, current law does not require management or directors to disclose how they spend corporate money on politics. They are not required to disclose the information either to the public or even to the corporation’s shareholders.
This information is crucial both for citizens trying to make informed decisions about politicians and for investors seeking to make informed decisions about where to invest. Citizens United actually relied on the assumption that corporate political spending would be disclosed. As Justice Kennedy wrote,
“... prompt disclosure of expenditures can provide shareholders and citizens with the information needed to hold corporations and elected officials accountable for their positions and supporters. Shareholders can determine whether their corporation's political speech advances the corporation's interest in making profits, and citizens can see whether elected officials are ‘in the pocket' of so-called moneyed interests.’”14
Yes. Corporate law is becoming increasingly vital to a number of public-interest reforms, and a number of proposals have been made that would help restore a legal balance between corporate leadership, share-holders, and other stakeholders. Imbalances in current corporate law as it relates to political speech could also be addressed by increasing the role of independent directors on corporate boards, requiring approval of a supermajority of shareholders, or otherwise enhancing shareholder involvement in corporate governance. Other corporate stakeholders could similarly be given a larger role in decisions relating to political activity.16
The government could increase transparency and accountability by enacting laws or adopting regulations that would require management and directors to disclose corporate political spending to other stakeholders in the corporation. Disclosure standards could be improved in a number of other ways as well. The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) has the authority to require public companies to disclose their political expenditures and is currently considering a petition, which is now the most commented-on and most supported petition in the agency’s history.17 Congress could fix the lack of transparency immediately by enacting legislation such as the DISCLOSE Act.18 As described above, shareholders may also submit proxy proposals so that they can vote to demand greater transparency from management and directors.19 And the number of companies who voluntarily disclose their political spending continues to grow.20
Because of the important First Amendment values at stake when corporate leadership spends money belonging to a variety of stakeholders, the courts should ensure that corporate law does not simply subordinate the speech rights of these stakeholders to those of managers and directors. Whichever solutions emerge, the need for more transparent, accountable, and representative corporate decision making is nowhere more pressing than when it comes to corporate spending in politics.

"In the first few days of President Trump’s administration, our nation has already seen a direct assault on our democracy. This week, President Trump issued two anti-immigrant Executive Orders, including one on “Interior Enforcement,” which sets forth provisions punishing sanctuary cities that refuse to use their local police to enforce federal civil immigration laws. Let’s be clear: this week's orders are discrimination policies and some of them are unconstitutional. 
In my recent report for Demos, co-authored with Joanna Cuevas Ingram of LatinoJustice PRLDEF, our research found that local police enforcement of federal civil immigration laws may violate the Equal Protection and Due Process rights embedded in our Constitution. We also found that threats to retract federal funding from sanctuary jurisdictions are over-stated, and that state and local jurisdictions have legal leeway to enact various types of sanctuary policies. Unfortunately, the threats summarized in our January 13 report became new federal policies this week, but the legal defenses described for sanctuary jurisdictions are of course still viable.
In the downloadable PDF, I have analyzed Trump’s executive order on Interior Enforcement. In analyzing the provisions of his edict, my comments highlight the legal foundation for local jurisdictions to reject many of the policies set forth in it, as well as their ability continue to provide sanctuary policies that protect and welcome immigrants by refusing to enforce federal civil immigration laws.

"Introduction
In March 2013, acting under a controversial statute that authorized extraordinary action, Michigan Governor Rick Snyder appointed Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr to replace the elected government of Detroit. By July, the emergency manager had filed for bankruptcy of the city.
In November, anticipating a ruling on the largest municipal bankruptcy filing in the country’s history, Demos Senior Fellow Wallace Turbeville published a 70-page report, entitled The Detroit Bankruptcy, challenging the bankruptcy filing and the emergency manager’s central claims regarding the city’s financial situation. Turbeville told the true story of the city’s finances and helped disrupt the perception that the public sector and the relatively modest pay, pensions, and benefits of municipal workers are to blame for the crisis. The report amounted to the first substantial critique, from an expert perspective, of the emergency manager’s appointed mission to take the city through bankruptcy.
Recently, the bankruptcy case shifted in a big way. In December, the judge rejected a settlement made prior to the bankruptcy proceedings by the emergency manager and two banks to resolve a complex financial deal dating back to 2005. This challenge was one of the key recommendations in Turbeville’s report. The banks were forced back to the table.
Then, in February, the emergency manager reversed course completely and filed a lawsuit challenging the validity of the original 2005 deal. Again, this very challenge was recommended in detail by Turbeville in his report. Finally, in April, the bankruptcy court dramatically reduced the amount the city would pay big banks by hundreds of millions of dollars ($85 million down from $230 million), thus freeing up much needed cash to invest back into Detroit.
To date, court proceedings are unresolved as controversies rage on. Every hearing requires the presence of dozens of lawyers representing banks, insurance companies, vendors, retired city workers, citizen groups and the city. Detroit is paying more than $10 million per month on bankruptcy expenses, mostly legal and advisory fees, and the current target for a final resolution is October 2014. If the direct expenses of the bankruptcy continue at the current rate, if this target schedule is met, the city will have incurred around $170 million in costs. The indirect costs, in terms of damage to the already weakened economy of Detroit, are undoubtedly more.
It is true that the city of Detroit’s circumstances are unique and, in some ways, extraordinary. Detroit’s economy has been weak for decades and the population has declined from 1.8 million in 1950 to 700,000 in 2010, leaving a city with a scattered population that is difficult to serve. The city suffered under poor leadership, specifically the administration of Kwame Kilpatrick who resigned in 2008 after 12 years in office, and is now serving 24 years in the penitentiary for corruption. The Great Recession was extraordinarily devastating for Detroit, which has experienced massive numbers of foreclosures and tremendous housing blight.
Nonetheless, Detroit’s experiences are vitally important for many other urban areas in the United States for some time to come. The effects of the Great Recession on city and state governments have been delayed and will linger for years. The following lessons describe some of the factors that can be useful as cities work their way through the fiscal difficulties that will dominate their immediate futures.
The Detroit experience is likely to be echoed for many cities. It presages a number of important issues that will be the center of discussion for any given city, including:
Basic Message: Spending vs. Revenue
In the city of Detroit, the emergency manager was able to create the perception that the city’s travails were a consequence of spending and poor management rather than a decline of revenue sources. This messaging was in his interest in that it enhanced the legitimacy of his position, but it is also reflective of the likely discourse between cities experiencing fiscal difficulties and their state governments. This is heightened by the political and ideological divisions between state and city administrations.
The consequences of the Great Recession are extraordinarily dire for many municipalities. Their tax bases are primarily dependent on real estate (ad valorem property taxes), consumption (sales taxes) and income of urban residents (income taxes).
The effect on real estate taxes has been delayed and will linger because revaluation is a slow process. Declining property values have taken time to work their way through the system and any recovery will be reflected on a delayed basis.
Sales taxes suffer from the same thing that has hampered the entire economy, namely that there has been a de-linkage of corporate profits, reflected in GDP and the stock market, and family incomes important to consumption. Urban incomes have been particularly affected. Similarly, urban incomes have been slower to recover than ex-urban incomes. The highest income cohorts are more likely to live in the suburbs.
This is multiplied by the increasing practice of relying on revenue sharing from the state and transfers from the federal government. Austerity at the federal level and budget squeezes at the state level mean that cities are likely to suffer disproportionately. They are simply at the lowest end of the governmental food chain. Detroit, in particular, was damaged by a substantial reduction in State revenue sharing that kicked in fully in the year preceding its bankruptcy.
These factors were the proximate cause of the Detroit bankruptcy and they are problems for many local governments. The revenue impact of general economic conditions is multiplied because municipal budgets are inflexible. Cash demands for things like debt payments are fixed, and these can make up a large percentage of the budget. Public safety and education are high priorities and they are largely the responsibility of municipalities. Detroit cut its operating budget by 40% in the Great Recession (reducing services to dangerously low levels), but operations were only half of its cast demands meaning that the overall cash demand and was insufficient to make up for the greater than 20% decline in revenue.
Misinterpreted Pension Obligation Numbers
One of the first things that the Detroit emergency manager did was to frame the issue of the city’s pension fund obligations.
The fund trustees had calculated the unfunded obligations at around $800 million using aggressive (in the sense of reducing the number) but not unprecedented assumptions. The emergency manager had the number recalculated using far more conservative (and in fact non-standard in terms of common practice) assumptions.
He published a figure of $3.5 billion and this became the number used in public discourse. The emergency manager also included this number in lists of city debt obligations suggesting that it was comparable to the principal amount of bonds outstanding.
This illustrates a continuing problem of public understanding of unfunded pension liabilities. The obligation to fund future pension payments to employees is real and must be taken very seriously. But it is simply not immediate and the ultimate amount is very uncertain.
If a city’s fiscal position is stressed, it can forego a planned contribution to a pension fund in order to achieve some relief. It is said that this is the same as borrowing at a high interest rate, but that is far too simplistic. It is somewhere in between a borrowing and the deferral of an infrastructure project that could improve the economic health of the city in amounts that are uncertain.
If one wants to discipline a city to make payments into the retirement funds responsibly, the unfunded amount will be presented as large and certain for public consumption. This can easily slip into policy debate suggesting that pension benefits are unfairly high for public workers. In fact, the issue of fairness has to be assessed in the context of the comprehensive public employee compensation. This discussion can easily lead to poor policy decisions because of misinformation and bias based on a desired outcome.
Complex and Risky Financial Transactions
Many municipalities have entered into complex financial transactions that were poorly understood at inception and carry embedded risks that can be realized at times of fiscal stress. This is precisely what happened in Detroit. It had entered into hundreds of millions of dollars of extremely long term interest rate swaps that were subject to immediate termination as the credit of the city deteriorated. Termination required immediate payment of all projected profits that would be earned by the city’s bank counterparties had the swaps not been terminated, common swap termination requirement. The problem was that payment of these projected profits in a lump sum would make the cash flow position of the city completely untenable.
While derivatives such as interest rate swaps are common and risky, municipal finance is notorious for other forms of complex transactions. The simple fact that the interest on municipal debt is exempt from federal income taxation provides tremendous opportunity for complexity. Moreover, for political and governance purposes, municipalities often work through independent or affiliated authorities and agencies that are authorized to issue their own debt. This further adds to complexity.
Municipalities need to have an informed analysis of the risks associated with their capital financing structures. Financings are generally done one at a time with insufficient consideration of the overall set of risks taken on by the municipality. In addition, at the time of the financing, the party that is best positioned to understand the risks of the financing is most often the bank selling the idea to the municipality that is incented to make certain the deal goes through. This is true even when the municipality has an outside advisor because the level of sophistication of the banks so far exceeds that of the advisory profession. This analysis is also not accomplished through the audit process, which proceeds according to rules that could not possibly accommodate disclosure of complex risks.
Economic Development
Detroit, like many cities, gave large incentives such as tax breaks to procure investment in the downtown area. In times of stress, the overall effectiveness of such incentives can become a tremendous concern. Often, this is a legitimate criticism. Understanding what has worked to accomplish the policy goals and what has not is a difficult and perhaps impossible task. Moreover, whether or not the endeavor has had the hoped for simulative effects, public opinion will be suspicious of the potential for prior crony capitalism.

"The Congressional Progressive Caucus’ 2017 People’s Budget tackles inequality head-on, rewriting the rules of a rigged economy so that corporations pay their fair share and the infrastructure and programs that serve the people are well resourced. This budget is a blueprint for America to boost access to good-paying jobs for all, enable every public college student to graduate free of debt, and support opportunities for women and workers of color to rebuild our communities while protecting the planet.
President Trump and some congressional Republicans’ plans, on the other hand, set America back. Even after the recently approved spending bill, they still want to spend billions building a border wall that divides us, ransacking our environment, and endangering working families’ livelihoods and communities’ economic security.
JOBS
As Trump tries to strip away worker protections, the People’s Budget strengthens working Americans’ chances to get a fair share of the economic prosperity they helped create. The People’s Budget raises the federal minimum wage, updates overtime pay regulations, guarantees basic benefits like paid sick time and paid family leave, and strengthens workers’ rights to join together in unions and bargain collectively for a better deal in the workplace.
DEBT-FREE COLLEGE
The People’s Budget addresses the primary cause of the college affordability crisis—state budget cuts—by creating a federal-state partnership guaranteeing a debt-free pathway for students at public colleges and universities.
INFRASTRUCTURE
The People’s Budget lifts America’s infrastructure into the 21st Century, emphasizing investments in meeting our critical transportation needs, replacing crumbling pipes, and updating our energy grid while increasing real employment opportunities for underemployed workers, particularly women, and workers of color, to rebuild America. President Trump and congressional Republicans’ proposals, in contrast, gift millions of dollars to big banks and corporations to build the projects they choose and hand that bill to working households. 
ENVIRONMENT
The People’s Budget accelerates an American clean energy transition and clean economy transformation, centered on supporting our most environmentally vulnerable communities. The People’s Budget holds corporate polluters more accountable to pay for the mess they’ve created.",research
"An outline of Demos' approach to engaging across climate and equity issues and their respective fields.
Even as scientists have long held a consensus on human-caused climate change, the responses of many governments and much of the private sector to accelerating climate change impacts and risks have been dangerously inadequate. A historically high-emitting wealthy country like the United States is especially culpable and a focal point for advocacy: Proposed U.S. emissions targets, let alone actual emissions reductions, fall well short of what is needed. Advocates and activists have increased concern about the climate crisis among a growing majority of Americans, yet translating that popular concern into federal—and even state—policy action has faced significant opposition from the fossil-fuel industry and others with financial incentives to maintain the status quo.
The 2017 hurricane season underscored the urgency of addressing climate change and its associated environmental, economic, and social crises. Southeast Texas faces as much as $190 billion in damages, and Puerto Rico faces more than $100 billion in damages from the hurricane season (an amount roughly equal to the island’s entire annual Gross Domestic Product). But 2017 could very well be dwarfed by much larger impacts within the next several decades. At current rates of warming, for instance, hurricane damages in Miami-Dade County could reach $3.5 trillion by 2050, and the Plains states are predicted to face a multi-decadal megadrought between now and 2050.1
Climate change fundamentally threatens our economy. Without aggressive action, health problems and other productivity decline caused by higher temperatures will reduce U.S. economic growth an estimated 36 percent by the end of the 21st century.2  This does not even account for the accelerating costs of severe weather, rising sea levels, and other environmental impacts of climate change.
Although climate change affects us all, the impacts are not shared equally. For the poorest residents of the most vulnerable regions, climate change impacts—such as, severe weather damage, sea-level rise, and the effects of escalating heat such as draughts, wildfires, and concentrated “heat islands” concentrated in urban areas—exacerbate decades of over-exposure to fossil-fuel pollution from vehicles and power plants, and to other pollution or toxins from industry, waste management, aging water systems, and other sources. High rates of asthma, heart disease, and cancer are endemic in the most polluted communities, due largely to discriminatory policies and planning, with the effect—and often the intent—of ensuring that low-income communities of color bear much of the brunt of the fossil-fuel economy’s vast pollution and waste, while affluent white communities are generally spared. These pollution impacts compound socio-economic disadvantages borne of decades of public disinvestment, government-promoted segregation, inequitable economic development, and gentrification.
At least since Hurricane Katrina, severe weather in the South and elsewhere has put a spotlight on the regressive socio-economic distribution of climate change impacts. It has also shed light on how climate change and inequality are interconnected in the social structure of our economy, especially by race and class. These seemingly parallel crises mutually reinforce the oppression of people of color, as the most economically vulnerable communities suffer the most from climate change impacts on every level.
Yet the interconnectedness of climate change and inequality could also be the source of strength for popular resistance to this destructive status quo. If the social change sector can align climate and equity in terms of movement goals, public policy, and political strategy, we could create a new and wider path for rebuilding progressive power over the next decade. That power, in turn, can break the grip of corporate polluters and the long history of environmental racism at the center of climate change impacts today.
The conversations and relationship-building that will be necessary to achieve such a transformative result are already happening in many places, but there is much work to be done. In what follows, Demos outlines our approach to engaging across climate and equity issues and their respective fields. We hope this can be a useful starting point for the work of building partnerships, collaborations, and broader alignment in these critical times.     
Demos is known for developing policies and waging advocacy campaigns on racial and economic justice issues, as well as democracy issues, often in close collaboration with state and local partners. During the Obama years, as federal climate policy finally seemed to be getting real traction, Demos and others in the racial and economic justice field were increasingly hopeful that a new opportunity was emerging to forge a first-of-its-kind, politically potent alignment between climate and equity issues. This hope is what brought Demos into the work we are outlining here.
Demos recognizes that the climate crisis also presents an opportunity to address another major crisis in our society: rising inequality with deepening racial divides. The key to this opportunity is investment: Getting to zero emissions will require trillions of dollars in new investment to decarbonize key sectors of our economy, including the power sector, transportation, residential and commercial buildings, industry, and agriculture. The critical question for seizing the opportunity presented by climate change is who will benefit from the new investment?  
Much is at stake from a standpoint of racial and economic justice. The fossil fuel economy has proven doubly harmful to low-income communities and especially communities of color. Environmental health impacts from extracting, producing, distributing, and combusting fossil fuels have disproportionately affected communities of color, with significant consequences for residents in terms of well-being, longevity, and economic opportunities. At the same time, the structure of fossil-fuel dependency has concentrated the economic benefits of energy generation and distribution in the hands of the few, and a whole battery of related discriminatory policies have made it virtually impossible for most people of color to reap fair benefits from the fossil-fuel driven economic growth that made America rich. While fossil-fuel companies have been able to buy greater access to politicians and other policymakers, the communities most impacted by the ills of fossil-fuel use have far less access to the halls of power.
In the long run, winning the climate change fight equitably means fundamentally remaking the rules of the system along at least 3 critical dimensions: regenerative energy infrastructure, inclusive democracy, and an equitable economy. Instead of an extractive energy system that’s destroying the planet, we need policies, rules, and investment to fully develop a regenerative energy system, one that fuels the present equitably and sustainably while preserving a healthy environment for the future. Instead of a plutocracy forged by money in politics and voter disenfranchisement, an inclusive democracy would equalize access to and influence on politicians and policymakers, so that the people most impacted by fossil-fuel emissions and climate events have equal footing with those who benefit from fossil-fuel pollution. An equitable economy not only protects the most affected communities from further harms, but also seeks to improve the living standards and well-being of those communities in ways that repair previous damage while creating new and better opportunities for the future.
 
Existing research suggest that the most promising areas for achieving zero emissions are energy efficiency, renewable energy expansion, and vehicle electrification, including mass transit. Broadly defined, the combined energy, transportation, and efficiency service sectors comprise a valuable opportunity for new investment in our economy, for local economic growth, and for future job growth. For instance, researchers at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst estimate that if New York State fully committed to achieving its stated clean-energy standard of 50 percent renewable energy by 2030, the state’s communities and residents would enjoy approximately $31 billion in new investment annually between 2021 and 2030.3 Expanding mass transit, according to one modelling experiment, is projected to increase economic growth in metropolitan areas by as much a $1.8 billion annually, depending on the size of the area.4 This does not even account for how public transit improvements offset the external public health costs of vehicular traffic, generating savings roughly equal to the cost of the improvements, according to one study of public transportation in Germany.5 As for future jobs, by 2017 the energy efficiency sector alone supported 2.2 million jobs—10 times more jobs than oil/gas drilling and 30 times more than coal extraction. Such impressive job growth seems likely to continue, given that energy efficiency is in fact America’s “largest energy resource,” contributing more to our energy needs than any of our fossil-fuel sources.6
In addition to the fundamental changes in energy, transportation, and other sectors needed to reach zero emissions in the country, in the Gulf South and other regions more exposed to extreme weather and other immediate climate change impacts, significant investments in equitable recovery and flood protection strategies are crucial for the most vulnerable communities, many of which are communities of color. As Gulf Coast climate victims can attest, disparities in political power, particularly by race and income, consistently lead to unequal outcomes in the wake of environmental disasters. Advocates for the most vulnerable communities rightly insist that empowering these communities to engage effectively in the policy development and decision-making that typically determine recovery and adaptation strategies is essential for promoting equity. In the longer term, this empowerment can not only advance equitable recovery and adaptation to climate change, it can also intersect with and strengthen community strategies for inclusive economic development. Reforming zoning and land-use policies in ways that reduce, instead of reinforce, racial inequities in a region could be one such strategy. Another example could be using equitable flood-protection planning in hurricane-prone areas as an anchor for broader community resiliency strategies and infrastructure investment. Climate-vulnerable communities that are heavily dependent on fossil fuel-related jobs face the hardest challenge of all, requiring more comprehensive approaches that promote more sustainable and equitable models of economic development. The scale of such challenges should encourage, not deter, comprehensive action, or we run the risk of leaving millions of people in hundreds of communities even further behind in the battle against climate change.           
The need for inclusive and equitable economic development in response to climate change is urgent, for two reasons. First, the chance to make this change is time-bound by accelerating climate risks. Second, getting to zero emissions would be a “general purpose” transformation in our economy, meaning that the combined clean economy investments will establish a fundamentally new foundation for the economy as a whole: an economy that is non-extractive, decarbonized, and sustainable within planetary boundaries as determined by science. The transformation we need, on the timeline we need, depends on rapid, large-scale, acceleration of clean energy investment, far beyond current investment levels. 
As with other general purpose transformations, such as the information technology revolution, the federal highway system, or the national electrical power distribution system, the clean economy transition is a collective good and has to be driven primarily by new public investment. This contrasts with a market-centered model dependent on generating profits for owners, which would exclude too many people and places from access to the clean economy and thereby undermine emissions goals. Public investments of this kind do not go on forever but rather come in waves, as the larger political economy struggles to reorganize itself in response to major social, technological, and, in this case, environmental challenges. This is why it is so urgent for equity advocates to get organized around climate policy wherever it is getting traction. When it comes to demanding the large-scale investments we need and determining where the money is invested and who benefits, officeholders in many states (and certainly nationally) will pay no real attention to equity unless we make them pay attention, whatever that may take.
Getting to zero emissions economy-wide will create many new jobs, especially in high-population areas where emissions reductions should be a priority. The University of Massachusetts study cited above finds that the investments needed to put New York State on a pathway to zero emissions will support between 145,000 and 160,000 jobs each year over the first decade, while projected job losses in the state’s fossil fuel-related industries are estimated to total about 13,400 overall. The new clean energy jobs in New York will pay on average between $63,000 and $114,000 per year.7 A similar policy in Washington State is projected to support somewhere between 36,000 and 41,000 jobs annually over a decade (against job losses totaling about 5,400).8 One study estimates that by 2030, implementing a suite of 9 energy-efficiency policies (led by residential retrofits) across the South will create approximately 520,000 jobs in the region.9  Previous national research found that $200 billion in annual clean energy investments will create 2.7 million net new jobs over a two-decade period.10
To seize the opportunities afforded us by the investments needed to reduce emissions and to protect against climate risks, Demos is enthusiastic about working with state-based partners to make the economic case for equitable climate policies. We recognize that policy approaches may vary from state to state, depending on regional and local factors. Job creation impacts, too, will vary by region. In all of this, we are primarily interested in exploring how policies and programs can target resources to ensure that people of color will see a fair share of the economic benefits of the clean energy transition—both in terms of jobs and the quality of the infrastructure in their communities.     
Many proponents of climate policy reform have appealed to a sense of inter-generational equity, but intra-generational equity is even more urgent. Equitable climate policy must ensure immediate net benefits for people living in polluted communities. Other pollutants released during the burning of fossil fuels and chemical-intensive industrial activities (or co-pollutants), which generally affect local health more directly than greenhouse gas emissions, must be mitigated side-by-side with greenhouse gases. The opportunity to address climate change will be only partly realized without this dual approach.
These co-pollutants—particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, smog-causing nitrogen oxide, and other air toxins—have dramatic negative health impacts:
On efficiency grounds, climate policy should seek to maximize social welfare benefits. Attending to opportunities for greater co-pollutant reductions would maximize a policy’s potential health benefits—in terms of both health outcomes and health-care spending. In terms of equity, the policy should reduce disproportionate pollution in disadvantaged communities, which have been historically overburdened.
To illustrate the importance of taking differences in abatement benefits across emissions sources into consideration, consider the case of 2 facilities in California: a power plant located outside Bakersfield, and a petroleum refinery located in metropolitan Los Angeles. Each emits roughly 3 million tons per year (t/yr) of CO2. The power plant near Bakersfield emits about 50 t/yr of particulate matter and has fewer than 600 residents living in a 6-mile radius. The LA refinery emits about 350 t/yr of particulate matter and has about 800,000 residents living within a 6-mile radius.15 A policy that addresses co-pollutants would clearly provide many more health benefits and generate a significantly more equitable outcome.
 
In developing our climate equity research and campaigns for the coming 2 years, Demos is drawing upon the insights and learnings of partners and allies, the literature in the field, and our own policy experience, strategic orientation, and sense of mission. This has involved conducting landscape interviews with more than 30 leaders in the field, including environmental justice leaders. Demos staff have also participated regularly in the 100 Percent Network learning calls and in major activist forums for climate advocacy and climate equity, including the Building Equity and Alignment initiative and the New Economy Coalition. In addition, our deep involvement in the New York Renews coalition has afforded us a great example of cross-sectional collaboration and movement-building in an intensive live campaign.  
In order to achieve climate equity, we need a people-led policy development process and political strategy. Who should lead, what solutions to fight for, where to fight, and how to win—these are the questions that Demos is considering as we determine our best contribution to the movement for climate equity as a national ally of frontline leadership. Yet we also recognize that it is no less important to be intentional about how we do our work. We believe that the “how” of the work flows together with everything else to make it possible for real, lasting change.
 
State and local politics, based on community organizing, is the critical battleground for winning progressive change on many issues, including at the national level. In this respect, we have developed extensive state-level experience that will inform our climate equity work. As a national group, we avoid top-down strategies and instead take an approach of supportive partnership in state and local fights. The template for this approach is Demos’ Inclusive Democracy Project (IDP), which we launched in 2015 to support racial, economic, and gender justice organizations to play leadership roles in democracy reform efforts across the country. Representing communities that are deeply affected by the influence of money in politics and by voter suppression, Demos’ IDP partners work to organize democracy-reform policy campaigns led by community members. The goals are to lift up people of color as critical agents in reforming our democracy and to wage grassroots fights for policy reforms that make our democracy more representative from a standpoint of racial, class, and gender equity. Currently, Demos has 24 partnerships in 12 regionally-diverse states (see Appendix A for the full list of our partners). The 2018 victory for public financing of elections in Washington, D.C.—won by a coalition led by people of color and supported by Demos in pivotal ways over 2 years—epitomizes the grassroots-empowerment approach of Demos’ IDP work.   
We support our partners in a variety of ways, including research and policy development, campaign support, litigation, peer-to-peering learning, and strategic communications. These are not transactional relationships on one issue or one campaign, but deeply-rooted and sustained relationships, spelled out in most cases by detailed memoranda of understanding. Demos also regrants or guides substantial resources to our partners, to enable them to participate effectively in building local and statewide movement infrastructure and campaigns. 
Our climate equity partnerships will likely overlap with our IDP cohort in some geographies, while we will work to build new relationships in other places. Ideally, all of our climate equity partnerships will be forged in geographies and circumstances that promise significant opportunities for building new alignments and power at the intersection of climate and equity issues, even in some places where major political victories are out of reach in the near term.
 Demos has been working in close, active partnership as a member of the New York Renews coalition, supporting in multiple ways its campaign for equitable statewide carbon pricing. We are also developing new partnerships in the very different political geographies of Texas and Florida, where we intend to invest in long-term relationships. Both of these climate-vulnerable states have massive potential for climate equity movement-building linked to strengthening the voting power of people of color and young people, and Demos is well-positioned to help our partners build new regional and statewide infrastructure for climate-action advocacy centered on racial justice and democratic empowerment. 
To some extent, this movement-building can enhance the hurricane recovery and adaptation work that our partners in both states are already involved in. The key is to link and help empower grassroots, people of color-led organizations and constituencies by centering climate goals in a larger fight for racial and economic justice. The core question, then, is how addressing climate change can empower communities and enable them to thrive. Thanks in part to our support, our partners can credibly answer that question by equipping the most impacted communities and previously excluded constituencies to lead and win on climate action. In addition to our current work in New York, Texas, and Florida, other potential geographies for engagement include the Northeast and the Midwest.
 
Inequitable policies and investments in yesterday’s technologies have long put communities of color directly in the line of impact. Transportation planning that disproportionately exposes low-income communities to heavy truck traffic drives up asthma and cardiovascular disease rates. Petrochemical corridors in the South and elsewhere produce exponentially higher cancer rates in nearby communities compared to national averages. Climate events uproot and displace communities already struggling with poverty and economic injustice. And fossil-fuel extraction and pipelines pollute Native lands and threaten Native livelihoods every day.16
Unsurprisingly, these communities have long led the fight on environmental and racial justice issues. Demos recognizes this historic and continuing legacy by advocating for a leadership approach that puts frontline communities at the center of climate policy development and advocacy. With these frontline communities in the lead, the process to achieve climate equity will model the outcomes we seek.
At the same time, winning on climate equity cannot depend only on the leadership of frontline communities. Victory will also depend on building wider and deeper connections between environmental justice groups, green, labor, and non-climate racial justice groups (with whom Demos is especially allied). The Building Equity and Alignment initiative and statewide coalitions like New York Renews and the Washington Alliance for Jobs and Clean Energy are already modeling this approach. But much of the wider environmental sector lacks the intersectional movement infrastructure to engage a broad-based coalition fight on climate and equity alike. 
 
Demos sees the ideal solutions to the climate crisis at the intersection of limiting fossil-fuel extraction and pollution to slow climate change and reduce its impacts, and ramping up climate solutions that equitably distribute millions of good jobs of the future, stabilize our nation’s long-term economic outlook, and stimulate equitable investments in the places that need investment the most.   
We do not come to this effort promoting one-size-fits all policy solutions. Rather, our work is to support state and local leaders in developing their own platforms based on their own needs. Demos can be there to provide technical support on policy ideas, as well as research to build the case for the best ideas. 
Our analysis also points to the necessity of structural reforms to our democracy, to provide substantial checks on the conversion of economic power into political influence. Reclaiming our democracy for all of us will be vital to winning climate equity solutions. This is why the significant untapped voting power of people of color in climate-vulnerable states like Texas and Florida is an important factor in Demos’ climate equity work.    
 
Demos has a unique range of competencies: coalition building, campaigning, policy development, policy and strategic research, legal strategies, and communications. As we work with our state and local partners, we look for opportunities to leverage these capacities in order to win. For our climate equity work, we expect to follow a similar model to our Inclusive Democracy Project, in which Demos demonstrates our commitment to creating deep relationships with state-based racial justice organizations in order to align around a strategic approach and build toward long-term goals. This approach has proven effective in our work with the New York Renews coalition. 
Transitioning to a low-carbon economy means trillions of dollars in new investment and new savings from averted climate costs. In order to make the case for equitable climate action, we will prioritize the economic, health, and wealth benefits of targeting the most impacted communities. This puts us squarely on a positive footing in the fight to address climate change, which is important for developing the broader advocacy alignment we need to win the fight politically.  
Most essential is the need to create real and sustainable power behind a common strategy for climate and equity goals. To build such power, the leadership, the decision-making, the narrative, and the resources all need to be rebalanced in support of grassroots empowerment led by those who are the most impacted by fossil-fuel pollution and climate change, especially people of color. Leveraging climate policy as a cross-sectoral issue presents an opportunity to build new political alignments that bring labor, environment, environmental justice, and racial justice partners together to alter the political landscape in ways that open opportunity for progressive movement-building and policy victories in the future.
 
Wherever possible, policies that serve both emissions goals and equity goals should be favored over those that do not. When it comes to a tax on carbon emissions, for example, Demos supports a “revenue positive” approach emphasizing community investment. This contrasts with “revenue neutral” approaches that use carbon pricing revenue to pay for other tax cuts or for universal individual rebates. Most of the revenue should be used for community-centered investments that reduce emissions while creating jobs and improving health at the community level. This example should not be taken to suggest that Demos supports carbon pricing schemes (particularly cap-and-trade) uncritically; in most contexts we would only advocate for a tax on carbon emissions if equity-oriented state and local partners and allies have embraced the idea on their own. Environmental justice critiques of carbon pricing schemes, partly based on mounting empirical evidence of policy failures at multiple levels, are an essential counterweight to uncritical and untested assumptions about market-based mechanisms as a driver of lower emissions, let alone of equitable emissions reductions. 
At the state level, there is significant regional variation in policy needs based on varying energy mixes and types of exposure to climate change. For example, while some coastal states have to deal with extreme and escalating Atlantic storm systems, others face more discrete climate challenges such as ocean acidification, which is threatening fisheries in New England and the Northwest. Many interior states may face severe weather and be threatened by drought and negative health impacts from extreme heat. Different states also have different starting points in their reliance on fossil fuels. States that are currently highly reliant on fossil fuels will, in some cases, be slower to adopt strong clean-energy standards compared to states like New York and Washington, which already enjoy a much smaller per capita fossil-fuel footprint. 
Every state will need to have its own unique policy blueprint for how it can contribute on climate change while also helping residents enjoy the benefits of a transition to clean energy and a low-emissions economy. Places already getting hit by massive climate impacts regularly, such as the Gulf Coast states, are likely to put more emphasis on hurricane recovery and climate change adaptation policies, while states less immediately exposed to the worst impacts, or that have lower emissions levels, may focus more on bold mitigation policies. Advocates and leaders in Plains states that rely heavily on fossil fuel extraction may focus on anti-extractive regulations as their first line of defense. 
We do not attempt to propose a detailed policy outline in this short paper, but it may be useful to start the conversation with a basic breakdown of policy categories. More detailed explanations of some of the key policies in each of these categories can be found in Demos’ two major 2018 policy books, Everyone’s Economy (federal), and Everyone’s America (states).17
In all of these categories, policies should be developed from the “bottom up,” informed by and in some aspects led by community leaders in the most impacted communities. Community leadership, local knowledge, political transparency, and government accountability are some of the key procedural criteria for a just transition to a clean economy. Demos has considerable policy development capacity to support state and local partners in creating their own distinctive policy platforms. 
We can also work with partners to produce research that helps them build a powerful case for the policies they are fighting for. Demos can focus on positive impacts like job creation, low-income energy savings, public health co-benefits, and community wealth-building. Estimating the social costs of inaction on climate change is important alongside the positive story, but less salient for mobilizing action. Other research ideas include net-cost analyses of carbon tax proposals, where positive benefits are netted out of expected consumer costs, to provide a “true-cost” estimate of policy impacts. This type of analysis can help offset right-wing fear-mongering about  economic “costs” of environmental policy. Energy efficiency audits to estimate untapped potential in the residential sector can help drive more resources in that direction.
Demos’ approach to climate equity work is informed by our fundamental racial justice analysis, work in the economic justice and democratic empowerment landscape, and experience building deep partnerships with state-based organizations and national groups. Through our relationships, we have determined that our capacities to support intersectional movement-building across climate, economic justice, and democracy issues will complement the current field. We have found that our partners share our analysis: The urgent need to address climate change provides an opportunity to re-create our economy to be more inclusive as it becomes more innovative and responsible.   
There are still challenges in getting people mobilized in support of climate action, even though a majority agree that human-made climate change is taking place. It remains too easy to despair in the face of the climate crisis: Climate events have certainly exacerbated racial inequality, and political inaction to date seems clearly tied to the economic influence of a fossil-fuel industry not afraid to donate big bucks to gain access to decision-makers. 
So our animating question is: How can we help convert “climate change” into an issue that builds the power to ensure that climate action will be timely, equitable, and reparative? In particular, how can we help ensure that specific policies and programs will repair, nourish, and protect those communities that have borne the brunt of fossil-fuel pollution over time?
Connecting climate action to equity, jobs, health, and innovation is likely to be the best way to excite a majority of people to take action. But this doesn’t mean that winning on climate by centering the fight on equity is anything close to automatic. This is why Demos is committed to working with our partners and allies to ensure that the leadership of the climate equity movement be the people of color, young people, and frontline communities who are most impacted.
Fighting climate change is important in its own right; however, availing our nation of the reparative opportunity for people of color and the country as a whole is righteous. The heavily extractive type of capitalism that took root in the United States was always unsustainable, and now it is threatening catastrophe in many forms. Because of racist policies and practices, people of color have borne the brunt of the extraction while enjoying few of the economic benefits. Climate equity is a big opportunity, in concert with other justice fights, to repair some of the damage and begin to set things right.

"A number of states have laws demanding potential voters prove they are citizens to register to vote.
In 2008, as the state of Missouri was poised to adopt a constitutional amendment to require documentary proof of citizenship of every person wishing to register to vote in the state, the New York Times and other media outlets reported on the story of Lillie Lewis. The 78-year old Ms. Lewis, an African American Missourian, was born in Mississippi and had voted in every presidential election she could remember but had no documentary evidence of her U.S. citizenship. As the Missouri amendment was being debated, she wrote to the vital records office in Mississippi seeking a copy of her birth certificate. In response, she received a letter stating that the state had no record of her birth. After decades of voting, she effectively became a non-citizen, excluded from engaging in the voting process that defines a democracy.
Although the amendment failed a vote in the Missouri Senate, a number of other states have passed similar laws demanding that citizens produce documentary evidence of citizenship in order to register to vote. On August 25, 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit heard oral arguments in the latest case testing how far such laws can go.
The case, captioned Kobach, et al. v. Election Assistance Commission, et al., began as a challenge by the states of Kansas and Arizona to the federal Election Assistance Commission’s  voter registration application form (known as the “federal form”).1  Under the National Voter Registration Act (or NVRA), the EAC issues the federal form and is largely responsible for the form’s design and content. However, the federal form may require only information that is necessary for the states to assess voter eligibility.  The form already includes requirements that each registrant both must check-off a box that states s/he is a U.S. Citizen and must sign, under penalties of perjury, that s/he is a U.S. citizen. Kansas nevertheless requested that the EAC add instructions to the federal form requiring Kansas residents using the form to submit documentary evidence of citizenship, as the state required for its own voter registration forms. Arizona and Georgia, which also have documentary proof-of-citizenship requirements for their state voter registration applications, joined in Kansas’s request. The states argued that documentary proof-of-citizenship is necessary for them to enforce the requirement that their voters be citizens.  
The EAC refused to change the instructions on the federal form because the proposed requirement would impose unnecessary obstacles to voter registration for many citizens. Kansas and Arizona then sued the EAC, arguing that the refusal was “arbitrary and capricious.” The District Court in Kansas agreed with the states and ordered the EAC to modify the federal form, but the Tenth Circuit has prevented the District Court’s order from going into effect while it considers an appeal of the District Court’s decision.
This case has far-reaching implications for voter participation in our democracy because it thwarts so many individuals from registering to vote and therefore voting.  In 2004, Arizona was the first state to impose a documentary proof-of-citizenship requirement on its voters, and Kansas passed its proof-of-citizenship law in 2011.  Alabama recently joined them, and Tennessee and Georgia have passed similar laws in recent years.  In these states, politicians who benefit from reduced voter participation see documentary proof-of-citizenship requirements as a potent tool in their own self-interest and by cloaking these anti-voter policies as a solution to “voter fraud,” are increasingly able to find support for them in state legislatures.  
 
States already ask for evidence of citizenship. Since states began requiring voters to register prior to voting, every state has required individuals wishing to register to sign a statement under penalty of perjury affirming that they are citizens and that they meet all of the state’s other voter eligibility requirements. The federal form also requires such a statement and additionally states that non-citizens who register may be criminally prosecuted and deported. 
Statements under penalty of perjury are acceptable evidence in courts of law, and for many decades every state in the nation accepted them as evidence of citizenship for voter registration purposes. What is new is that a handful of states are no longer accepting such statements and are demanding that voters instead provide documentary evidence of citizenship, such as birth certificates, naturalization cards, or Native American tribal documents.  
These states insist that requiring such evidence is necessary to ensure that non-citizens do not fraudulently register to vote—something that occurs extremely rarely, if at all.  In fact, these laws prevent numerous eligible voters from registering simply because they do not have an acceptable document showing their U.S. citizenship.  At the same time, documentary proof-of-citizenship requirements do no more to prevent voter registration fraud by non-citizens than the threat of criminal prosecution and deportation has done ever since states began registering voters.  Preventing legitimate voters from participating in our democracy is an unacceptable price to pay for stopping at most a tiny number of fraudulent voter registrations.
 
No.  Many eligible voters lack documentary evidence of their citizenship sufficient to satisfy state proof-of-citizenship laws. Those most likely to be affected by these laws are students, the elderly, the disabled, low-income individuals, the homeless, and naturalized citizens. Aside from these narrow populations, across the board, Native Americans, African Americans and members of other historically disadvantaged and disenfranchised groups are also less likely to have, or have ready access to, documents that will satisfy documentary proof-of-citizenship requirements.
Birth certificates, the most widely recognized documentary evidence of citizenship, pose a number of problems for many individuals. Many elderly people and those born at outside of hospitals may never have had a birth certificate and may be unable to obtain one, as seen in the case of Ms. Lewis. Young people and many low-income people often do not have a copy of their birth certificates at home. Birth certificates can usually be obtained from vital records offices in the state of the voter’s birth, but a fee typically applies. In addition, given America’s highly mobile work force, many individuals do not live in the city or state in which they were born, and most vital records offices require individuals to appear in person or to already have another form of government-issued identification to order a birth certificate online or by telephone. Even those who do have a birth certificate may not be able to use it to establish their citizenship. For example, many married women do not have a birth certificate that reflects their current name.  
Likewise, both Kansas and Arizona will accept a U.S. Passport, but only about 39% of U.S. citizens nationwide have a passport. Worse, this percentage is much lower among those who lack other forms of proof of citizenship. 
 
States that require documentary proof-of-citizenship vary in what kinds of documents they will accept. Unfortunately, although the laws on first read appear to permit a wide variety of documents to be accepted, the reality is that many of the acceptable documents either don’t exist or are not obtainable for many individuals.  Both Kansas and Arizona, for example, claim to accept a driver’s license or identification card issued by another state if the document indicates on its face whether the applicant is a citizen.  Since no state—including Kansas and Arizona themselves2—issues licenses or identification cards containing such a citizenship indicator, these states effectively permit only their own licenses to be used.  
Similar problems limit voters’ ability to use the other acceptable documents.  For example, certificates of naturalization issued prior to 1975 cannot be used to register by mail in Arizona or Kansas. To register by mail in those states, a naturalized citizen must list her naturalization number on the voter registration application. The naturalization number on certificates issued prior to 1975, however, cannot be used to verify citizenship. As a result, citizens who naturalized prior to 1975 must present the original naturalization certificate to elections officials in person in order to register.  Having to make a trip to a county elections office during business hours—when most people have to be at their jobs—rather than simply mailing in a voter registration application makes the process of registering to vote much more difficult and time-consuming for these individuals and may deter many voters from ever registering. 
 
In addition to making it more difficult for individual citizens to register to vote, documentary proof-of-citizenship laws make voter registration drives by community groups and other organizations virtually impossible.  It is easy enough to see why:  States like Kansas and Arizona require potential registrants to produce documents that many people to not possess at all or do not carry with them as they conduct their day-to-day affairs—precisely when registration drives seek to reach them.
Since the passage of the NVRA, community-based voter registration drives have added millions of voters to the nation’s voting rolls.  Such drives have been particularly important for increasing registration among communities of color.  Black and Latino voters are much more likely than white voters to register through privately conducted voter registration drives.  Community-based voter registration drives aim to eliminate the most common barriers to registration by going to potential voters and facilitating the registration process—including by explaining the requirements and providing assistance filling out forms. 
Many of these voter registration drives take place at public locations, such as churches, senior centers, college campuses, and other high-traffic areas.  Even when individuals possess one of the required forms of documentation, aside from driver’s licenses they do not routinely keep them on their persons and may not have them when they encounter a voter registration drive at one of these locations.  Few people carry a birth certificate, passport, naturalization documents, or tribal documentation.  In fact, some people keep their birth certificates or passports in safe deposit boxes, requiring a trip to the bank during regular business hours to access them.  Likewise, students who move for school may leave important paperwork at their parents’ homes and be unable to register until they retrieve it.  
Even if the voter does have an acceptable form of proof of citizenship, she may be unwilling to provide even a copy of her driver’s license, birth certificate, or passport to a stranger, given very legitimate concerns that it will be lost or stolen or that identity theft will occur.
No.  Requiring documentary evidence of citizenship has little impact on the incidence of voter registration fraud, firstly because such fraud by non-citizens is extremely rare in the first place if it even occurs at all, and secondly because states can—and already do—avail themselves of other mechanisms to ensure that non-citizens do not intentionally or inadvertently register.  On the other hand, the harmful impact of documentary proof-of-citizenship laws on the ability of eligible citizens to register to vote is dramatic. 
In support of their request to the EAC to alter the federal form, Arizona and Kansas both submitted what they claimed was evidence of voter registration by non-citizens but none of this evidence actually demonstrated that a non-citizen had voted.  For example, Kansas submitted evidence that, based on a cross-reference of its voter registration list to its driver’s license database, a total of 21 individuals had who held a type of driver’s license issued to non-citizens had registered to vote between 2009 and 2010. The state did not investigate whether these individuals had become citizens prior to registering to vote, however, but it later admitted that at least one of them was in fact a naturalized citizen.  In addition, only four of the 20 possible non-citizens ever actually voted.  
As Kansas’s own analysis shows, demanding documentary evidence of citizenship from voters is not necessary to ensure that non-citizens do not register.  Rather than placing the burden of demonstrating citizenship on voters, the very cross-referencing of driver and voter data the state conducted in support of its request to change the federal form could be used to enforce its citizenship requirement in the first place.  In addition to driver’s license data, other interstate and federal databases can be used to verify citizenship without asking voters for documentation they may not have.  Additionally, the threat of deportation or criminal prosecution has a powerful deterrent effect on non-citizens who have little to gain by falsely registering to vote.
In sharp contrast, during the same period in which 20 alleged non-citizens registered to vote, Kansas received voter registration applications from approximately 20,000 individuals that were not accompanied by documentary evidence of citizenship.  As a result, these individuals’ registrations were held in suspense—leaving them ineligible to vote—while the state requested the required evidence.  At the time of this writing, over 18,000 voter registrations remain in suspense in Kansas, the vast majority of them almost certainly submitted by eligible citizens who will be unable to vote in November.
 
Yes and no.  In 2013, the Supreme Court decided the case of Inter-Tribal Council of Arizona, et al. vs. Arizona, in which advocacy groups and individuals affected by Arizona’s documentary proof-of-citizenship law challenged Arizona’s refusal to register voters using the federal form unless it was accompanied by documentary evidence of citizenship.  The Court held that Arizona must accept the federal form whether accompanied by documentary evidence of citizenship or not, and then went on to say that the state could ask the EAC to alter the form to require documentary proof of citizenship.  The current Kobach case argued in the Tenth Circuit on August 25 arose after Arizona, along with Kansas and Georgia, made such a request and the EAC rejected it.
In the meantime, Arizona, Kansas, and the other states that require documentary evidence of citizenship have accepted the federal form and registered voters who use it.  Kansas, however, currently allows voters using the federal form to vote only for candidates for federal offices, such as President or Senator, unless the form is accompanied by evidence of citizenship the state deems satisfactory. 
 
State laws requiring voters to submit documentary evidence of citizenship in order to register to vote are already having a dramatic and harmful effect on citizens’ ability to participate in the political process in the states that have them. Conversely, they do almost nothing to reduce voter registration fraud, a problem that barely exists in the first place.  ",research
"The first presidential election since Citizens United lived up to its hype, with unprecedented outside spending from new sources making headlines.
Demos and U.S. PIRG Education Fund analysis of reports from campaigns, parties, and outside spenders to the Federal Election Commission found that our big money system distorts democracy and creates clear winners and losers.
Newly minted Super PACs dominated outside spending reported to the FEC, aggregating huge sums from millionaires and billionaires.
Fundraising for candidate campaigns was also dominated by an elite donor class and special interests.
Super PACs raised a significant portion of their funds from business interests.
Candidates, and especially winning candidates, raised a significant portion of their funds from political action committees (PACs).
Non-profit groups, which before 2010 were not allowed to directly spend on elections, spent big while hiding the identity of their donors.
The first presidential campaign cycle since the Supreme Court’s Citizens United ruling lived up to its hype, breaking previous records for total spending and exaggerating the undue electoral power of wealthy individuals and special interests to the point of awakening unprecedented public focus on the failings of our campaign finance system.
This report offers a comprehensive analysis of the fundraising and spending in federal races in the 2012 elections. The primary goal is to provide a quantitative analysis to describe tangibly what the vast majority of Americans already understand: political power in America is concentrated in the hands of an elite fraction of the populace—threatening the very concept of government of, by, and for the people.
While thankfully the amount of money raised and spent is not a perfect predictor of victory in our elections, it is undeniably a key to every step of the process of running for office—from deciding whether to put one’s hat into the ring to qualifying for the ballot to securing a major party nomination and amplifying a message during a general election campaign. The rising cost of elections makes it increasingly difficult to raise the threshold amount of money necessary to compete at each stage of a campaign. Thus as the cost of elections soars our candidate pool shrinks, cutting off opportunities to serve for average Americans and narrowing the spectrum of views and perspectives offered to the public at the polls.
But, more important than the total amount spent in any election is where all this money comes from. If candidates for federal office were mostly raising money in small contributions from average citizens, and if outside spending groups were organizing these average citizens to give them a louder voice in the political process, the sheer volume of money raised and spent might not present such a troubling problem.
Unfortunately, if unsurprisingly, this is not the case. Spending on modern U.S. elections is dominated by a small minority of special interests and wealthy donors who use their economic clout to amplify their preferred messages and drown out the voices of ordinary citizens in the public square.
The wealthy translate their greater electoral role into increased influence over public policy in two basic ways: by helping elect candidates who share their values, and by limiting the range of acceptable policy positions that candidates may take if they want to remain competitive—effectively shaping the agenda in Washington and state capitals across the country.
This outsized role of wealthy individuals and special interests in U.S. elections is inherently unfair. One can view American history as a long and arduous struggle to fulfill the promise of true political equality. From the Declaration of Independence through the Reconstruction Amendments and the Supreme Court’s one-person, one-vote, poll tax, property requirement, and candidate filing fee cases, we’ve struggled to push past restrictions on participation based upon race, gender, and wealth. The continued disproportionate influence of the wealthy violates the basic principle of political equality and shows we have not yet completed our journey.
But the problems with big money dominance go beyond the theoretical. 
New research shows that because the wealthy hold different policy priorities than does the general public, their dominance of elections actually skews public policy. Those who aspire to win or keep public office are caught in a never-ending arms race, forced to spend precious time dialing for dollars, raising more and more money to keep up with both opposing candidates and a potential onslaught of outside spending fueled by any special interest they may have offended by word or deed. And, our analysis shows that incumbents fare quite well in the current big-money system. Meanwhile, non-wealthy Americans, grassroots candidates, and public faith in democracy fare significantly less well.
These problems came into stark relief during the Republican presidential primaries, when huge gifts to Super PACs shifted the dynamics of the entire campaign and Stephen Colbert provided a satirical lesson in modern civics to an outraged cadre of late-night viewers.2 But, we didn’t get here overnight. Our current problems stem from a lack of Congressional initiative combined with more than 40 years of misguided jurisprudence, which has tied the hands of citizens, advocates, and elected officials.
It doesn’t have to be this way. A campaign finance system that empowers average citizens—by providing incentives for small contributions and strictly limiting both contributions to candidates and outside spending, for example—can promote political equality, enable candidates and elected officials to spend more time reaching out to a broad range of constituents, and better align policy outcomes with public preferences. We conclude our analysis by offering concrete policy recommendations to help create a “small donor democracy.” 
These solutions won’t be easy to enact. But, the good news is that the American public is squarely on the side of reform.3 And, thanks to the conspicuously undemocratic role of money in the 2012 elections there is more attention to the problems with our democracy, and energy behind fixing them, now than perhaps at any time since the aftermath of Watergate in the mid-seventies.
Now is the time to finally build a democracy in which the size if a citizen’s wallet does not determine the strength of her voice.

"Although each major party presidential candidate will likely break previous fundraising records, the big story of the 2012 election has been the role of Super PACs, nonprofits and outside spending generally.
Demos and U.S. PIRG Education Fund analysis of Federal Election Commission (FEC) data and secondary sources on outside spending and Super PAC fundraising for the first two quarters of the 2012 election cycle reveals:
Outside spending by organizations that aggregate unlimited contributions from wealthy individuals and institutions is playing a significant role in the 2012 election cycle, and much of it is not disclosed.
Super PACs continue to be tools used by a small number of wealthy individuals and institutions to dominate the political process.
 
The Republican presidential primaries introduced the world to Super PACs—political committees empowered to raise unlimited funds from virtually any source and spend this money to influence U.S. elections.  These “independent expenditure committees” were actually created back in 2010 as a result of a D.C. Circuit Court decision in the wake of Citizens United.1  They spent $65 million in the 2010 cycle.2  Yet few outside of Washington had heard of them before Sheldon Adelson gave $10 million to one and Stephen Colbert started his own.
Super PACs have fast become a favored tool for wealthy individuals and interests to drown out the voices of average citizens.  At the end of the 2010 election cycle, there were 84 active super PACs.3 As of June 30, 2012 there were 220 active Super PACs, which have raised more than $312 million for the 2012 election. There’s even a Super PAC dedicated to ending Super PACs, proving the entity has truly arrived.4
In February, we reported on the funding sources of Super PACs through 2011.  With data now in for the first two quarters of 2012, fundraising trends for Super PACs continue to raise serious concerns for our democracy.  The vast majority of Super PACs’ funds continues to come from a tiny minority of wealthy individuals giving tens of thousands, or even millions, of dollars.  For-profit businesses continue to provide a significant portion of Super PAC funding.  And, a small percentage of the money raised by Super PACs cannot be traced back to its original source.
But, Super PACs don’t have a monopoly on distorting our democracy.  For all their problems, Super PACs have one significant virtue: transparency.  They are required to report all of their spending on a real-time basis and all of their donors monthly or quarterly to the Federal Election Commission.  As we move further into an election cycle that will almost certainly shatter all previous records for fundraising and spending,5 other, less transparent, forms of outside spending are coming increasingly to the fore. 
Nonprofit “social welfare” organizations exempt from taxes under Section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code and trade or membership associations organized under Section 501(c)(6) are permitted to spend money to influence federal, state, and local elections, but are not required to disclose the identities of their donors or the amounts of their contributions.6
These “dark money” groups actually outspent Super PACs in the 2010 cycle by a substantial margin,7 and they are poised to have a significant effect on this year’s elections as well.  But, we don’t have the full picture of secret spending in 2012 for two reasons. 
First, if historical trends continue, secret spending will spike in the months immediately preceding the election.  The data is not in for these critical final months, but in the following pages we report on trends from past years, which shed some light on what’s to come.  Second, because of reporting gaps discussed in detail below, much of this spending is doubly-secret—not only do we not know the source of the donors, but the spending itself is not reported to the FEC or any other public agency. 
Despite this incomplete picture, there is mounting evidence that nonprofits will again outspend Super PACs in 2012.  In the pages that follow, we examine a cross-section of this evidence.
This report focuses on spending by outside, non-candidate groups attempting to influence federal elections.  But, this is not because outside spending is inherently bad.  There is nothing wrong with organized groups of Americans voicing their views about candidates and their positions on critical issues in the context of an election, as long as the strength of their voices has some relationship to the number of persons who support the views being expressed.   
The reason that outside spending is currently distorting our democracy is that this unlimited spending is derived in large part from unlimited contributions.  The vast majority of 2012 outside spending is being conducted not by grassroots organizations that are aggregating the power and voices of thousands or millions of people making small political contributions, but rather by a small number of organizations that aggregate the power and voices of a tiny minority of wealthy individuals, businesses, or interest groups contributing sums that are well beyond the reach of average-earning citizens.
One might think of today’s outside spending groups as megaphones for moguls and millionaires. The more money they pump in, the louder they’re able to amplify their voices—until a relatively few wealthy individuals and interests are dominating our public square, drowning out the rest of us.
This type of distortion is worse when much of the spending is secret, insulating big spenders from accountability and denying voters both critical information to make informed choices and a holistic picture of just how distorted the system is.
Candidate fundraising is distorted too—candidates have long raised the majority of their funds from a small minority giving $1000+ contributions.8  But candidate funding is limited and disclosed, and so in today’s campaigns, outside spending is where the distortion is most extreme.
This distortion violates our shared commitment to political equality and the principle of one-person, one-vote.  It shapes a political system in which the size of a citizen’s wallet determines the strength of her voice. 
What can be done to correct this distortion and create a democracy that is truly of, by, and for the people?  The Supreme Court has caused much of the problem by turning the First Amendment into a tool for wealthy individuals and institutions to use to dominate political campaigns.  This means that we ultimately need to take back the First Amendment—either by appointing justices who will interpret it properly, or by explicitly amending the Constitution.  In the meantime, there is plenty that our democratically elected leaders can do to repair our distorted democracy.  We provide specific policy recommendations after our analysis.
 
The following analysis details all of the money spent independently of candidates to influence federal elections that is reported to the FEC.  As we note below, because of gaps in reporting requirements this does not provide the full picture of outside spending, or of outside spending funded through secret sources.

The top five outside spending organizations were responsible for 58.5 percent of reported outside spending thus far in the 2012 cycle.
Of the spending reported to the FEC, $12.7 million, or 7.6 percent was secret spending, not traceable to an original source.9




 
We define “outside spending” here as spending intended to influence a federal election that is not conducted by or coordinated with a candidate for federal office.10 The three components of such spending are “independent expenditures,” “electioneering communications,” and “issue advocacy” that is in fact intended to influence elections.  Unfortunately, current reporting standards are insufficient to describe the full picture. 
An “independent expenditure” is defined by the FEC as an expenditure for a communication ""expressly advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate that is not made in cooperation, consultation, or concert with, or at the request or suggestion of, a candidate, a candidate’s authorized committee, or their agents, or a political party or its agents.""11  An “electioneering communication” is any broadcast, cable or satellite communication that refers to a clearly identified federal candidate; is publicly distributed by a television station, radio station, cable television system or satellite system for a fee; and is distributed within 60 days prior to a general election or 30 days prior to a primary election for federal office.12 Any entity that conducts either of these two types of spending must report the amount of the spending and the candidate(s) supported or opposed to the FEC with 24 or 48 hours.13
Some groups, however, attempt to influence elections through “issue advocacy.”  Some of these communications are as they sound—legitimate efforts to influence elected officials to support or oppose legislation or other pending matters.  But, other “issue advocacy” communications are actually thinly veiled efforts to convince voters to support or oppose a particular candidate.  An ad that looks exactly the same as an electioneering communication is considered “issue advocacy” if it falls outside of the windows of time described above.  This type of sham issue advocacy is not tracked by the FEC or any public agency.14  While there are some private organizations that track these issue ads, there is no free central public database. 
A recent Federal Communications Commission rule will require broadcasters to make this information available online.15  But, the information will not be in a searchable format.  And, the requirement will initially only apply to affiliates of the four major networks in the top 50 media markets; remaining stations have until July 2014 to comply.16  Media tracking firm Kantar CMAG estimates that the rule will cover 60 percent of the political ads in the 2012 cycle.17
This reporting gap prevents us from giving a complete picture of all the outside spending by those attempting to influence the election. But, we do know that many groups that spend on such communications are 501(c)(4) nonprofits that do not have to disclose their donors. According to data from Kantar CMAG, the top four 501(c)(4) spenders on the presidential race have spent $43.3 million on advertising in the presidential race alone18 through July 1st, but our analysis shows that these same groups have only reported spending $418,920 collectively on all races to the FEC through June 30th. This means that these groups are currently reporting less than 1% of their total spending.
Thus the numbers reported in the above section, which do not include issue advocacy, are a vast underestimate of the true amount of secret money in this year’s election cycle and there is good reason to believe that outside spending by secret sources will eclipse that of transparent sources when the FEC begins to track many of these expenditures as electioneering communications when the general election window opens on September 7th.
 
There are a few ways to estimate the actual proportion of secret money in the current election cycle.  First, we can look at past practice.  A study by the Center for Public Integrity and Center for Responsive Politics found that, in 2010, 501(c) groups outspent all Super PACs for the entire cycle by a ratio of three-to-two—only counting independent expenditures and electioneering communications reported to the FEC, not counting any issue advocacy.19
One might think that this cycle will look quite different thanks to the unprecedented size of the candidate-specific presidential Super PACs.  But, the limited available data suggests otherwise.  Kantar CMAG data posted online by the Washington Post allows us a decent view of issue ad spending on the presidential campaign and gives us some evidence about the size of the gap between what’s reported to the FEC and what’s actually being spent.

Data on ad buys can tell us quite a bit about dark money in federal races beyond just the presidential campaign as well.  A Washington Post analysis of Kantar CMAG data found that 91% of the spending on campaign ads through April 22, 2012 was by nonprofit organizations that do not disclose their donors.20
Furthermore, although these nonprofits are not required to report their issue ad spending, some have publicly declared their intention to spend huge sums.  Lee Drutman of Sunlight Foundation produced a very helpful tally showing that just a few top dark money groups have already spent more than the 2010 total for all dark money groups, and have plans to spend up to $900 million through the 2012 cycle.21 If these top spenders fulfill their objectives they will spend almost triple the $312 million Super PACs have raised so far this cycle.22
 
 
Our analysis of FEC data through June 30, 2012 shows that Super PACs continue to raise the majority of their funds from wealthy individuals, a significant amount of money from for-profit businesses, and a small amount of “secret” funds that cannot be traced back to an original source.

A small number of wealthy individuals have been dominating the financing of political campaigns since long before the courts created “independent expenditure-only committees.”23  But Super PACs have made a bad situation worse, and our analysis of 2012 cycle FEC data reveals the disproportionate influence of the wealthiest donors.
Individuals are responsible for the majority of Super PAC funds: 73.8 percent.  The average itemized contribution from an individual to a Super PAC in the 2012 election cycle was $19,944.24
Of all money Super PACs raised from individuals in the 2012 cycle, 94.1 percent came in contributions of at least $10,000—from just 1082 individuals, or 0.00035 percent of the American population.  More than half (57.1 percent) of individual Super PAC money came from just 47 people giving at least $1 million.  These same 47 people were responsible for 42.1% of all the money Super PACs raised for the cycle (counting contributions from both individuals and organizations).

Allowing for-profit businesses to spend treasury funds to influence elections allows those who have generated wealth by making widgets or selling cell phones to translate this economic success directly into amplification of their political voice, and therefore power.  This runs contrary to basic principles of political equality.
Yet, 515 for-profit businesses have contributed $34.2 million to Super PACs in the 2012 cycle, accounting for 11.0% of total Super PAC fundraising.

The percentage of Super PAC funds coming from for-profit businesses is down for the 2012 cycle compared with all Super PAC fundraising through the end of 2011 (when it was 17 percent).  This is due in part to increased individual contributions to Super PACs and in part to businesses giving relatively less to Super PACs in the past six months. 
The reduced level of business contributions is likely because Super PACs must report their donors and for-profit businesses have other avenues for political participation that do not risk negative exposure.   A few accidental disclosures in recent months—for example, Aetna’s inadvertent reporting of $7 million dollars given to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and a 501(c)(4) corporation for—have given credence to the suspicion that secret contributions are the new favorite avenue for businesses to influence elections.25
 
 
As noted above, most secret spending in this election has not flowed through Super PACs.  While there was considerable initial concern that Super PACs were setting up non-profit arms in order to funnel money to themselves while hiding the identity of their donors, it turns out that non-profits have tended to spend money directly rather than sending it first to a Super PAC.  Nonetheless, a small percentage of Super PAC funds cannot be feasibly traced to its original source.
Our analysis of FEC data shows that 2.8% of the funds raised by Super PACs in the 2012 cycle was “secret money.”
Seventeen percent of active Super PACs26 received money from untraceable sources.  Four out of the 10 Super PACs that raised the most money in the 2012 cycle received money from untraceable sources. 

 
Justice Louis D. Brandeis famously said, ""We must make our choice. We may have democracy, or we may have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can't have both.""27 He might have also said, “We can have democracy write the rules for capitalism, or we can let private wealth control public power—we have to choose.”
We live in a representative democracy with a capitalist economy.  This means that we hold different values dear in the economic and political spheres. 
Most Americans will tolerate some economic inequality, so long as it results from meritocratic competition, because we respect that other values such as efficiency and proper incentives have a role to play in structuring our economy.  One’s political ideology to a certain extent determines how much inequality one is willing to sanction in the name of other values—with, all else being equal, self-identified conservatives comfortable with a wider income gap than self-identified liberals or progressives. 
Political equality, on the other hand, is a core American value.  Regardless of partisan or ideological affiliation, the vast majority of Americans agree that it is critical that we all come to the political table as equals.  Through multiple amendments and Supreme Court decisions, the concept of political equality (“one person, one vote”) has become a core constitutional principle.
But, we cannot maintain a democracy of equal citizens in the face of significant economic inequality if we allow those who are successful (or lucky) in the economic sphere to translate wealth directly into political power.  Our democratic public sphere is where we set the terms for economic competition.  It is where we decide—as equals—how much inequality, redistribution, regulation, pollution we will tolerate.  These choices gain legitimacy from the fact that we all had the opportunity to have our say.  If economic incumbents are able to rig the rules in favor of their own success it undermines the legitimacy of the economic relations in society.
In short, democracy must write the rules for capitalism, not the other way around. And, the only way to ensure this happens is to have some mechanism for preventing wealthy individuals and institutions from translating their wealth into political power.  Campaign finance rules are that mechanism.  These common sense restrictions on the unfettered use of private wealth for public influence are the bulwarks or firewalls that enable us to maintain our democratic values and a capitalist economy simultaneously.   When we remove these protections, we risk creating a society in which private wealth and public power are one and the same.
Non-candidate spending in federal elections is not inherently bad.  But, in our current system, outside spending amplifies the voices of the wealthy and allows a tiny minority of wealthy individuals and interests to drown out the voices of the vast majority of average-earning citizens.
As noted above, many outside spending organizations do not report the source or amount of their contributions.  But, what we do know demonstrates that a huge percentage of the money raised and spent by these groups is coming from a tiny number of wealthy individuals and institutions.
 
One example reported recently by Mother Jones magazine illustrates the problem clearly.28  Sheldon Adelson, the billionaire casino magnate, and his wife Miriam have given a combined $36.3 million to Super PACs this election cycle.29  That’s a lot of money—but not to them.  The Adelson family has an estimated net worth of $24.9 billion, which means that $36.3 million is just 0.15% of their total wealth.  That’s the equivalent of the average middle class family (with a net worth of $77,300) spending $113 on this election.  Mr. Adelson has said he’s willing to spend up to $100 million to support conservative causes and candidates this cycle30—the equivalent of $310 to a motivated middle class family.
""What the Supreme Court did in Citizens United is to say to these same billionaires and the corporations they control: 'You own and control the economy; you own Wall Street; you own the coal companies; you own the oil companies. Now, for a very small percentage of your wealth, we're going to give you the opportunity to own the United States government.' '' – U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders
One could view Mr. and Mrs. Adelson as just like tens of thousands of other American couples who hold clear political views and want to do their part to make a difference—so they write a few checks that add up to a relatively trivial percentage of their net worth.  The average family might cut a $75 check to the NRA or Sierra Club, and then make a $40 online gift to a presidential candidate and contribute $25 at a local congressional fundraiser.  They have their voices heard, but have a small chance of making a marginal difference in any given race—similar to voting.
For the Adelson family, that same “small” set of gifts ads up to $36.3 million which can fundamentally alter the course of a presidential race.  The Adelsons may not care more about politics than the average family—after all, if they did why not dig a little deeper?—but they certainly have more influence. 
It would take more than 321,000 American families making the same sacrifice as the Adelsons to equal their political giving.  Every single 2008 voter in the United States would have to contribute 27 cents to equal the Adelson family’s giving.32
The problem is not restricted to wealthy conservatives.  Noted film producer (and liberal) Jeffrey Katzenberg has contributed $2.1 million to Super PACs this cycle.  Forbes estimated his net worth at $1 billion in 2005.33  This would make his contributions this cycle just 0.21% of his total wealth—but enough to pay for a lot of airtime to support his favorite candidates.
The fact that a tiny number of very wealthy Americans have such a louder voice in our democracy is inherently unfair.  But, it would not necessarily skew political outcomes and have real-world consequences if the extremely rich and the merely rich had the same policy preferences and priorities as average-earning citizens.
A growing body of academic research, however, has demonstrated what common sense tells most of us already: very wealthy people don’t work, live, or think like the rest of us.34  This means that when their wealth gives their views and priorities greater weight, our elected officials focus differently and actual policy outcomes are affected.
Sheldon Adelson is one example.  His most prominent policy position may not be slanted by his vast wealth, but this wealth puts extra (undemocratic) heft behind that view.  The Atlantic has reported that Mr. Adelson opposes a two-state solution in the Middle East and has feuded with AIPAC, the pro-Israel lobby in Washington, for conducting activities he saw as “unduly pro-Palestinian.”35 Contrast this with a June 2011 Pew poll in which only 21% of Americans said President Obama was favoring Palestinians too much.36
But, his other major political priority seems to be directly tied to his wallet. The New York Times recently noted that
""[Mr. Adelson] rails against the president’s ‘socialist-style economy’ and redistribution of wealth, but what he really fears is Mr. Obama’s proposal to raise taxes on companies like his that make a huge amount of money overseas. Ninety percent of the earnings of his company, the Las Vegas Sands Corporation, come from hotel and casino properties in Singapore and Macau….Because of the lower tax rate in those countries (currently zero in Macau), the company now has a United States corporate tax rate of 9.8 percent, compared with the statutory rate of 35 percent. President Obama has repeatedly proposed ending the deductions and credits that allow corporations like Las Vegas Sands to shelter billions in income overseas, but has been blocked by Republicans.""37
Contrast this view with the 90% of small business owners (a plurality of whom identified as Republican or leaning Republican) who believe that big corporations use loopholes to avoid paying taxes that small businesses pay, according to a February 2012 poll by the American Sustainable Business Council.38
 
 
Contrary to the Citizens United ruling, for-profit businesses should not be permitted to spend money to influence elections.  There is no more direct violation of the principle of democracy writing the rules for capitalism than to allow for-profit businesses to craft those rules by influencing who writes them.
Business spending on elections also presents challenges for shareholders who may see their money spent by managers on candidates that they do not support in a way that may bear only a tangential, or even negative, relationship to the business bottom line.  In fact recent studies have shown that corporate political spending has either no effect or a negative effect on profits.39
 
 
Unlike limits on campaign contributions and spending, support for transparency in campaigns has traditionally been strong across the political spectrum,40 and the Supreme Court extolled its benefits in the very decision that laid the groundwork for Super PACs.41  Big spending by individuals and for-profit businesses distorts our democracy by giving some a greater voice.  Secret spending presents three different types of harm.
First, and most obviously, secret spending denies voters the opportunity to “follow the money” and understand the motives behind the messages that are flooding the airwaves during election season.  One might be more skeptical of an ad praising a candidate’s environmental record if one knows it is sponsored by an oil company.  Senator Mitch McConnell, a leading opponent of campaign finance restrictions referred to this value when he said in 1997 that “[p]ublic disclosure of campaign contributions and spending should be expedited so voters can judge for themselves what is appropriate.""42
The second problem with secret spending is that it denies citizens the opportunity to hold political actors accountable for their actions in the public sphere.  This reduces the incentive for groups to provide accurate information to the public, and tends to coarsen our public discourse generally.  A recent Annenberg Public Policy Center study found that, “from December 1, 2011 through June 1, 2012, 85% of the dollars spent on presidential ads by four top-spending third-party groups known as 501(c)(4)s were spent on ads containing at least one claim ruled deceptive by fact-checkers at FactCheck.org, PolitiFact.com, the Fact Checker at the Washington Post or the Associated Press.”43
It also makes other forms of accountability difficult or impossible.  Consumers, for example, might not want the money they spend on hamburgers or plastic deck chairs funneled into causes or candidates they oppose.  Target Corporation experienced this type of healthy accountability when its customer base reacted strongly to revelations that it contributed to an organization supporting a gubernatorial candidate who opposes equal marriage rights for same-sex couples.44
Support for this concept of public accountability comes from notably conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who wrote “[r]equiring people to stand up in public for their political acts fosters civic courage, without which democracy is doomed. For my part, I do not look forward to a society which campaigns anonymously…and even exercises the direct democracy of initiative and referendum hidden from public scrutiny and protected from the accountability of criticism. This does not resemble the Home of the Brave.”45
The third problem with the lack of transparency in our system is that without the full picture of election spending it is more difficult to build the case for reform.  As any doctor knows, the first step to heal a system is to properly diagnose the problem.  This is more difficult to do without a complete picture.  As Demos C. Edwin Baker Fellow Rakim H.D. Brooks has written:
""Having complete knowledge about who is bankrolling political ads would permit the American people to finally have an empirical conversation about corporate influence in, and elite domination of, our political debates. Imagine if, tomorrow, the New York Times revealed that 90 percent of all political ads were sponsored by the same 100 people. It might not change our reflections on the substance of the ads. Again, I believe we can ascertain…fact from fiction well enough now. But we might ask the more fundamental question of whether it is fair for so few to speak so frequently.""46
Right now, even by diligently searching FEC filings, a citizen cannot know exactly how few people or institutions are responsible for how many decibels in the public debate over the 2012 elections.
 
Outside spending is not inherently bad.  But, our research shows that outside spending groups that aggregate unlimited contributions are distorting our democracy, functioning as megaphones for (sometimes unseen) millionaires and moguls.
We know that the vast majority of the funds raised by transparent organizations such as Super PACs is coming from a small number of wealthy individuals and for-profit businesses.  Other groups are spending millions to influence our votes without reporting their donors.  And, millions of dollars of this “dark money” is doubly-secret—not only are the donors undisclosed, but the spending itself is not reported to the public in any systemic way.
This undermines political equality and accountability, and denies voters the opportunity to properly evaluate messages targeted at them, and the ability to see the full scope of distortion.  In the following section we provide recommendations for mitigating the undemocratic influence of these organizations.

"Connecticut has offered a voluntary public financing system for state-wide constitutional and General Assembly offices since 2008. Through financing from the Citizens' Election Fund, candidates that obtain the required number of small donations can receive a lump sum to fund their campaign. The program is very popular and in 2012, 77 percent of successful candidates were publicly financed. 
This report looks at the impact public financing has had on campaigning, the legislative process, policy outcomes, and the dynamics of the legislature. Empirical data is supplemented with interviews with current and former legislators from both Republican and Democratic parties, elected state officials, and advocates to highlight the impact of public financing in the state. While only a few electoral cycles in, it is clear that public financing is a fundamental step towards a more representative legislative process that is more responsive to constituents.
 
As one legislator recounted, “I announced my reelection bid in February and by April, I was done fundraising. So, from April to November, I could focus only on talking to constituents. Without public financing, I would have been fundraising through that entire period.”
In contrast to fundraising from just a few big donors, publicly financed candidates must receive donations from a minimum number of in-district donors (150 for State House and 300 for State Senate) resulting in a larger donor pool.
A former legislator recalls, “Before public financing, during the session…there were “shakedowns” where lobbyists and corporate sponsors had events and you as a legislator had to go. That’s no longer a part of the reality.”
In 2008, there were the fewest number of uncontested seats since 1998, indicating that more candidates are running.
Public financing is resulting in a legislature that is more representative of the state’s demographics. For example, the Latino representation in the state legislature reached its greatest level in 2012 and women make up 32 percent of the current legislature.
As a current Republican legislator states, “Now, people concentrate more on the issues, read the issues. You see more votes that are bipartisan and the big issues get bipartisan votes.”
With public financing and the alignment of the governor with the legislature, Connecticut passed mandatory paid sick days, increased the minimum wage, adopted an Earned Income Tax Credit, passed in-state tuition for undocumented students, and reversed a nearly 30-year trend that gave bottle deposits back to distributors and redirected the money to public programs.
Connecticut’s experience shows that public financing is a fundamental part of a stronger democracy that is more responsive to constituents, rather than big donor and special interests.

"American democracy is based upon the fundamental principle of one person, one vote—the simple notion that we are all equal before the law and should have an equal say over the government decisions that affect our lives. But unfortunately our system often more closely resembles one dollar, one vote as wealthy donors enjoy vastly disproportionate influence over who runs for office, who wins elections, and what issues make it onto the agenda in Washington, DC. This threatens the integrity and legitimacy of our democracy, as ordinary citizens come to the justified conclusion that the system is rigged and their voices are being drowned out in a sea of campaign cash.
We must reduce the undue influence of wealthy donors by amplifying the voices of all Americans. The Government By the People Act increases the power of the small contributions that ordinary citizens can afford to give, providing incentives for congressional candidates to reach out to average constituents, not just dial for dollars from wealthy donors. It’s the single best policy we can immediately enact to democratize the influence of money in politics. Though the Supreme Court, in a long line of cases from Buckley v. Valeo to Citizens United v. FEC, has tied the People’s hands, blocking us from enforcing common-sense limits on the use of big money in politics, we remain free to tackle the problem from the other side of the equation—providing incentives to bring more small donors into the system.
We need a government of, by, and for the people, not bought and paid for by wealthy donors. This proposal puts the U.S. Congress back in the hands of ordinary Americans.
Time and again, our government fails to produce the policy outcomes that the majority of Americans support— from strong investments in jobs, roads, and rails to a robust minimum wage and a fair tax burden for the one percent. Recent political science research points to a key reason why, empirically documenting the disproportionate influence of wealthy donors in our political process.1
The wealthy have sharply different policy preferences and priorities than does the general public—especially on basic issues of how to structure the economy.2 While differences in opinion are the lifeblood of democracy, the policy preferences of the wealthy are much more likely to translate into actual policy outcomes in the U.S. When the preferences of the top 10 percent of the income ladder diverge from the rest of the public, the 10 percent trumps the 90 percent nearly every time.3 This lead the author of the leading study on the topic to conclude that “under most circumstances the preferences of the vast majority of Americans appear to have essentially no impact on which policies the government does or doesn’t adopt.”4

The central reason for this dramatic gap in whose policy preferences receive attention is our big money campaign finance system.5 Since the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United ruling, there has been a lot of discussion about the dramatic rise in outside spending driven by unlimited contributions by wealthy donors. In 2012, nearly 90 percent of Super PAC funding from individuals came in contributions of at least $50,000 and almost 60 percent came in $1,000,000 or more.6​​​​​​​
But, many don’t realize that candidate fundraising is also dramatically skewed towards the wealthy. For example, 2012 candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives got the majority of the funds they raised from individuals (55 percent) in contributions of at least $1,000—from just 0.06 percent of the U.S. population.7​​​​​​​ The equivalent figure for Senate candidates was 64 percent of funds from just 0.04 percent.8

In some ways, the dominance of candidate fundraising by a small minority of wealthy donors is more significant than even the billions of dollars of outside spending. Candidate fundraising dynamics affect who runs for office, the views of those who do, and ultimately who wins elections.
Because candidates need to raise a threshold amount of money to run viable campaigns, those who can afford to give $1,000 or $2,000 to campaigns—the donor class9—act as de facto gatekeepers, filtering the pool of “acceptable” candidates long before voters have their say at the polls.
The need to secure large donations from a very small percentage of the population in turn influences how candidates spend their time, and with whom. Miles Rapoport, current Demos president and former Connecticut state legislator and Secretary of State describes his experience running for Congress in 1998:
Every night I would lock myself in a room with a bag of chips and some strong coffee and make my calls, homing in on people who could ideally give me at least $500 or $1000 or more. And, when I was talking with these potential donors I found that their problems and concerns weren’t the same as the majority of folks I was looking to represent in Congress. I heard a lot about how excessive regulations were strangling their business or health care costs for their workers were a real burden. I was running as a progressive candidate and so my first instinct was to say, “now wait a minute, that’s not exactly right.” But, my goal on the phone was to get the contribution. So, by the end of the night, I found myself saying things like “well, that’s an interesting point you make and when I’m in Washington you should come by and we can talk more about that.” I wasn’t changing my positions, exactly, but there was definitely a shift in emphasis, and I could feel myself shifting as I spent more and more time talking to a very narrow set of wealthy donors. My sense of what was pressing and important may have been affected, and my sense of what types of positions I needed to be open to in order to win my race and get into Congress was certainly affected.10
In the end, of course, money plays a substantial role in determining who wins elections. In the 2012 elections 84 percent of House candidates who outspent their general election opponents won their elections, and winners raised on average more than twice as much as losers.11 While correlation should not be confused with causation and there are complicating factors, it seems fairly apparent that money matters.12 At the very least all of the major players in the elections game—candidates, donors, campaign consultants, etc.—act as if it matters; and this fact alone leads fundraising to drive decision-making.

The bottom line is that big money in politics warps Congress’ priorities and erodes public trust. Americans’ confidence in government is at an all-time low. Significant majorities express the concern that the actions of their government are responsive to the wishes of financial supporters; that their government does not represent their interests or respond to the needs of the broad populace anymore; and that this reflects a corruption of government and its ability to serve the public.13 For example, in May 2012, a prominent public polling firm reported that “[v]oters believe that Washington is so corrupted by big banks, big donors, and corporate lobbyists that it no longer works for the middle class.”14
In our distorted democracy, economic might is translated directly into political power and to a large extent the strength of a citizen’s voice depends upon the size of her wallet. This runs directly counter to core American values and threatens the very legitimacy of our democracy.
In February 2014, Congressman John Sarbanes, along with scores of colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives, introduced H.R. 20, the Government By the People Act. The goals of the legislation are to shift the balance of power away from wealthy interests and towards ordinary voters, and change the way candidates approach running for federal office so that they spend more time reaching out to regular voters and less time raising money from a small number of rich donors, thus deterring corruption and its appearance.
The Government By the People Act employs three basic strategies to accomplish its policy objectives in the current electoral environment: amplifying the voices of ordinary citizens by matching small contributions with public funds; empowering more Americans to participate in campaigns by providing a tax credit for small political contributions; and helping grassroots candidates fight back against special interest outside spending by providing an additional late-campaign match. These key elements combine with other features to create a voluntary system that most candidates for U.S. House should ultimately choose to use, because it frees them from the burdens and obligations of large-dollar fundraising and provides a more attractive way to run for office that is responsive to current campaign conditions.
It’s a voluntary system that will help grassroots candidates run on people power. Instead of raising most of their campaign cash from big donors in DC or New York, candidates will raise a large number of small contributions from people back home. Candidates qualify for the system by demonstrating local grassroots support—at least 1,000 in-state contributions adding up to at least $50,000. Then they agree to focus their campaigns on small donors and forgo contributions of more than $1,000. All of their contributions of $1 to $150 are matched on a six-to-one basis by a public fund (or an even higher match ratio under certain conditions). Contributors get a refundable tax credit of $25. Each candidate’s public funding is capped at a certain amount, and there would be strict enforcement of campaign finance laws, including disclosure of all donations.
Right now wealthy donors command more attention from candidates because big checks help win elections. That’s like having a bigger megaphone, or a direct line to power, which undermines people’s faith in our system. The Government By the People Act turns that dynamic on its head. First, the My Voice tax credit helps more people get into the game by making a small contribution. Next, the Freedom From Influence Fund will match small contributions 6-to-1 or more. That means that a $150 contribution becomes worth at least $1,050—which is actually more than the $1,000 that participating candidates are allowed to take from a wealthy donor. So, for participating candidates small contributions from average constituents can actually be worth more than big checks from wealthy donors. And, even the $20 or $35 that a single mother or blue-collar worker can spare becomes significant.
Right now most candidates treat fundraising and campaigning as two separate activities. They chase campaign cash from the donor class—dialing for dollars to Wall Street or seeking out lobbyists on K Street—and they search for votes at events back in their districts. And, because the costs of campaigns keeps rising they often spend much more time with donors who can give $1,000 or more than with voters who may only be able to chip in $50. Many (or even most) candidates actually hate dialing for dollars—but they play the game to win according to the current rules. Matching small contributions 6-to-1 or 9-to-1 can change this equation, freeing candidates to spend their time and energy courting constituents and seeking $50 or $100 contributions—which will now translate into significant resources for their campaigns. Candidates will spend more time hearing from average voters at barbeques, fish fries, constituent coffees, and door-knocking in their districts, and less chasing big money from the one percent.
No one law will completely transform Washington overnight. But, this proposal can change the way that Members of Congress run for office and who they listen to. Government in the U.S. responds almost exclusively to the preferences of the donor class because he who pays the piper calls the tune. For example, the very rich are much more concerned with deficits than job creation, and that focus has dominated conversations in Washington for the last several years. When Members of Congress can fund their campaigns with small contributions from their constituents they won’t face competing incentives when legislating. They can prioritize their constituents’ needs without worrying about how the next bill they sponsor will go over with lobbyists on K Street.
Yes. Different types of systems that use public funding to boost the power of small donors are in effect in Arizona, Connecticut, Maine, New York City, and many other places. Since Connecticut’s system took effect in 2008 more people are running for office and contributing to campaigns, lobbyists’ influence has declined, and policies the public wants like paid sick days and a stronger minimum wage have passed.15 New York City’s system is probably the most similar and has seen candidates rely much more heavily on small donors, the merging of fundraising with campaigning, and a more diverse donor pool.16
One of the problems with our current big money system is that large donors are much more likely to be white and male than the population as a whole. Cities and states that have tried programs intended to boost the power of small donors have generally seen increased diversity in both the donor and candidate pools, and we can expect the same at the federal level. For example in New York, 24 times more small donors from one poor, predominantly black neighborhood gave to City Council candidates (with a matching program) than to State Assembly candidates (without one).17 In Connecticut, both Latinos and women increased their representation in the legislature following the enactment of a public funding program. And, the program should increase economic diversity in the Congress as well. More than half of Congress are now millionaires,18 and just 2 percent have had working class backgrounds over the past century.19 This has a lot to do with the fact that in the current system it’s hard to get elected without a network of rich friends.
There are several provisions in the Government By the People Act that target and conserve public funds. First, candidates must demonstrate a threshold level of local public support to be eligible to receive any public funds. They must raise at least $50,000 from at least 1,000 people in their home states—not easy to do for fringe candidates. Next, all public funds are tied directly to private contributions. Unlike in past proposals, there are no lump sum grants. To access more public funds, candidates must convince more Americans to invest in their campaigns. Third, candidates can only carry over a limited amount of public funds into the next election cycle. And they have to spend one dollar of private funds for each dollar of public funds. So, there’s no incentive for those without viable opponents to keep drawing from the Freedom From Influence Fund and they can’t spend all the public money while hording private contributions. Finally, those who choose to access additional public funds available in the final 60 days of the campaign must give up their ability to carry over any public funds into future elections—so candidates will only choose to access this money if they really need it because they face a legitimate competitor.
This bill is designed with current campaign conditions in mind—including the constant threat of a barrage of outside spending. First, it’s important to remember that Super PACs play a significant role in a relatively small portion of House races, and usually in the general election. One of the core purposes of this proposal is to make it feasible for lots of ordinary Americans without extensive networks of wealthy friends and associates to run for office. This usually means running in a primary election, most often before Super PACs are engaged in the race. But, it works for expensive general elections too. Through it’s enhanced match program, the proposal provides the chance for candidates in highly competitive races to raise up to $500,000 in additional matching funds in the final 60 days of a general election. This provision is designed, in part, to give grassroots candidates a fighting chance against last-minute attacks by Super PACs or other outside spending groups. The caps on public funds are also designed to keep pace with the ever-increasing cost of campaigns. The caps are tied to the most expensive races in the previous cycle, so candidates who choose to participate in the program can rely on sufficient funds to remain competitive. These features should make the program attractive to many candidates for U.S. House, even those expecting tight races with significant outside spending.
Unfortunately, because of misguided Supreme Court rulings, we can’t prevent millionaires from attempting to buy public office by bankrolling their own campaigns. But, this bill doesn’t subsidize them. In order to qualify for public funds, candidates have to agree to strict limits on self-funding. 
It’s true that the Roberts Court is very hostile to even common-sense restrictions on the use of big money in politics. But this proposal focuses on raising the voices of average voters rather than imposing limits—so it’s clearly constitutional even under the Court’s unreasonable rulings. There are no mandatory contribution or spending limits and no matching funds “triggered” by outside or opposition spending. It clearly provides a way to reduce corruption and fight Americans’ belief that our politics are bought and sold, goals strongly supported by the current jurisprudence. In short, there’s nothing for the Court to object to in this bill.
It’s easy—a donor simply makes a small contribution to one or more candidates of her choice (no more than $300 per year to any one candidate) and saves a record of that contribution (either a paper receipt or an online confirmation). Then, at tax time, the donor will see a line item for the credit on her 1040A or 1040EZ form and lists the amount of her credit-eligible contributions (up to a $50 for an individual or $100 for a joint filer, translating to a $25 or $50 credit).
Only total contributions of up to $150 per election from the same donor are eligible for a public match. Since the second check would bring the contributor’s total to $200, the candidate must do one of two things: either return $50 to the donor, or return the public match she received on the first $100 to the Freedom From Influence Fund. Obviously in this case it will make much for sense for the candidate to return $50 to the donor and get a 6-to-1 or 9-to-1 match on $150 for a total of $1,050 or $1,500.
No, the bill sets up a special commission within the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to ensure that the program runs effectively and efficiently. Aside from this commission, most of the burden will fall on candidates who use the system, but they will find that the benefits—a significant public match on the funds they raise, and being able to focus their time listening to constituents—will far outweigh the administrative costs. The most complicated part will be keeping track of multiple contributions from the same donor to the same candidate so we know if a donor goes over the $150/election threshold and therefore none of her contributions are eligible for a public match. But, candidates already use software that assigns unique identifiers to individual donors and are already responsible for reporting the names, addresses, and employers of contributors who give several small contributions that add up to $200 or more over the course of an election cycle—so this is nothing new.
There’s some truth to the old sayings that you get what you pay for and he who pays the piper calls the tune. Someone is paying for candidates to run for office, and it can either be ordinary citizens, helped along with a limited amount of public funds, or it can be wealthy donors. Right now, most Americans believe—accurately—that government more responsive to donors than voters, and it’s undermining their faith in our democratic process.20 The extremely small cost of putting ordinary citizens at the center of political campaigns (a rounding error on our $3 trillion annual budget) can pay huge dividends in terms of government responsiveness to ordinary citizens and in turn voters’ confidence in the legitimacy of our democracy.
The CBO has not yet formally scored the bill, but even the high-end estimates would mean we’ll save many times the cost by eliminating boondoggles that are inevitable when politicians are accountable to large donors.  For example, following the enactment of a similar program in Connecticut, the state was able to save $24 million by returning unclaimed bottle deposits to the public rather than beverage companies.21 Savings at the federal level would be substantially larger.  And, we can offset the cost of the proposal by cutting tax subsidies for special interests.
Twenty-five dollar or even $100 contributions can feel insignificant to both donors and office-seekers when candidates for Congress are raising the majority of their funds in $1,000 and $2,500 checks. Why would a candidate knock on doors for days on end collecting small checks when she can attend one fundraiser at a law office or lobby firm and pull in $25,000 or $30,000 in two hours?
The Government By the People Act creates the Freedom from Influence Fund to change this dynamic. The point of the Fund is to amplify the voices of ordinary citizens and make a modest contribution worth a significant amount to a candidate, changing how (and with whom) candidates spend their time while running for office.
Here’s how it works:
Only Small Contributions Matched
The Fund provides a public match on small contributions to participating candidates—up to $150 per election (or $300 per election cycle). Larger contributions are not matched at all. In other words, the Fund does not match the first $150 of a $500 contribution. The match is targeted to truly small donors to amplify their voices and bring new people into the system. It does not subsidize the existing donor class.
Match Ratio
The match ratio depends upon how much a candidate wants to target her campaign to small donors (more on this below). The basic program provides a 6-to-1 match—so a $150 contribution is worth $1,050 to a participating candidate. Candidates who choose to further target their campaigns to small donors by accepting additional restrictions on their fundraising are eligible for a 50 percent bonus on this match. That same $150 contribution would then be worth $1,500.
Cap on Public Funds
There is a cap on the total amount of public matching funds a participating candidate may receive, and a cap on the amount of public funds a candidate may hold over for future elections.
For the baseline 6-to-1 match, public funds are capped at half of the cost of the 20 most expensive winning House campaigns from the previous cycle, which is currently about $3.25 million. For the 50 percent bonus enhanced match program, public funds are capped at the full cost of the 20 most expensive races, or approximately $6.5 million. And, in especially competitive races—campaigns that often feature lots of outside spending—participating candidates are eligible for an additional $500,000 in public funds in the final 60 days (further explanation in the “Enhanced Match Funds” section below).
Limits on Carrying Over Public Money for Future Elections
Candidates receiving the baseline 6-to-1 match are permitted to carry over $100,000 in public funds into the next election cycle. Candidates receiving the 50 percent enhanced match are permitted to carry over $200,000 into the next election cycle. Any carried-over public funds must be returned to the Freedom From Influence Fund if a candidate does not run for office again.
Participating candidates are permitted to carry over as many private funds as they wish; but they are required to spend $1 of private funds for every $1 of public funds (while they have private funds) so that they cannot horde private funds for carry-over purposes. These carry over limits reduce the incentive and ability for candidates in noncompetitive races to raise and then horde public funds.
These caps, along with the additional match described below, are designed to keep the program to a stable, predictable cost while still providing enough public funds to enable candidates to run viable, competitive campaigns within this system—which is essential for motivating candidates to choose to participate.
The Freedom From Influence Fund is targeted to candidates who will change the way they campaign; it is not designed to function as an additional source of money for candidates who are still seeking to fund their campaigns from lobbyists and the donor class. To facilitate this targeting, participating candidates must agree to certain fundraising restrictions.
To qualify for the baseline 6-to-1 match, candidates must:
To qualify for the 50 percent bonus on the 6-to-1 match, candidates must:
To safeguard public resources, only candidates who can demonstrate sufficient local grassroots support to run a viable campaign are eligible for matching funds. In order to qualify (for either the regular or “enhanced” match), candidates must secure at least 1,000 contributions from residents of their home state for a total of at least $50,000.
Most Americans believe there is too much money in politics.22 But, more troubling than the overall amount is the source of these funds. The core problem, as described above, is that too great a percentage of political money comes from a relative handful of wealthy donors, leaving elected officials accountable to the donor class rather than a broad swath of American voters. In addition to limiting the size of contributions (which can be difficult to do effectively under current Supreme Court precedent23), a key way to attack this problem is to motivate millions more middle and lower income people to make financial contributions, balancing out the influence of the rich. In addition to the matching funds described above, the Government By the People Act employs two strategies to bring more Americans into the process as small donors.
The My Voice Tax Credit
The Government By the People Act provides a $25 refundable 50 percent tax credit ($50 for joint filers) for taxpayers who contribute up to $300 in a single tax year to any U.S. House candidate. This means that someone who contributes $50 to a candidate can get $25 back at tax time and someone who contributes $100 and files jointly with a spouse can get $50 back—regardless of whether they have affirmative tax burden. The credit would be claimable on both the 1040A and 1040EZ tax forms.
This provision is intended to motivate millions of Americans to contribute to political campaigns who otherwise would not. It will function primarily as a tool for grassroots candidates who can reach out to ordinary voters and say “make a small contribution to my campaign and you can get half your money back.” It can also be used by constituency-based organizations to motivate their members to contribute to candidates they have endorsed.24
The fact that the credit is fully refundable is critical, and makes this tool for enhanced participation available to Americans across up and down the income ladder—not just the 57 percent of Americans who earn enough to incur a federal income tax burden.25
The tax credit is not a new idea, but rather a policy that has enjoyed support from presidents Kennedy, Truman and Eisenhower and benefited from years of experimentation on the federal and state levels.26Experience shows that a properly designed credit can be an effective way to increase financial participation by non-wealthy citizens.27
A federal tax credit similar to the one proposed existed from 1972-1986.28 At peak participation, more than 7 percent of eligible filers took advantage of the credit, compared with the estimated 2-3 percent of Americans who currently contribute to federal political campaigns.29 Unfortunately, the credit was not refundable and so did not reach the 43 percent of the population that does not incur federal income tax liability.
Analysis of state-level programs shows that contribution incentive programs are most effective when combined with other reforms.30 The tax credit in this bill should be particularly attractive when combined with the matching program described above, because a small donor can contribute $50, have that $50 matched six-to-one (or nine-to-one) and then receive $25 back—effectively turning a $25 cost into a $350 or $500 contribution.
The My Voice Voucher Pilot Program
In addition to the tax credit, the Government By the People Act includes a three-state federally funded pilot program to provide vouchers that eligible residents can use to make small contributions to federal candidates. Vouchers, like tax credits, are not a new idea—a voucher program was proposed at the federal level as early as 1967, and the idea has been championed by several scholars since.31
While a tax credit requires a contributor to give money out-of-pocket and receive a full or partial refund at tax time, a voucher provides up-front resources to be allocated to preferred candidates. This can be critical for citizens who are living paycheck-to-paycheck and may not feel they can afford to make a political contribution, even if they will get some of the money back at a later date. Research suggests that vouchers may go a long way towards reducing income or wealth as a factor in campaign giving.32
The voucher pilot program will provide an invaluable opportunity to test vouchers’ potential for engaging non-wealthy citizens and removing wealth as a primary factor in determining who contributes to political campaigns. If the program proves successful, it should be expanded nationwide.
The prospect of a last-minute barrage of spending by outside groups like Super PACs, trade associations, and 501(c) (4) nonprofits that can raise unlimited funds (often without disclosing their donors) has changed the face of modern campaigns. Many candidates are feeling pressure to build up larger and larger war chests to fend of this type of potential attack.33 Once thousands of ordinary citizens have invested in the campaign of a grassroots candidate, and these investments have been enhanced by public funds, we don’t want to see our voices drowned out by just a few millionaires and billionaires and our preferred candidates blown out of the water without any chance to fight back.
The Supreme Court has stymied our ability to prevent these spending onslaughts, but we can provide participating candidates with a fighting chance by helping them raise last-minute resources to fight back.
The Government By the People Act provides optional enhanced match support for participating candidates. Candidates who raise at least $50,000 in small contributions during the match period are eligible for up to $500,000 in public matching funds in the last 60 days of a general election campaign, regardless of whether they have already reached their cap on public funds. Small contributions (up to $150) are matched at a bonus rate of 50 percent above the candidate’s previous match rate. So, a candidate who was previously receiving a 6-to-1 match would receive a 9-to-1 match during this period; a candidate previously receiving a 9-to-1 match would receive a 13.5-to-1 match.
In order to conserve public funds and target this program to candidates who truly need the money because they are in competitive races (as opposed to those who would spend the money to build name recognition), candidates who make use of this enhanced match lose the ability to carry over any public funds into a future election cycle. In the final months of a campaign, each participating candidate will face a choice. If the campaign is a break-the-bank race featuring a barrage of outside spending, she will likely take advantage of the further match and sacrifice her ability to carry funds over into the next cycle. If it is not a particularly high-spending race (and most races across the country won’t be), she will likely forgo the additional public funds in favor of starting her next election with some funds in the bank.
Political Action Committees (PACs) have a bad name. Most people associate them with special interests influence peddling. But, there’s nothing inherently wrong with a PAC— it is simply a tool for people to aggregate their political power to contribute to or advocate for candidates of their choice. The problem with traditional federal PACs is that they can accept contributions of up to $5,000 per year—nearly 10 percent of median household income, and well beyond what all but the wealthiest Americans can afford to give. Super PACs are even worse—providing a convenient vehicle for millionaires, billionaires, and for-profit corporations to use to dominate elections. So, in practice, PACs serve to aggregate the power of wealthy people and interests, not average citizens.
People PACs capture all of the benefits of a PAC as an organizing tool without the downside of exacerbating the advantages of wealth. People PACs can raise contributions of up to $150 per year from individuals. They can give the same $5,000 to candidates, or make unlimited independent expenditures (as Supreme Court precedent requires).
A $5,000 contribution from a PAC to a candidate is neither corrupting nor unfair when those funds originated in dozens of small contributions that average Americans can afford to give.
Anyone can set up a People PAC to organize his or her fellow citizens. Nonprofit corporations, unions, businesses or individuals would all be permitted to use this tool. Even political parties can start People PACs, and as an incentive for them to do so the Government By the People Act permits parties to make unlimited expenditures that are coordinated with candidates using People PAC funds.34
Like tax credits and vouchers, People PACs are not a new idea. Colorado, for example, currently has “small donor committees” that can accept contributions of up to $50 from natural persons (as opposed to $500 for other committees) and make contributions to candidates ten times larger than other political committees ($5,000 to statewide candidates and $2,000 to state legislative candidates as opposed to $500 and $200 respectively).35",research
"How America’s Big-Box Retailers Turn Their Economic Power into Political Influence
The notion that all citizens have a voice in our country’s governance is at the center of the American ideal of democracy. Yet the role of corporate and private money in our political system means that the voices of the majority are often drowned out by those with the most money. The political spending of the country’s largest big-box retailers demonstrates how firms with low-wage business models turn massive profits into political leverage, embedding the inequality they perpetuate in the economy into the political system. This report examines the federal campaign spending and lobbying of the nation’s top earning big-box retailers, and finds that it is large and growing, and targeted at maintaining their economic power through political influence. 
 
The notion that all citizens have a voice in our country’s governance is at the center of the American ideal of democracy. Yet the role of corporate and private money in our political system means that the voices of the majority are often drowned out by those with the most money. Campaign and committee donations help wealthy interests determine who runs for office and who wins elections. This effect, combined with millions of dollars in lobbying, allows the biggest spenders to shape the country’s political agenda and gives them disproportionate influence over the policymaking process. As a result, the minority population of affluent Americans see their priorities reflected in our legislative objectives, even when the majority of the country disagrees with their preferences.1 This problematic political spending entrenches economic inequality and political power in a system where legitimacy hinges on equality and self-determination. Under this regime the economic advantages held by companies like Walmart can be leveraged to yield legislative returns. The political spending of big retailers reveals how extreme disparity not only subverts our economic promise; it undermines our democratic principles and our government’s commitment to the public good. 
In this report we examine the federal election spending of the six big-box retail companies with earnings ranked among the top retail companies in the country, using newly available data from the Center for Responsive Politics. We find that their reach is pervasive, reflected in enormous and growing expenditures to influence electoral and policy outcomes. Among this group, Walmart is the biggest spender by a wide margin, with $2.4 million in donations through its Political Action Committee (PAC) and individual donations and $12.5 million in lobbying expenses during the 2014 electoral cycle—spending about three times more than its nearest rival, Home Depot. This political spending is a problem for democracy, because extensive research suggests that the domination of wealth in our electoral process can significantly affect public policy, and that the priorities of the affluent often diverge from majority opinion.2 On issues like taxation, economic regulation, Social Security, and the minimum wage, the differences can be stark.
 
There has been a dramatic mobilization of political power among America’s largest big-box retailers over the past four election cycles, with federal campaign and lobbying expenditures growing from $5.2 million during the 2000 political cycle to $29.8 million during the 2014 cycle, an almost six-fold increase. Even that number massively underestimates retail’s reach by excluding state and local elections, as well as contributions to 501(c)3 and 501(c)6 groups like the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) and the Chamber of Commerce. The fastest increases in retail political spending over the period appeared with the 2008 election cycle. Total campaign and lobbying expenditures grew by 95 percent in that cycle, driven by lobbying expenditures that more than doubled. In the 2010 midterm election cycle, lobbying topped $25 million. Political spending by big-box retailers peaked at a total of $33.7 million in 2012—the following presidential election year (see Figure 1).

Not all major retailers spend alike, even among the market’s most profitable corporate membership. Two retailers from our list—Walmart and Home Depot—are ranked among the top 100 political donors overall for the period since 1989, a level that earns the designation “Heavy Hitters” from the Center for Responsive Politics.3 Target and Best Buy, though not distinguished by campaign contributions, amass enormous federal spending totals through their lobbying efforts. Costco’s total federal spending falls at the bottom of the list, with campaign contributions of $2 million over the entire 15-year period and no lobbying expenditures at all (see Figure 2).

The retail firms with the largest federal political spending—like Walmart and Home Depot—exemplify the relationship between economic and democratic inequity. Walmart is the industry’s largest political spender as well as the world’s largest retailer and private employer, distinctions that give the company considerable influence over labor and product markets in the U.S. and beyond. In markets, Walmart draws upon this economic clout to exacerbate the inequality at the core of its business model. When Walmart comes to town, retail workers see their wages drop and employment growth recede.4 At the same time, the company’s $16 billion in annual profits are channeled to a much smaller pool of earners, namely the Walton heirs, who inherited their vast wealth from Walmart founders Sam and Bud Walton and today rank among the richest billionaires in the world. The practices are emblematic of the growing concentration of wealth and income at the top of the U.S. economy, a trend that has been linked to slow growth, rising volatility, and even poor sales performance for companies like Walmart whose revenues depend on consumer spending.5 
But markets are not the only institutions that respond to the outsized power of Walmart and companies like it. There is strong evidence that an important impact of campaign contributions is to shape the views of candidates seeking to run viable campaigns and help candidates with friendly policy views win office, in addition to increasing access to politicians with the intent of setting the political agenda.6 Studies of the telecommunications industry show that regulators respond to private political spending with regulations that favor the donors.7 And companies that bid for federal contracts across industries are more likely to be granted those contracts if the bids are complemented by campaign contributions.8 This evidence suggests that political spending provides highly profitable companies like Walmart with the opportunity to influence the conversation in a way that reflects their bottom lines at democracy’s expense and to use campaign contributions and lobbying to leverage their economic power into law (see Figure 3).

The majority of Walmart’s public shares are owned by the Walton family heirs, who have shown a penchant for political engagement. Over recent years, the family has consolidated their ownership in the company and seen their private wealth balloon. Since the beginning of the Great Recession in 2007, the Walton family wealth has grown by 96 percent while the typical American household’s net worth fell by 40 percent.9 The spectacular growth of the Walton family’s affluence can be linked, in part, to decades of political influence. According to Bloomberg News, the Waltons started lobbying for a repeal of the estate tax in the 1990s, and continue to exploit obscure tax loopholes that protect the assets of the country’s richest heirs.10 In a prime example of the revolving door between the private interests of the affluent and policymakers, one Arkansas Congresswoman who supported the repeal of the estate tax and received $83,650 in campaign donations from Walmart works as a lobbyist for the company today.11 In the period since the late 1990s, the Walton family has spent more than half a million dollars on lobbying through its foundation, Walton Enterprises.
Demos examined Walton family political contributions over the period between 2000 and 2014 and found that the Waltons made a total of $7.3 million in campaign contributions over the period, with greater total contributions in presidential election years (see Figure 4). The Waltons achieve broad access by contributing to both parties, but their spending heavily favors Republican candidates and PACs. Since 2000, Walton family campaign contributions included $6 million to Republican candidates and PACs, $1 million to Democrats, and $236,085 to independent or non-affiliated candidates. These numbers reveal a savvy investment in their political interests, but still far understate Walton family’s influence through other means. For example the Walton Family Foundation—not included in our calculations here—is one of the biggest education funders in the country, with an emphasis on supporting the privatization of K-12 education.12 Their use of private lobbyists and spending at the state and local levels is also not included in our calculations.


Although retail political spending is both deep and broad, retailers overwhelmingly support Republicans over Democrats. Since 2000, the country's largest big-box retailers donated to Republicans over Democrats by a margin of more than 2-to-1 (see Figure 6 & 7). Walmart—which donated to a total of 295 different candidates in the most recent election cycle—gave $1 to Democrats for every $2 donated to Republican campaigns or PACs (see Figure 8). That compares to even greater Republican leanings at Target, Home Depot, Best Buy, and Lowe's, which gave $2.14, $2.95, $3.03, and $3.50 to Republicans for every $1 to Democrats, respectively. Costco was the only company that had a strong Democratic preference, allocating just $0.04 to Republicans for every $1 in Democratic spending. But since Costco’s total spending was far lower than other retailers, its donations to Democrats over the period still amounted to less than those of big spenders Walmart and Home Depot, despite their biases.


This is unsurprising—Republicans are often seen as the party of big business. Over the last two years, House Republicans have unanimously voted against raising the minimum wage and attempted to eliminate Davis-Bacon protections.13 At the same time, they fought to extend the Bush Tax Cuts and made 50 attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.14 The Senate has taken similar stands on behalf of corporate interests: all Republicans but one signed onto a bill to stop new NLRB rules and all but one voted against the Buffet rule that would ensure that the wealthiest one percent pay a 30% income tax rate.15
The influence of wealthy corporate donors has concrete results. Research suggests that campaign contributions like those examined here can significantly affect policy. For example, a recent article in the National Tax Journal finds that increases in business campaign contributions lead to lower state corporate taxes.16 This outcome exacerbates inequities because companies like Walmart rely on a business model that depends on tax payers to support their low-wage workforce, while simultaneously aiming their political spending to reduce their own tax burdens.17 Congressional votes to hold down the value of the minimum wage are another example. Polls consistently show that a majority of American voters favor raising the minimum wage. But while 78 percent of the general public favors a minimum that would bring full time workers and their families above the poverty line, only 40 percent of wealthy Americans agree.18 Organizations representing the minority opinion, like the Chamber of Commerce, have spent tens of millions of dollars to advance their position in legislatures.19 And policymakers have allowed the real value of the federal minimum wage to erode for the past 5 years.
 
With the exception of Costco, all of the country's largest big-box retailers spend significant and growing amounts of money on lobbying. Over the period studied, the companies spent a total of $111 million lobbying congress on various bills.20 This avenue of spending has grown considerably in recent election cycles, from $2.3 million in 2000 to a peak of $26.5 million in the 2012 election cycle (see Figure 9). 
Retailers lobby on a variety of issues, including tax policy, labor issues, and the terms of international trade.21 A vast literature shows that these efforts produce returns, often at the expense of other democratic interests.22 In a comprehensive study of such conflicts, researchers found that business interests prevailed in 9 out of 11 issues in which businesses and labor were opposed.23 The ability of companies to win policy outcomes through massive spending on behalf of their financial interests is problematic for a Congress charged with serving the people.

Taxes were the most frequently lobbied issue by big-box retailers in 2014 by a large margin. This legislative area has proven lucrative for business in the past—experts in corporate strategy research show that a 1 percent increase in businesses lobbying expenditures yields a lower effective tax rate of between 0.5 and 1.6 percent for the firm.24 One study on the subject finds that the market value of an additional dollar spent on lobbying could be as high as $200.25  In 2014, the largest big-box retailers reported lobbying on a total of 37 incidences of specific taxation, including corporate tax reform, internet sales tax, and the extension of temporary tax breaks. The next most common issues of lobbying were health care reform, labor, antitrust, and workplace regulations.
 
Campaign spending and lobbying by moneyed interests is not new to American politics, but it has expanded significantly over the past 15 years. The total political spending of the country's largest big-box retailers grew 6 times over in the years from 2000 to 2014—reaching almost $30 million in the 2014 cycle. These companies and their wealthy owners have increasingly used their massive profits to lobby against the interests of their own workforce and to reduce their responsibility for sustaining the economic system from which they prosper. Accounting for this outsized spending is important because evidence shows that when the priorities of the affluent diverge from majority opinion, policy reflects the preferences of the donor class. Big-box retailers have expressed their preferences emphatically on both sides of the aisle concerning issues like taxation, health care coverage, and unionization rights. 
The political spending at retail’s largest companies exemplifies the relationship between economic and democratic inequity. Walmart, in particular, stands out as one of the top political donors in the entire country and the largest retail corporate political spender. Federal political spending by Walmart and the company’s wealthy family heirs embeds the economic disparity at the heart of their low-wage business model into the democratic system. 
New policies to mitigate the disproportionate political influence of the affluent minority are a critical step toward a stronger democracy and an economy that works for more than just the wealthy few. A federal matching system for small donations would amplify the voices currently drowned out by big donors, and provide an incentive for candidates to give greater attention to citizens who cannot afford to spend millions of dollars in order to be heard. Research suggests that such programs increase the racial and economic diversity of donors.26 Alternatively, publicly funding elections would protect candidates from floods of corporate and private spending by wealthy donors, and from their disproportionate influence over campaigns. Finally, research suggests that lobbying regulations lead legislators to weigh citizens’ opinions more equally.27 Since lobbying expenditures were an important factor in the rise of big-box retailers’ political spending, responsible oversight of this spending is crucial to ensuring that all Americans have an equal voice. It is time to tell retailers that democracy is not for sale.
Measures of political spending require compilation of multiple data sources. This report draws from data secured by the Center for Responsive Politics. Open Secrets provided data on the political spending of Walton family members from 2000 to 2014. On their website, OpenSecrets.org, lobbying data are available by company and PAC and campaign spending are available by company, PAC, and individuals. This report adds contiguous years together to examine expenditures over an election cycle. Elections spending data for 2014 are incomplete and thus understate annual spending in that year. The retailer data were collected during the week of November 3, 2014. The Walton family data were collected during the week of September 8, 2014.  
The data in this report does not include Walton family spending through their foundations or lobbying, nor state and local spending for any retailers nor the Walton family. These data do not include the money that companies spend on industry groups (501(c)6s) like the Chamber of Commerce. As a result, even the large numbers we present represent only a portion of the retail and Walton family influence over the political system. Our numbers are inflation-adjusted to 2013 dollars, except for 2014 data.",research
"Who is spending big money on elections, and what do they want?
Over the last three decades, the Supreme Court has curtailed meaningful limits on political campaign spending and contributions. The alarming, but predictable, result is the rise of a small group of wealthy elites who make large political contributions with the goal of influencing election outcomes and policymaking. We are left with a government that is less responsive to the needs and concerns of ordinary Americans, and more responsive to the needs and concerns of economic elites.
To understand what big money in politics means, it is important to understand the “who” and the “what” of political donations: who is spending big money on elections, and what do they want? 
In the following analysis, we uncover the demographics (the “who) and policy preferences (the “what”) of the donor class that dominates U.S. campaign funding, in order to shed light on why money in politics is distorting our democracy in favor of economic elites, and particularly white male elites. Drawing on unique data sets and original data analyses, for the first time we are able to see who is—and is not—represented among big political donors and how their policy concerns differ. The data reveal that the donor class is in fact profoundly unrepresentative of the American population as a whole, and particularly of low-income people and people of color. Our analysis encompasses federal elections in 2012, 2014 and 2016. Some of our key findings include
Demos’ findings in this report shed disturbing new light on the deep inequalities embedded in our big-money elections, and help to explain how political inequality is intertwined with growing economic inequality. 
This report sharply underscores the urgent need for comprehensive reforms to reverse the dominance of big money in politics. While the Supreme Court has substantially narrowed the scope of potential reforms, public funding of elections is one significant reform that we can implement immediately, particularly with the goal of empowering small (less than $200) and very small donors in the election process. The longer-term but no less important need revealed by this report is to reverse the Supreme Court’s stance on reasonable limits on campaign spending and contributions. 
A democracy that does not give equal voice to all people within its governance is a democracy in name only. As we demonstrate here, the political donor class is far from representative of the American people as a whole and particularly of lower-income residents and people of color, who need representation the most. In this light, it is clear that if we do not establish meaningful limits on the role of big money in politics, our democracy cannot fulfill its promise of serving the needs of the many over the preferences of the few.

In spite of persistently high unemployment and an unremarkable deficit-to-GDP ratio, and in spite of public polling that consistently showed that creating jobs was  the American public’s top priority, politicians inside the infamous Washington “Beltway” had spent months locked in a debate over ways to cut deficits and balance the federal budget—policies that would not create jobs and by some estimates would put millions out of work.

America’s public transit, however, received a D-minus grade from the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2017, down from a D grade in the prior “report card.” In New York City, the subway system is in a “state of emergency” and has been compared to a “patient that has suffered severe trauma.” In Washington, D.C., the subway system is hobbled by a backlog of repairs and a lack of funding. In Chicago, the transit authority is underfunded and is considering service cuts. But these are actually some of the best cities for public transportation, because they have well-developed, if ailing and underfunded, systems. “Many Americans still have inadequate access to public transit,” the Civil Engineers pointed out.
While people use public transit for trips to many destinations, travel to work is one of the most important. All racial and ethnic groups rely on public transit for travel to work, but people of color rely on it disproportionately. The Demos report To Move Is to Thrive: Public Transit and Economic Opportunity for People of Color details the importance of public transit to workers of color.

In other words, Latino workers are almost 3 times as likely, and Asian-American and African-American workers are almost 4 times, as likely as white workers to commute by public transit.

That fell to 43 percent last year and 36 percent this year. Democrats, meanwhile, have gradually become more positive about higher education, with 72 percent this year viewing higher ed as having a positive effect, up from 65 percent in 2010.
Even so, observers on both the left and the right said the Education Next findings are interesting but not necessarily surprising.

"It’s worth noting, first of all, that black and Hispanic college students are more likely to have to borrow to pay for a college education and that they end up having to borrow more money to cover college costs. A study from Demos analyzing federal data found that 86 percent of black students and 87 percent of Hispanic students got loans to attend private universities, compared to 72 percent of whites. (At public universities, 81 percent of black students got loans to 61 percent of whites.)

"If the twin threats to public pensions continue, African American retirees may lose much of the retirement security they’ve gained over the past half-century.
Public sector jobs, with the pensions they provide, have been one of the most important ways for black families to enter the middle class since the 1960s, when civil rights legislation and the expansion of the federal government opened the door for African American workers to enter public service. In particular, the establishment of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which was responsible for enforcing workforce anti-discrimination provisions in the Act, and President Johnson’s 1965 Executive Order 11246, which prohibited government contractors from discriminating on the basis of race and other categories, created opportunities for black workers to enter civil service en masse.1 Between 1961 and 1965, black workers were hired for 28 percent of new positions in the federal government despite comprising just 10 percent of the U.S. population.2  The importance of public sector employment for African American workers has continued to the present day, with 21.2 percent of all black women and 15.4 percent of all black men working in the public sector, compared to 17.5 percent and 11.8 percent of white women and men, respectively.3
Despite decades of efforts to reduce employment discrimination in the private sector, public employment remains important to African American workers as a source of income security, helping to close the wage gap between white and black workers. In 2014, black private sector workers earned just 78 percent, on average, of the wages of their white counterparts. In the public sector, however, this gap was significantly smaller: black public sector workers earned 90 percent of the wages of white public sector workers.4 Even when broken down by education level, the earnings gap between black and white workers was smaller in the public sector for workers of all levels.   
As important as public employment is to the black middle class, the pensions provided by public employment are perhaps even more crucial to the retirement security of black workers. This brief uses data from the Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement5 to examine the importance of public pensions to black retirement security, and why the twin threats to public pensions—cuts to state pension benefits and the decline in public employment over the past two decades—particularly threaten the retirement security of African American workers. We find that public pensions are vital to ensuring a decent standard of living for black retirees: the poverty rate among black retirees without public pensions is nearly 20 percent higher than the poverty rate among black retirees with public pensions—almost double the difference in poverty rates between all retirees with and without public pensions. These figures show that if the twin threats to public pensions continue, African American retirees may lose much of the retirement security they’ve gained over the past half-century.
 
Over the past twenty years, many of the African American workers who entered public service during the boom in black public employment in the middle of the last century have begun to retire. As Figure 1 shows, over the past two decades the share of black retirees6 with public pensions has increased sharply as well, from 9.8 percent to 11.4 percent, mirroring the rise in the overall share of retirees with pensions. The median pension7 has also risen, increasing more than 11 percent since 1994. Looking by gender, smaller shares of retired women of all races have public pensions than do men; women’s pensions are smaller than men’s as well, though both gaps have narrowed in the past two decades. The share of retired black women in 2014 with public pensions, 11.7 percent, has caught up to the share of black male retirees with public pensions, 11.0 percent, up from 8.9 percent and 11 percent, respectively, in 1994. 

Public pension income is particularly important to African American retirees, providing a larger share of income for them than for retirees of other races and ethnicities. Figure 2 depicts the shares of retirement income that retirees receive from five major income categories: Social Security, wages, public pensions, other pensions (including defined contribution plans and private defined benefit plans), and other income (including income from interest, dividends, businesses, farms, and rent). It shows that in 2014, public pensions and Social Security together accounted for 57 percent of black retirees’ income compared to 49 percent for white retirees. By gender, Social Security accounted for a far larger share of the retirement income of women of all races in 2014 than it did for men; conversely, other pension income made up a smaller share of women’s retirement income than it did men’s. Social Security and public pension income is particularly important for black women: together, the two income sources accounted for 63 percent of the total retirement income of black women, the highest share of any race and gender; black men, in comparison, received 51 percent of their income from the two sources combined.8

Figure 2 also illustrates another important trend: the increasing share of retirement income provided by wages for all retirees. Between 1994 and 2014, the overall share of retirement income from wages increased from 3 percent to 15 percent, due to the increasing number of older Americans who continue to work after taking Social Security. Although many of them are in the upper half of the income distribution, many Americans in the bottom half of the income distribution are working past age 65 as well. Various factors drive this trend of older and post-retirement work, but the biggest contributors are the increase in the Social Security Full Retirement Age from 65 to 67, the decline in labor force participation of younger Americans (largely because of increased pursuit of higher education), delayed family formation by younger Americans, and the decline of private pensions—each of which has either forced or incentivized older Americans to work longer.9
Examining the incomes and poverty rates of retirees with and without public pensions provides the most striking evidence of black retirees’ reliance on public pensions. Figure 3 shows that the median income in 2014 for retirees without public pensions was near or below the individual poverty line ($11,367 a year in 2015) for retirees of any race, because the majority of retirees without public pensions rely on Social Security for nearly all of their retirement income.10  For African American retirees and other retirees of color, a public pension is literally the difference between a secure retirement and one spent in or near poverty. 

The importance of public pensions to black retirement security is perhaps mostly starkly illustrated by the huge difference between the poverty rates of black retirees with and without public pensions. Less than 3 percent of black retirees with public pensions lived below the poverty line in 2014, which is nearly 87 percent lower than the 21.8 percent of black retirees without public pensions who lived in poverty, as shown in Figure 4. Black retirees were nearly twice as reliant on public pensions to provide a secure retirement as the retiree population as a whole.

Public pensions make an even greater difference in the poverty rates for retired women. Higher shares of retired women of all races live in poverty than do retired men, both for retirees with and without public pensions. Public pensions make the greatest difference in retirees’ chance of being in poverty for black women: nearly a quarter (24 percent) of retired black women without public pensions are in poverty, while just 3 percent of black women with public pensions are. This is a significantly larger difference than for retired black men: 19 percent of retired black men without public pensions are in poverty, compared to 3 percent of retired black men with them. 
 
Given the crucial role of public pensions in African American retirement security, the decline of both public sector employment and the pensions these jobs offer has already hurt the retirement prospects of current black workers; if this decline continues, the impact on black retirement security may be catastrophic. The reduction in public employment has meant fewer stable middle-class jobs for black workers, who have relied on public employment as a pathway to the middle class for more than half a century. The cuts to public pensions mean that even for those black workers fortunate enough to get one of the shrinking pool of public sector jobs, they’re forced to shoulder an increasingly large share of the retirement security burden. And given the poverty rates cited above for black retirees without public pensions, we can predict that the impact of these cuts will be grim indeed.
Figure 5 shows total federal, state, and local government employment between 1994 and 2014. Although total public employment has risen slightly—by about 9 percent—over the past two decades, the total U.S. labor force grew much faster over the same period, rising by 21 percent. This means that the share of all workers employed by the government has fallen since 1994, reducing government’s capacity to serve our ever-growing population. If the share of workers in public employment had merely held constant over the past 20 years, there would be nearly 2.3 million more public jobs today; this is the “missing” public employment that Figure 5 depicts. Given that 14.3 percent of public workers in 2014 were black, this translates to almost 320,000 lost public jobs for black workers in the past two decades, a huge blow for the black middle class and their retirement security. Figure 6 breaks down the missing public employment by race/ethnicity based on current composition of the public employee workforce.


In addition to the decline in economic security during workers’ careers, this missing public employment will impact workers’ future retirement security as well.  Figure 7 shows the projected additional number of retirees living in poverty due to lost pensions from missing public employment.11 We project that more than 275,000 additional workers will suffer impoverished retirements from these cuts, including nearly 70,000 black retirees. In this way, missing public employment is really a double blow to workers, hitting them with decreased economic security and a lower standard of living both during their working lifetimes and after they retire. 

The impact of the recent cuts to public pensions is harder to quantify, because we won’t know how the cuts have affected workers’ retirement security until the workers affected by the cuts retire. The majority of African American retirees in 2014 who worked in the public sector began their careers between the 1960s and 1980s, before the recent waves of pension cuts were enacted. However, by examining the breadth and magnitude of recent cuts, we can form a reasonable prediction of their effects on the retirement security of future retirees. 
Unfortunately, in the past five years, state pension cuts have been widespread. Figure 8 maps state pension cuts since 2009. Thirty-four states have either cut benefits for new workers, raised their retirement age (which is effectively a benefit cut) or increased workers’ required pension contributions (which, though not a benefit cut, is in essence a salary cut), or enacted multiple reductions, as has happened in the majority of states that have made pension cuts.12 And these cuts have been far from minor: in the 24 states that made direct cuts to pension benefits—i.e. changed the formula by which benefits are calculated—such cuts averaged 7.5 percent of a future retiree’s projected annual benefit.13 Nine states cut benefits by 10 percent or more, and four—Alabama, Maryland, New Mexico, and Pennsylvania—cut benefits by at least 19 percent. These cuts mean that public workers in these 24 states will have to save an average of an additional $50,022 each in individual retirement savings to replace the retirement income lost through the cuts enacted in just the past 5 years. 

The twin threats of declining public sector employment and cuts to public pensions pose a grave threat to the retirement security of current and future African American workers. The overall poverty rate of black retirees in 2014 was 19.7 percent, 75 percent higher than the overall retiree poverty rate of 11.3 percent. If public jobs continue to disappear and public pensions continue to be cut, future black public workers will be forced to rely on defined contribution plans—401(k)s, IRAs, etc.—to supplement Social Security to provide adequate retirement income. But the documented failure of 401(k)-type plans14 to provide retirement security for private sector workers make this a dangerous path indeed.15 The high fees and multitude of risks that 401(k)s force savers to shoulder make these plans entirely unsuitable to be workers’ primary supplement to Social Security for retirement income. Clear evidence of the insufficiency of 401(k)-type plans is apparent in the incomes of retirees without public pensions, illustrated in Figure 3 above. As the figure showed, the median income of retirees without public pensions in 2014 was just $17,184, meaning that more than half of private-sector retirees receive nearly all of their income from Social Security, leaving them far from the dignified retirement once promised to most hard-working Americans.
Why are 401(k)s such inadequate replacements for defined benefit pensions? Workers with 401(k)s find their retirement savings exposed to a number of significant risks and costs, which together make it difficult for workers to save enough for retirement to maintain their standard of living. Defined benefit pensions largely protected workers from these risks and costs, which explains a significant share of the gap in retirement income, depicted in Figure 3 above, between workers with and without public defined benefit pensions. These risks include: 
For a more in-depth explanation of the risks of 401(k)s and the impact of fees on retirement savings, see two prior Demos papers: The Failure of the 401(k) and The Retirement Savings Drain.
 
If we wish to prevent the erosion of the retirement security of African American workers, and all workers, we need a significant shift in our country’s retirement policy. And we need to act now, before this erosion becomes too difficult to stop. Moreover, we also need to strengthen retirement security for those workers, particularly private sector workers, who are at risk of poverty or significantly-lowered living standards in retirement. Ensuring retirement security for all workers, particularly those most vulnerable or at-risk, requires substantial policy change, equal to the magnitude of the growing retirement crisis. To truly confront the crisis, we need to reform and strengthen each of the three legs of the apocryphal “three-legged stool” of retirement security: public defined benefit pensions, individual retirement savings, and Social Security.  
By protecting existing public pensions, creating new retirement savings accounts for private sector workers that provide many of the benefits of defined benefit plans, and protecting and strengthening Social Security, we can ensure that workers today and in the future—particularly workers of color—have the chance to retire with dignity, a key part of the American dream. ",policy-briefs
"On June 26, 2006, the U.S. Supreme Court announced its decision in Randall v. Sorrell, a case addressing the constitutionality of Vermont’s comprehensive campaign finance law, enacted in 1997. The Court was badly splintered on the reasoning, but the bottom-line vote was to strike Vermont’s spending limits as well as its contribution limits. This is not the result that reformers hoped for; neither does the decision realize the worst fears that some had about the outcome. The splintered rationales of the six opinions reflect the continued lack of consensus on the Court on how to address the conflicting constitutional values at stake in the campaign finance debate. This memo outlines how the Justices lined up on the issues, provides some analysis of the opinions, and touches on the implications for future reform efforts.

"Americans of all political backgrounds agree: there is way too much corporate money in politics. Nine in 10 Americans (89%) agree with that statement, and 51 percent strongly agree. More than 80 percent of every ideological and partisan subgroup expressed agreement that there is way too much corporate money in politics.1
These are some of the findings of a new poll commissioned by the Corporate Reform Coalition, of which Demos is a part. The survey explored Americans’ attitudes toward corporate political spending and found that they believe that it drowns out the voices of average Americans and corrupts our democratic government. It also found overwhelming support for strong, common sense reforms to ensure transparency and accountability for corporate political spending, should it occur, and for systemic solutions to the problem of the role of money in politics.  

 
Eighty one percent of Americans agree that the secret flow of corporate political spending is bad for democracy.2 Our democratic system of government works when we are all political equals. When corporate political spending can distort the political discourse, dictate the policy agenda, and determine who is able to run and win as a candidate for elected office, it strikes at the heart of our democratic society. In fact, 7 out of 10 Americans (70%) believe a ban on corporate funded political ads would improve politics in this country;3 a majority is in favor of a constitutional amendment to ban all corporate political spending.4
Huge majorities of Americans across the political spectrum condemn corporate political spending:
Support for these propositions does not fall beneath 72 percent amongst the Democrats, Republicans, or Independents, or liberals, conservatives, and moderates surveyed, and reaches as high as 94 percent.11

 
Corporations are established through state law and, as such, should not be beyond democratic accountability.12 As the Supreme Court noted before its recent sharp turn towards campaign finance deregulation, corporations “receive from the State the special benefits conferred by the corporate structure and present the potential for distorting the political process.”13 When corporations are given a First Amendment right to flood the airwaves with their messages, they can overpower the voices of other citizens whose constitutional right to political speech deserves no less protection than those with greater financial resources. This undermines the political equality that gives our democratic government legitimacy. 
Americans understand that a government beholden to corporate money is not ideally suited to serve the best interests of the American people. In fact, 3 out of 4 Americans (75%) agree that corporate political spending helps companies block new laws in Congress that would help consumers.14 This runs counter to the public interest and was recognized across the political and ideological spectrum:

Americans clearly understand that corporations spend money on politics in order to extract their own benefits from government. Economists deride the process of rent seeking, whereby one company seeks advantage over another not through economic competition in a free marketplace on the strengths of their goods and services, but by advantaging themselves through non-competitive means. Americans understand this dynamic. More than 7 out of 10 (72%) agree that corporations spend money on politics to gain an economic advantage over their competitors, and over 38 percent strongly agree.17 But what can be good for one company can be rotten for the market as a whole - not to mention the public.
Americans also understand the scourge of a pay to play system that wastes taxpayer money and results in contracts being awarded on the basis of political favoritism instead of merit. Seven out of 10 Americans (73%) agree that corporations spend money on politics to get government contracts, and 39 percent strongly agree.18
The American people can see the reality of the corrupting influence of money in politics with greater acumen than the Supreme Court. Eighty-five percent of Americans call it corruption when financial supporters have more access and influence with members of Congress than average Americans – 57 percent say this is very corrupt. Americans believe that government is corrupted when a member of Congress does a business or individual a favor because they received financial support (90%), acts in the interests of financial supporters instead of in the interests of constituents (89%), or acts in the interests of financial supporters instead of in his or her best judgment (87%). Americans agree with these statements by margins of almost or just over 80%. 
And yet our Supreme Court is supremely out of touch. In Citizens United Justice Kennedy wrote that “[t]he fact that speakers may have influence over or access to elected officials does not mean that these officials are corrupt. ... Ingratiation and access, in any event, are not corruption.”19 Justice Kennedy decided that “independent expenditures do not lead to, or create the appearance of quid pro quo corruption”20 and therefore the government’s interest in protecting itself against corruption did not serve to justify laws prohibiting “independent”21 corporate political spending. Only a few years earlier the Court was far closer to the public’s understanding that corruption of government is “not confined to bribery of public officials, but extend[s] to the broader threat from politicians too compliant with the wishes of large contributors.”22 

The Supreme Court has said many times that protecting against the appearance of corruption is a compelling interest vital to the protection of democratic government. The Court has recognized the danger that voters will grow cynical and choose not to participate in a system they think is rigged. Less than a decade before the ban on corporate political spending was struck down in Citizens United, the Supreme Court had upheld the ban, writing: “‘[t]ake away Congress’ authority to regulate the appearance of undue influence and `the cynical assumption that large donors call the tune could jeopardize the willingness of voters to take part in democratic governance.’”23
Yet already a huge majority of Americans are worried about special interests buying elections and about the corruption of our democratic government. Forty one percent of Americans worry very often about the corruption of government, another 21 percent worry fairly often, and 24 percent worry about it occasionally. Taken together, 86 percent of Americans are worried about corruption of our government. Eighty two percent of Americans are very often, fairly often, or occasionally worried about special interests buying elections. The same percentage of Americans are very or fairly often worried about the corruption of government (62%) as they are worried by special interests buying elections (62%).
 
This state of affairs cries out for reform before unaccountable corporate money in our elections becomes the new normal. In a case overruled by Citizens United, the Court decried “the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public’s support for the corporation’s political ideas.”24 Unfortunately, short of a constitutional amendment or a return to the Supreme Court’s earlier understanding of the dynamics of money in politics and the duty of government to protect the democratic sphere, current options are limited. But there are several strong, achievable reforms that would temper the democratic distortion and corrosion that we face.
By huge margins Americans confirm that if corporations are going to engage in political spending, that spending must be controlled by shareholders and accountable to the public. Eight out of 10 Americans (80%) agree that corporations should only spend money on political campaigns if they get approval from their shareholders first, which would be an important step towards allowing investors to control the political activities of the companies they own. Support for that proposition was at 78 percent among Republicans surveyed, and did not fall below 76 percent among all political subgroups.25

Eight out of 10 Americans (81%) believe that corporations should only spend money on political campaigns if they disclose their spending immediately. This included 77 percent of Republicans and 91 percent of liberals surveyed.26 Eighty-six percent of Americans agree that prompt disclosure of political spending would help voters, customers, and shareholders hold companies accountable for political behavior. Support for that statement ranged from 83 percent to 92 percent across all political subgroups.27
In Citizens United, Justice Kennedy emphasized the importance of disclosure and accountability for corporate political spending. He wrote that disclosure requirements “provide[] shareholders and citizens with the information needed to hold corporations and elected officials accountable for their positions and supporters.”28 But those who seek to protect secret corporate political spending try to portray efforts to hold corporations accountable for their forays into elections as an attempt at harassment in order to evade disclosure. 
Courts throughout the country have rejected these excuses. Accountability is not harassment, and criticizing behavior is not chilling speech. Just the opposite - Justice Scalia has written that “[r]equiring people to stand up in public for their political acts fosters civic courage, without which democracy is doomed.”29
Voters have the right to know who is seeking to influence their vote and the decisions of their elected representatives. The public needs the information to be able to decide what weight to give the speech, and to be able to make connections should financial support engender access and influence leading to corrupt governance later. Indeed, in Citizens United the Justices held by a vote of 8 to 1 that mandatory disclosure is constitutionally sound because it “enables the electorate to make informed decisions and give proper weight to different speakers and messages.”30 Unfortunately, corporate funds are frequently funneled through third party groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which refuse to disclose the underlying donors who provide the financial resources for their political activities.
 
Americans are overwhelmingly in favor of specific steps to fix our broken system, all of which are achievable within current jurisprudential constraints:

Finally, the Corporate Reform Coalition poll shows that Americans are ready to act to prevent their voices from being drowned out by corporate political spending. Seventy nine percent would refuse to buy a company’s product or services to protest a company’s political spending. Seventy five percent would sign a petition to the SEC for corporate disclosure. Two out of three people (65%) would sell stock in the company, and over half (53%) would ask their employer to remove it from their retirement account. Just over half of respondents (52%) would go to a meeting of the company’s shareholders to ask for disclosure; 44 percent would be willing to go to protest. 
Americans understand that it is a corruption of the principle of a government “of the people, for the people, by the people” when moneyed interests are able to spend their way to greater access and influence with elected representatives, and when elected representatives are beholden to their financial supporters. Fidelity to the principle of political equality is the difference between a vital democracy and a stultifying plutocracy. Transparency and accountability reforms may temper some of the most corrosive and distorting effects of corporate wealth massing in our political system, but systemic changes are also necessary. The public is firmly and strongly in support of these measures. The time is now for fundamental reform of the role that money plays in our government, particularly when it comes in the form of corporate political spending.",policy-briefs
"After getting the First Amendment supremely wrong in Citizens United, the Supreme Court now faces its next money in politics case. In McCutcheon v. FEC, the challengers are attacking a law that says that no one person can contribute over $123,000 directly to federal candidates, parties, and committees—that’s over twice the average American’s income. The Supreme Court has previously upheld these contribution limits because they fight both the reality and the appearance that our democratic government is corrupted by the improper influence of big money on politics and policy. After all, in a democracy the size of your wallet should not determine the impact of your voice or your right to representation.
We don’t need the Court to do any more damage to our democracy. Shaped by the Court’s past decisions, the current system of campaign finance already allows a minute percentage of wealthy Americans, the donor class, to dominate our elections. If the Court strikes these limits, a single wealthy donor could contribute more than $3.5 million to one party’s candidates and committees. And, elected officials could solicit multi-million dollar checks from a single donor, providing greater incentive for candidates—and office holders—to grant these donors improper influence. 
A diverse array of groups representing almost 9.5 million Americans have come together on a brief authored by Demos to tell the Supreme Court—and our elected representatives—that Americans are outraged about the impact of money on the integrity and responsiveness of the United States government. These groups include the four principal conveners of the Democracy Initiative—Communication Workers of America, Greenpeace, the NAACP, and the Sierra Club—as well as the Main Street Alliance representing small business, Our Time and Rock the Vote representing young people, the American Federation of Teachers and Working Families Organization representing working families, and People for the American Way and U.S. PIRG representing the public interest. The following is a summary of the brief’s major points.
“Limitations on money in politics prevent the real or imagined coercive influence of large financial contributions on candidates’ positions and on their actions if elected to office.”—Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 26-27(1976) (per curiam).
“Take away Congress’ authority to regulate the appearance of undue influence and the cynical assumption that large donors call the tune could jeopardize the willingness of voters to take part in democratic government.""—McConnell v FEC, 251 F. Supp. 2d 176 (D.D.C.) aff’d in part, rev’d in part, 540 U.S. 93, 144 (2003). Internal citation omitted.
The Court has consistently cited the danger that interdependent relationships between elected officials and financial supporters pose to representative government. Legitimacy is essential for a functioning democracy, and it rests on the belief by the people that they are fairly represented. Americans know that financial supporters currently have an improper influence on our politics and policy, and they understand that this is corruption of democratic government.3 Elected representative have a duty to act with care and integrity in the interests of all their constituents, and the country as a whole, and not to favor the positions of their financial supporters. 

Even in Citizens United, Justice Kennedy recognized that: 
“[i]f elected officials succumb to improper influences . . .; if they surrender their best judgment; and if they put expediency before principle, then surely there is cause for concern.”
There is more than just cause for concern. American’s confidence in Congress is down to 10 percent—the lowest level of confidence for any institution on record since Gallup began asking this question in 1973.4 A majority of the American public, 52 percent, has little or no confidence in Congress. 

Since 1953, the National Election Survey has asked three questions pertaining to corruption in government from which they calculate the Trust in Government Index. The last index, in 2008, tied with the prior low in 1994; since then these responses have all worsened.5 Eighty-six percent of Americans are worried about corruption of government, and 82 percent of Americans are worried about special interests buying elections.6
Americans across the political spectrum believe that money in politics is the reason their representatives are more responsive to private interests with financial resources than to the public interest. Sixty percent of Americans say Members of Congress are more likely to vote in a way that pleases their financial supporters, while only twenty percent think Representatives will vote in the best interests of their constituents.7
Nearly three-quarters of voters—73 percent—thought that the influence of campaign money was a “major factor in causing the current financial crisis on Wall Street.“8 Responses between Republicans and Democrats were nearly identical, 74 percent and 76 percent respectively. They thought large campaign contributions from the banking industry led to lax government oversight of the industry. And, Americans recently reported feeling that the federal government “is so corrupted by big banks, big donors, and corporate lobbyists that it no longer works for the middle class.”9 Americans fear that this improper influence from private economic interests is preventing government from acting to address their real problems.
Almost eighty percent of Americans agree with the statement:
“I am worried that large political contributions will prevent Congress from tackling the important issues facing American today, like the economic crisis, rising energy costs, reforming health care, and global warming.”10
New research confirms F. Scott Fitzgerald’s observation that “the rich are different from you and me.” They have starkly different policy priorities than the general public, especially on economic issues. And government in the U.S. responds differentially—often dramatically so—to the preferences of the donor class, even when those preferences run counter to those of the general public. Campaign finance is a significant factor in this dynamic.
The differing preferences of the wealthy from the general public has been documented on many important policy issues—especially on key questions about how to structure the economy and respond to America’s economic needs. Recent research, including the 2011 study Democracy and the Policy Preferences of Wealthy Americans finds significant differences across a range of issues related to economic well-being and the role that government should play in the economy.11  For example, a full two-thirds (68 percent) of the general public believes that “the government in Washington ought to see to it that everyone who wants to work can find a job.” But among the wealthy respondents in the Policy Preferences study, only 19 percent agreed with that statement—a disparity of more than 3 to 1. Similarly, 78 percent of the public supports a minimum wage high enough that no family with a full time worker falls below the poverty line, while only 40 percent of the wealthy agree. That is a nearly 2 to 1 disparity.12

The general public is far more concerned with job creation and economic growth than with reducing the deficit, sometimes by double-digits.13 In contrast, for the high-wealth subjects of the Policy Preferences study asked to name the most important problem facing the country, “[o]ne-third (32 percent) of all open-ended responses mentioned budget deficits or excessive government spending, far more than mentioned any other issue.” Respondents were far more likely to favor cutting spending on programs such as Social Security, Food Stamps, and health care than was the general public, which instead would prefer to see expanded government spending on such programs.14

The differing policy preferences of the wealthy as compared to the general public would not present a challenge to the democratic vision of a representative government if the actual influence of the wealthy on public policy accorded with their numbers. But the degree to which a small cohort of Americans that contribute large sums to federal campaigns exerts a strong influence on the political process and public policy outcomes should be sobering to anyone concerned with the health of our democracy.
In the study Affluence and Influence, Professor Martin Gilens examined the extent to which the policy preferences of different income groups are reflected in actual policy outcomes in the United States, and found that average Americans have little influence when their preferences diverge from those of the affluent:
“The American government does respond to the public’s preferences, but that responsiveness is strongly tilted toward the most affluent citizens. Indeed, under most circumstances, the preferences of the vast majority of Americans appear to have essentially no impact on which policies the government does or
doesn’t adopt . . . The complete lack of government responsiveness to the preferences of the poor is disturbing and seems consistent only with the most cynical views of American politics . . . median-income Americans fare no better than the poor when their policy preferences diverge from those of the well-off.""
These findings challenge the vision of American democracy in which government of, by, and for the people responds to the will of the majority: when the preferences of the wealthiest ten percent conflicts with the rest of Americans, the views of ten percent trumps the ninety percent.15 This is supported by other research. The 2008 study, Unequal Democracy: The Political Economy of the New Gilded Age, found that “[t]he preferences of people in the bottom third of the income distribution have no apparent impact on the behavior of their elected officials.”16
Elected representatives are more dependent on a tiny fraction of the wealthy for financial support than ever before.
Already, American elections are dominated by a wealthy elite, with the improper influence and dependence that that entails. Candidates have relied on large donors for campaign funding before, but the dominance by a tiny fraction of the U.S. population over contributions and spending in support of candidates has escalated in recent years. Indeed, the Sunlight Foundation reported that in the 2012 elections “candidates got more money from a smaller percentage of the population that any year for which we have data.”17
Unsurprisingly, the affluent are far more likely to make financial contributions than are other Americans. Only .4 percent of the American population made a disclosed federal contribution of over $200 in 2012, whereas two in three (68 percent) wealthy respondents had made political contributions in the past year.18 Just 0.07 percent of the U.S. population made campaign donations of $2,500 or more in 2012.19
In the 2012 elections, over a quarter of all of the identifiable political contributions to any candidate, party, committee, or group came from just 31,385 people—one ten-thousandth of the United States population.20 The impact of this tiny group of Americans is clear: 86 percent of the members elected to Congress (372 of 435) and more than half of the members elected to the Senate in 2012 (20 out of 33) received more money from the 1 percent of the 1 percent than from all their small donors combined. According to the Sunlight Foundation “not a single member of the House or Senate was elected without financial assistance from this group.”21
Further, “[t]he nations’ biggest campaign donors have little in common with average Americans. They hail … from big cities, such as New York and Washington. They work for blue-chip corporations, such as Goldman Sachs and Microsoft. One in five works in the finance, insurance and real estate sector. One in ten works in law or lobbying.”22 The median aggregate contribution from this elite group was $26,584; this is more than half the median family income in the United States. Over 90 percent of donations come from majority white, wealthy neighborhoods while only four percent came from Latino neighborhoods, even though Latinos comprise 16 percent of the U.S. population. 2.7 percent came from majority African-American neighborhoods and less than one percent came from Asian neighborhoods.23

Because our elected officials depend upon this tiny fraction of the wealthy elite, they spend their time contacting the donor class and hearing about their concerns and priorities. In describing the four to six hours of fundraising calls he’s required to make per day, Senator Chris Murphy noted that he wasn’t calling anyone “who could not drop at least $1,000,” who he estimated make at least $500,000 to $1 million per year:
“[Those making between $500,000 to $1 million] have fundamentally different problems than other people. . . And so you’re hearing a lot about problems that bankers have and not a lot of problems that people who work at the mill . . .have. You certainly have to stop and check yourself.” 24
It is no wonder that Americans’ confidence that government is able to respond to important public needs by resisting the improper influence of campaign money is eroding. This phenomenon is driving a significant percentage of the public away from political engagement. Even in 2008, an election with record turnout, 80 million eligible persons failed to participate.25 In a poll of eligible persons who stated they were unlikely to vote, when asked why they did not pay attention to politics a majority (54 percent) said “[i]t is so corrupt.”26 As citizens lose faith in government, levers of democratic accountability are dismantled, and we lost the wisdom of the larger electorate in determining the direction of our nation.

Despite their concerns about the impact of campaign money on the integrity of their government, Americans have not given up on the belief that limiting the size of contributions is an important answer. Nearly three-quarters (73 percent) of all voters believe there should be common-sense limits on the amount of money people can contribute to political campaigns.27 A large majority of Americans, 60 percent, say “candidates ought to tackle money in politics in order to make government work for the middle class.”28
The Court should refuse to exacerbate fundraising dynamics that pressure elected representatives to favor the policy preferences of those they depend on for financial support. Elected officials are frequently raising money from the very interests they are charged with regulating—and which they must regulate effectively in the public interest. Those in positions of economic power can use their financial resources to support their favored politicians, and in turn elected officials can use their political power to further the economic interests of their financial supporters. This can lead to capture of government by private economic interests, in derogation of the duties of elected representatives to act in the interests of their constituents and the country as a whole. To prevent the crisis in confidence in American democratic government from worsening, the Court must uphold the contribution limits challenged in McCutcheon v FEC.",policy-briefs
"A new analysis of data through Election Day from the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and other sources by U.S. PIRG and Demos shows how big outside spenders drowned out small contributions in 2012: just 61 large donors to Super PACs giving an average of $4.7 million each matched the $285.2 million in grassroots contributions from more than 1,425,500 small donors to the major party presidential candidates.
In addition, the analysis found that just 132 donors giving at least $1 million were responsible for 60.4% of all the money Super PACs raised in the 2012 cycle.  $71.8 million of Super PAC money came from for-profit businesses.
This evidence shows that the first post-Citizens United election afforded corporations and large donors the opportunity to use their wealth to amplify their voices far beyond the volume of the average member of the general public - threatening the basic American principle of political equality - and they took full advantage.
Outside spending organizations reported $1.28 billion in spending to the FEC through the end of Election Day 2012. 

Almost half of all reported outside spending comes from Super PACs, the independent expenditure-only committees created in the wake of Citizens United.  Super PACs continue to receive the bulk of their funds from a small set of wealthy donors and corporations making very large contributions.

$396 million, or 60.4% of the $656 million raised by Super PACs, came from just 132 donors giving at least $1 million.

Fewer than 2,800 donors giving $10,000 or more were responsible for 98% of this fundraising.

Policy Recommendations:
The only way to stop the flow of unlimited money into our elections and the best way yo curb the influence of large donors is to overturn the “money equals speech” precedent in the 1976 Buckley v. Valeo decision, either by constitutional amendment or by Supreme Court revision.
The two major party presidential nominees have reported raising a combined total of $285.2 million from small donors giving less than $200 according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which came from at least 1,425,500 individuals. Just 61 donors (individuals and institutions) giving an average of $4.7 million each to Super PACs matched the total contributions of these small donors.

Because of their wealth and the Supreme Court’s equation of money with speech, those very large donors are able to amplify their voices to more than 23,000 times the volume of an average small donor.
Sheldon and Miriam Adelson, have given $52.2 million to Super PACs in the 2012 cycle, which, though a significant sum, is just 0.21% of their net worth.  It would take more than 322,000 average American families donating an equivalent share of their wealth ($162) to match the Adelsons’ giving alone.

Policy recommendations:
Short of the aforementioned constitutional amendment to allow for the democratic establishment of reasonable contribution and spending limits, there is much to be done to encourage the increased participation of small donors to balance out the big money.
A system of tax credits for small contributions to federal candidates was in place through the mid-eighties and should be restored. Vouchers for small contributions would also significantly increase donor participation among non-wealthy Americans. Matching small contributions with public funds would help candidates focus their campaign time on constituents, rather than big donors.
While it is likely that much of the business money coming into the elections was funneled through dark money sources such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which spent at least $36 million on races nationwide according to the Center for Responsive Politics, business corporations remain the second largest source of Super PAC money, accounting for $71.8 million, or 11% of all Super PAC funds.
Some of the largest and most active Super PACs receive a significant portion of their funding from businesses: pro-Romney Restore Our Future received 20% of its funds from for-profit corporations.

Polling released in late October revealed that 84 percent of Americans agree that corporate political spending drowns out the voices of average Americans, and 83 percent believe that corporations and corporate CEOs have too much political power and influence.
Policy Recommendations:
Corporations do not have the same rights as individual human beings and should not be allowed to spend money from their general treasuries in elections. Allowing a CEO or corporate board to direct funds aggregated from commercial enterprise to support or a candidate or cause fundamentally skews our democratic process and favors the profit imperative above all else. The only way to prevent this entirely is to overturn the Supreme Court’s decision in Citizens United, either by constitutional amendment or Court revision.
Until we reverse Citizens United, Congress should empower shareholders at corporations to have final say on whether the corporations they own may spend money in elections, thereby creating a minimum system of people-powered checks and balances on business money in politics.
Of the $1.28 billion in outside spending reported to the FEC, nearly one-quarter, or $298.9 million, was “dark money” that cannot be traced back to an original source.

 
Americans across the political spectrum have long held transparency in campaign funding to be crucial. When citizens can’t follow the money voters can’t judge the credibility of political communications and corporations and other special interests can fund misleading advertisements without facing accountability.
Policy Recommendations:
Congress and the states should enact laws that create transparency and allow Americans to trace every penny spent on elections back to an original source.
The Securities and Exchange Commission should issue a rule requiring publicly traded corporations to disclose their political spending to their shareholders, both direct spending and gifts to politically active trade associations such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, so that at the very least investors know when their money is being used to support causes they oppose.
Last month, new polling found that 76% of Americans support a requirement that companies publicly disclose their contributions to groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce that funnel their money into politics.
Because of gaps in reporting requirements, spending reported to the FEC is only part of the picture.  Groups are not required to report to any public agency certain spending that is intended to influence an election but falls outside of certain time windows before that election. 
However, there are a few races where complete spending information is available from private sources. These may give us a sense of the discrepancy between what was reported and what was actually spent by dark money groups. For example, when all types of outside spending on television ads related to the presidential race are taken into account, 37% of the spending has come from by “dark money” groups that do not disclose their donors.

Policy Recommendations:
 
To begin to understand the full scope of dark money in elections, Congress must expand the electioneering communications window, which presently only captures spending two months before generals and one month before primaries, to reflect the true length of modern elections.
It is clear that unlimited, corporate, and secret money continues to undermine the principle of ‘one person, one vote.’
Never before last Tuesday has big money had such a large profile in a national election, and the voters spoke clearly: we rejected the premise that elections are auctions and that democracy is for sale.
In the cities and states with direct referenda on money in politics, the electorate’s stance was clear: Coloradans rejected unlimited money in elections with 73% of the vote. Montana, which went overwhelmingly red in the presidential election, passed a resolution shooting down the dual notions that money is speech and corporations are people by a margin of 50 points (75%-25%), proving that this issue bridges partisan divides. Voters in towns all over Massachusetts and in Chicago and San Francisco also passed ballot initiatives pushing back on the avalanche of big, special interest money.
Polling over the last few months confirms the premise that Americans’ awareness of the problems associated with corporate and unlimited money in our politics has reached new heights: seven out 10 Americans believe that Super PACs should be illegal and nine out of 10 believe that corporations have too much power in our political process.
Furthermore, many of the winning campaigns facing massive Super PAC and dark money opposition made big money in politics an issue, which turned the tables and transformed big spending into a double-edged sword.
All this could not have been accomplished without heavy media attention on the issue of big money. Unfortunately, some in the media have now begun to embrace the notion that the big money didn’t matter, looking for the simplest story of a correlation between cash and victory, which fundamentally misses the point.
This narrative on campaign finance is misguided.  Allowing the wealthy few to amplify their voices in the public square threatens the basic American value of political equality for several reasons:
First, a tiny number of wealthy individuals and interests continue to set the agenda in Washington and in state capitals across America.  Second, down-ticket races are easier to buy than high-profile presidential and senate contests where there is plenty of media coverage and general awareness of candidates and their positions.  Third, large donors and big spenders enjoy preferred access to and influence over winning candidates—giving them another, direct chance to shape the agenda in Washington and state capitals across America, and undermining citizens’ confidence in our democracy.  Fourth, the threat of massive outside spending is ever-present, shaping candidate behavior and forcing them to spend time on a high-stakes arms race rather than engaging voters or actually governing (in the case of incumbents). 
The narrative also puts America in a Catch-22: according to some, if money in politics is really a problem, then the candidates with the most financial backing will always win. But in that scenario, those who rode into office on a wave of money will never vote for reforming the system that elected them. On the other hand, if there is not an unquestionable correlation between victory and outside spending, then maybe we’ll have elected legislators willing to tackle reform, but some will argue there is no problem with unlimited money in the first place.
We see it differently: rather than seeing Tuesday’s results as an indicator that big money in politics is not a problem, our freshly elected legislators, in particular those who fought back against special interest outside spending should see the results as a mandate for reform.
We hope the figures and policy recommendations in this analysis can provide a roadmap for the changes needed to build a campaign finance system grounded in democratic principles.
This is the fourth release in the PIRG and Demos series of analyses on the role of money in the 2012 elections.  Previous reports are available here, here, and here. Today’s release shows the overwhelming influence of a tiny number of wealthy donors.  The organizations plan to release a comprehensive analysis of 2012 election fundraising and spending in January 2013.",policy-briefs
"The Supreme Court’s decision in Citizens United v. FEC allowed corporations to spend unlimited amounts of money to influence American politics. But, the American public is kept from understanding the full impact of new corporate money in politics because of the explosion of secret political spending and the failure to adopt common sense disclosure requirements.
Since Citizens United, more than $600 million in dark money has been spent in U.S. elections through 501(c)(4) and (c)(6) organizations that do not have to disclose their funders. Secret corporate political spending threatens the integrity of our democratic self-government, as those with the deepest pockets can overwhelm other voices. This financial influence leads to the needs and wants of corporations being prioritized and can skew important public policy outcomes, often in ways that perpetuate racial inequities. But while politicians typically know who is spending money to support their political fortunes, the public is denied the ability to properly assess when “elected officials are ‘in the pocket’ of … moneyed interests.”1
Many have called for measures that would pull back the curtain on corporate political spending. Greater transparency of such spending is particularly needed with respect to government contractors, who are given taxpayer dollars to do the people’s business.2 These contractors often turn around and engage in political spending to influence policies that preserve their profits at the public’s expense, or affect contracting decisions. Government contractors often heavily advocate for, and profit when the federal government adopts, policies that disproportionately harm people of color and other traditionally disenfranchised populations. An executive order requiring government contractors to disclose their political spending would help the public hold government contractors accountable for political spending that benefits their bottom lines while entrenching structural racism in our country.
 
The federal government expends much of the public purse through contractors that provide goods and services. Currently, there are a number of companies that profit from government contracts and then spend money in politics to influence politicians to support policies they view as benefitting their bottom line. Often these policies have a disproportionately negative effect on people of color and fail to reflect the priorities of the American public. It is, therefore, unsurprising that many companies and 501(c)(4) and (c)(6) organizations are actively advocating to preserve their right to flood the political sphere with dark money, thereby avoiding public accountability.3 
Requiring government contractors to disclose the money they spend in politics through all channels will allow the public to better assess what corporations are getting for their political investments. Even when only partially accounted for, since they fail to capture sums spent through secret channels, the numbers are staggering. According to the Sunlight Foundation: 
Between 2007 and 2012, 200 of America’s most politically active corporations spent a combined $5.8 billion on federal lobbying and campaign contributions. [But] what they gave pales compared to what those same corporations got: $4.4 trillion in federal business and support.4
That amount is “more than the $4.3 trillion the federal government paid the nation’s 50 million Social Security recipients over the same period.”5
A closer look at the top 20 publicly traded federal contractors in 2013 and 2014—17 of which remained the same in both years6—gives a further glimpse into the extent of the dark money problem among federal contractors. In 2013 and 2014, these government contractors were among the top corporate political spenders.7 During the last election cycle, the PACs and employees of these companies contributed over $50 million to candidates8 and received over $261 billion in federal contracts.9

However, these numbers only reflect part of the story. Of the aforementioned publicly traded federal contractors, 80 percent do not disclose the amounts that they contributed to 501(c)(4) and 501(c)(6) organizations.10 This is deeply troubling given that the number of groups filtering dark money into our political system has increased exponentially in recent years11—so much so that the 2014 mid-term was dubbed, by some, as the “dark money election.”12 And since secret political spending has been growing exponentially in each election since Citizens United, we can expect 2016 to be even worse. 
 
The interests of government contractors are often not in alignment with those of the general public and, in particular, people of color. Such contractors have helped reinforce systems of structural racism that exist in the U.S. Two recent examples of such efforts can be seen in the ways that government contractors have: (a) actively worked to defeat efforts to increase the minimum wage, and (b) sought to strengthen an already racially biased and flawed system of incarceration. 
The government contracting process also contributes to racial inequity in other ways. First, spending by government contractors and other members of the donor class operates to maintain an unrepresentative government. And, second, there have been numerous instances where government contracts have been awarded to those with political connections and resulted in the waste of public dollars, which could have been allocated to programs that help promote racial equity and dismantle systems of structural racism.
 
Government contractors actively oppose efforts to raise the minimum wage, a policy that would help lift people out of poverty and improve racial equity in our nation. As a recent Dēmos report explained, government contractors often benefit from paying many of their workers low wages while providing exorbitant compensation for company executives:
Through federal contracts and other funding, our tax dollars are fueling the low-wage economy and exacerbating inequality. Hundreds of billions of dollars in federal contracts, grants, loans, concession agreements, and property leases go to private companies that pay low wages, provide few benefits, and offer employees little opportunity to work their way into the middle class.13
An increase in the minimum wage would raise millions of Americans out of poverty.14 Since 2009, the federal minimum wage has stood at only $7.25 per hour.15 At this rate, a full-time worker earns only $15,080 each year—which falls below the federal poverty guidelines for households of two or more.16 Individuals living at such a low-income level will not be able to help generate growth in the American economy. Rather, they have to rely on food stamps and other public assistance benefits just to make it from one paycheck to the next. 
Furthermore, increasing the minimum wage is an important tool in efforts to improve racial equity in our nation. This is clear when one looks at the demographic makeup of our nation’s low-wage workforce: while people of color make up only 32 percent of the American workforce, they comprise approximately 42 percent of the minimum wage workforce.17 
However, while the American public strongly favors raising the minimum wage18—and while such a reform would improve the lives of hard-working Americans, advance racial justice, and increase the amount of money being spent in the economy—legislation aimed at increasing the federal minimum wage has been defeated numerous times over the years.19
Members of the legislature opposing a minimum wage increase frequently argue that raising it would harm businesses.20 These arguments often closely parallel those that have been made by government contractors, who are members of 501(c)(4) and (c)(6) organizations—like the International Franchise Association (“IFA”) and the “Jeffersonian Project,” the 501(c)(4) arm of the American Legislative Exchange Council (“ALEC”)—that actively oppose raising the minimum wage.21 
Dark money groups and their affiliates have issued publications arguing against a minimum wage increase,22 lobbied against increasing the minimum wage,23 and drafted language that prevents any political subdivision within a state from raising the minimum wage above what is required by the state,24 which has been introduced in at least 12 state legislatures.25 In addition, IFA is actively challenging the ordinance enacted by the City of Seattle, which increases the minimum wage to $15, in court.26 
Despite the fact that the American public largely supports proposals to increase the minimum wage, government contractors have consistently campaigned against efforts to establish a living wage. The current minimum wage allows contractors to increase their profits at the expense of their employees and benefit from a low-wage workforce which, in the United States, is comprised of a disproportionately high percentage of people of color. The public has a right to know how contractors are spending the tax dollars of hard-working Americans to advocate against the interests of hard-working Americans. 
 
It is no secret that the U.S. criminal justice system is racially biased. Our society is one that: incarcerates Blacks at nearly six times the rates of whites; sentences Blacks for drug offenses at nearly 10 times the rate of whites, despite the fact that whites use drugs at five times the rate as Blacks; imposes sentences on Black males that are approximately 20 percent longer than whites convicted of similar crimes; and disproportionately assigns the death penalty to people of color.27
The private prison industry thrives on maintaining a system that incarcerates high numbers of people and keeps them in jail for longer terms. And, in recent years, there has been a boom in the growth of the federal private prison population that has vastly outpaced the growth in the incarceration rate. According to data recently released by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, between 2000 and 2012, the number of individuals held in private federal prisons increased by 10.1 percent on average each year; however state private prisons only saw an annual increase of 2 percent.28 In addition, as of 2012, approximately half of all individuals housed at immigrant detention facilities were at privately operated facilities, as compared to approximately one-fourth a decade prior.29
Three of the largest for-profit private prisons in the U.S. are the Corrections Corporation of America (“CCA”), The GEO Group, Inc. (“GEO”), and Management and Training Corporation (“MTC”). According to the Center for Responsive Politics, in the 2014 election cycle, these groups spent $3.698 million on lobbying federal officials and the PACs and employees of these companies contributed $552,636 to federal campaigns.30 But this may only be a fraction of what these companies have filtered into the federal political system because it includes only those contributions that have been disclosed. There is no way of knowing how much money these companies have funneled into the political process through 501(c)(4) and (c)(6) organizations.
The payout for CCA, GEO, and MTC’s efforts: in 2013 and 2014, these companies received over $1.561 billion in contracts from the federal government.31
These for-profit private prison companies have openly described how they benefit from policies that result in higher rates of incarceration. As CCA noted in its 2014 Annual Report: 
The demand for our facilities and services could be adversely affected by the relaxation of enforcement efforts, leniency in conviction or parole standards and sentencing practices or through the decriminalization of certain activities that are currently proscribed by criminal laws. For instance, any changes with respect to drugs and controlled substances or illegal immigration could affect the number of persons arrested, convicted, and sentenced, thereby potentially reducing demand for correctional facilities to house them…. Legislation has also been proposed in numerous jurisdictions that could lower minimum sentences for some non-violent crimes[.]32
It is, therefore, no surprise that CCA, GEO and others support policies (like three-strikes and truth-in-sentencing laws) that dole out harsher punishments, result in lengthier sentences, and increase rates of incarceration among the general American public and the immigrant population.33 In addition, these groups have actively opposed legislation that would subject the private prison industry to the same federal public records laws as government-run prisons.34
CCA, GEO, and MTC are also all members of ALEC,35 which, as noted above, recently opened a 501(c)(4) arm that has been dubbed the “Jeffersonian Project.”36 ALEC has frequently supported policies that disproportionately harm individuals of color, including policies that have resulted in the explosion of the prison population over the last few decades.37 By donating to the “Jeffersonian Project” or one of the many other 501(c)(4) or (c)(6) organizations that exist, groups like CCA, GEO, and MTC are able to influence politicians outside the public’s line of sight. 
When legislators benefit from secret corporate political spending by private prison companies, and then support policies that advance the prison-industrial complex and increase the profits for these private prison companies, they are helping to maintain a system of criminal injustice that will imprison approximately 1 in 3 Black males over the course of their lifetimes.38 The current system disproportionately punishes people of color and creates “devastating economic consequences” for communities whose populations are incarcerated at inflated rates.39
 
People of color are underrepresented in elected office. In total, of the 535 members of Congress, there are only 96 people of color (nearly 18%),40 meaning that over 82% of Congress is white, non-Hispanic. And, of these elected officials, only 46 (approximately 8.6%) are Black.41 However, the 2014 population estimates produced by the U.S. Census Bureau show that these numbers do not reflect the demographic makeup of our nation. The Census Bureau estimates that, in 2014, only 62.2% of the U.S. population was white, non-Hispanic and 14.3% of the population identified as Black.42
The role of money in politics is one large factor contributing to the underrepresentation of people of color in Congress and elected office more generally. For instance, candidates of color often lack “access to networks of wealthy donors”43 and tend to raise significantly less than their white counterparts.44 
Government contractors and other companies have contributed to this problem in several ways. First, whites dominate the boards of large companies,45 which makes it unlikely that corporate spending will be appropriately “responsive to the needs of people of color.”46 Indeed, as demonstrated by the case studies above, the money that government contractors and other large companies tend to spend on politics is adverse to the interests and needs of people of color and other disenfranchised groups. This is deeply troubling when one considers the fact that, “[o]n issue after issue—from the minimum wage, to paid sick leave, to the regulation of predatory lenders—it is the donor class whose views and priorities win out in the end.”47
Second, companies contribute more to efforts to elect white candidates.48 This helps sustain an unrepresentative democracy that is unresponsive to the needs of people of color. Studies have shown that white legislators from both sides of the aisle respond less frequently to the needs and concerns raised by people of color, while legislators of color will respond more frequently to their constituents of color and are more likely to advocate for issues and support policies that are of importance to people of color.49
 
Secret political spending fosters a pay-to-play culture that benefits the politically well connected. The federal government hands out hundreds of billions of dollars of contracts each year without undertaking a meaningful bidding process.50 These contracts have reportedly favored large contributors “over small competitors, reward[ed] political connections rather than management skill,” and resulted in numerous instances of fraud, mismanagement, and waste.51 The current system, which results in the inefficient allocation of taxpayer dollars, can have an enormous impact on the lives of the American public. 
When federal dollars go to waste, the American public suffers. Requiring contractor disclosure could help combat pay-to-play corruption and encourage a competitive bidding process that will save taxpayer dollars and allow them to be reallocated to our nation’s education system52 and other programs that help reduce the racial wealth gap and foster racial equity.
 
When the U.S. Supreme Court decided Citizens United in 2010, it held that the First Amendment grants corporations the right to spend an unlimited amount of funds on politics.53 At the same time, the Court upheld requirements that the true source of political spending be disclosed, recognizing that “transparency enables the electorate to make informed decisions,” “see whether elected officials are ‘in the pocket’ of … moneyed interests,” and “give proper weight to different speakers and messages.”54
The Court envisioned a “prompt” disclosure regime facilitated by the Internet, which would allow shareholders and citizens “to hold corporations and elected officials accountable.”55 But this modern disclosure system does not yet exist. Instead, corporations have funneled contributions through 501(c)(4) and (c)(6) organizations that do not have to disclose their funders. This allows corporations to keep their political spending in the dark. 
President Obama can act to improve the problem of dark money in politics dramatically by issuing an Executive Order to require federal contractors to fully disclose the money they spend in politics. This Order would be an important first step in bringing corporate political spending out of the dark and into the light, to illuminate what candidates are in the pockets of big businesses with interests that diverge from those of the American public and, in particular, people of color. ",policy-briefs
"A new analysis of pre-election data from the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and other sources by U.S. PIRG and Demos shows that outside spending in the first presidential election since Citizens United is living up to its hype: new waves of “outside spending” have been fueled by dark money and unlimited fundraising from a small number of wealthy donors.
“While the results of next week’s contests are up in the air, one thing is clear: big donors and secret spenders have been drowning out the rest of our voices for months,” said U.S. PIRG Democracy Advocate Blair Bowie.
Outside spending organizations reported $1.11 billion in spending to the FEC through the final reporting deadline in the 2012 cycle. That’s already a 200% increase over total 2008 outside spending.

Almost half of all reported outside spending comes from Super PACs, the independent expenditure-only committees created in the wake of Citizens United, and Super PACs continue to receive the bulk of their funds from a small set of wealthy donors making very large contibutions.

$266.6 million or 60.5% of the $440.9 million raised by Super PACs from individuals came from just 91 people giving at least $1 million.  Just over 1900 donors giving $10,000 or more were responsible for 97% of this fundraising.

“On Election Day, we’re all supposed to have an equal say,” said Adam Lioz, Counsel for Demos.  “But, next week a small group of millionaires and billionaires will have more influence than millions of middle class families.”
“Because of their wealth and the Supreme Court’s equation of money with speech, those megadonors are able to amplify their voices to more than 3100 times the volume of an average small donor,” said Bowie.

Sheldon and Miriam Adelson, have given $52.2 million to Super PACs in the 2012 cycle, which, though a significant sum, is just .21% of their net worth.  It would take more than 322,000 average American families donating an equivalent share of their wealth ($162) to match just the Adelsons’ giving. 

While it is likely that much of the business money coming into the elections is funneled through dark money sources such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which so far has spent at least $35 million on races nationwide, the analysis found that business corporations remain the second largest source of Super PAC money, accounting for 12% of all Super PAC funds.
Some of the largest and most active Super PACs receive a significant portion of their funding from businesses: pro-Romney Restore Our Future received over 20% of its funds from for-profit corporations.

Polling last week found that 84 percent of Americans agree that corporate political spending drowns out the voices of average Americans, and 83 percent believe that corporations and corporate CEOs have too much political power and influence.
Of the $1.11 billion in outside spending reported to the FEC, nearly one-quarter, or $257.9 million, was “dark money” that cannot be traced back to an original source. 

Because of gaps in reporting requirements, spending reported to the FEC is only part of the picture.  Groups are not required to report to any public agency certain spending that is intended to influence an election but falls outside of certain time windows before that election.  When all types of outside spending on television ads related to the presidential race are taken into account, 32% the spending has come from by “dark money” groups that do not disclose their donors.

 “Americans across the political spectrum have long held transparency in campaign funding to be crucial,” said Bowie. “When citizens can’t follow the money voters can’t judge the credibility of political communications and corporations and other special interests can fund misleading advertisements without facing accountability.”
Last week, new polling found that 76% of Americans support a requirement that companies publicly disclose their contributions to groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce that funnel their money into politics. 
U.S. PIRG and Demos are encouraging every eligible American to go to the polls by November 6th to push back on the power of big money. 
“Unlimited, corporate, and secret money continues to undermine the principle of ‘one person, one vote,’” Lioz said.  “It’s more important than ever that Americans use the power of their votes to push back and make their voices heard.”
This is the third release in the PIRG and Demos series of analyses on the role of money in the 2012 elections. Previous reports are available here and here. Today’s release shows a sharp increase in the amount of secret spending reported to the FEC, as we would expect given the proximity to the election.  The organizations plan to release a short post-election update on November 9 and a comprehensive analysis of election fundraising and spending in January 2013. ",policy-briefs
"The fast food industry is the main driver of compensation inequality in the most disparate sector of the economy, with a CEO-to-worker pay ratio in 2013 of over 1000-to-1.
Good afternoon. My name is Catherine Ruetschlin and I am a Senior Policy Analyst at Demos, a public policy organization working to ensure that all Americans have an equal say in our democracy and an equal chance in our economy. I’m here today to add our voice to the growing calls for a higher wage standard in New York for workers in the fast food industry and beyond. 
Last year Demos released the report Fast Food Failure: How CEO-to-Worker Pay Disparity Undermines the Industry and the Overall Economy, showing that the fast food industry is the main driver of compensation inequality in the most disparate sector of the economy, with a CEO-to-worker pay ratio in 2013 of over 1000-to-1. The pay disparity in the fast food industry is an extreme outlier, even in an economy where inequality overall has become an increasing point of concern. The outsized ratio is largely driven by the poverty-level wages paid to the industry’s front-line workforce. It is also a prime example of the trend since the Great Recession that shows earners at the very top of the income distribution capturing all of the gains of economic growth and leaving the rest of the population behind.
While the most immediate repercussions of fast food’s compensation practices are felt by workers in its low-wage jobs, our paper demonstrates that the companies’ lopsided human capital allocation creates new risks to investors through increased operational issues, labor unrest, and legal costs. Moreover, the negative consequences of extreme pay disparity are not isolated to the industry where they are produced. Many of the low-wage jobs that compose fast food employment are among the occupational categories projected to add the most jobs over the coming decade. Our economy is increasingly reliant on employment in the most unequal industries; making it harder for working people to share in the gains of economic growth and concentrating more and more income at the top. According to a broadening consensus of economists like those at the International Monetary Fund and the World Economic Forum, this increasing income disparity across the economy reinforces the problems of instability and slow growth. 
In New York’s fast food industry, where the median wage is $9.03 per hour, 62 percent of employees work at franchise locations like those of the large firms in our study. These companies take advantage of disproportionate power over the price of labor by holding their workers at or below the poverty line while reaping billions in profits each year. But research shows that even smaller companies could raise wages as high as $15 per hour while maintaining current levels of employment and rates of profit. Economists Robert Pollin and Jeannette Wicks-Lim at the University of Massachusetts Amherst’s Political Economy Research Institute demonstrate in a recent paper how companies can offset the increased costs of phasing in a new minimum wage. The authors estimate that productivity gains from reductions in turnover, training costs, and absenteeism will offset at least 17 percent of the total cost of the raise, based on industry-level estimates and the prevailing economics research on employer separation costs and elasticities. In addition, trend sales growth since the late 1990s shows that fast food sales grow on pace with the overall economy. While projected sales may be affected by the consumer response to price increases, Pollin and Wicks-Lim illustrate that employers can benefit from modest price increases that cover the remaining portion of the wage bill while accounting for the price elasticity of demand. With a combination of modest price increases, productivity increases, and the gains from growth, employers can choose to pay their workforce higher wages without negative employment effects, all while maintaining industry profitability.  
In closing, I would like to attest to the potential for the fast food industry to be a leader advancing real opportunity for today’s workers. More than a decade ago, before I was a policy analyst or an economist, I was a fast food employee. It was one of the three jobs I held at the time, affording a simple budget with enough left over to save up to go to college after a couple of years. I put in hard hours for my employer and it eventually worked out just fine for me. My experience, however, is unrecognizable to those workers toiling in the low-wage economy today. Compared to the year when I earned my last fast food paycheck, the cost of living is higher and CEO and company earnings at large fast food chains have flourished, but wages have barely budged. At the same time, new complications like unstable, unpredictable, and on call scheduling have emerged to increase the barriers to workers trying to make their way in the industry. Low wages coupled with insufficient hours and unstable scheduling impose new costs on workers and are antithetical to the idea of work as an opportunity to make a productive contribution and to build a better life. We know that our economy can do better, and must. A raise for New York’s fast food workforce is an important step toward building an economy that rewards all of its members adequately for their contributions, and that makes work a path to financial security for all. ",testimony-and-public-comment
"Testimony before the Boston City Council on Campaign Finance Reform
Because this hearing reflects an initial look at ideas for campaign finance reform, it seems appropriate to start with some foundational principles that may help provide a framework for discussion. Much discussion about campaign finance reform proposals around the country is devoted to examining how a particular reform will affect the fortunes of a particular political party; how it might affect candidates; how it will affect donors. I would like to suggest a different framework for analyzing proposed reforms that developed out of my experience with the National Voting Rights Institute and the work we did around the country to help promote the understanding of campaign finance reform as a basic voting rights and civil rights issue. A standard that NVRI and many other groups and advocates decided to incorporate into their work became known as the “Fannie Lou Hamer” standard.
The Fannie Lou Hamer standard recalls the Mississippi civil rights leader who challenged the nation to get serious about fighting segregation and the exclusion of people of color from the political process. Under the standard, you determine if a reform is real by asking “Does this reform make the process fairer for someone like Fannie Lou Hamer” – a passionate leader, a person of color but without access to wealth, without high-level connections, whose influence depends on the strength of her ideas and the rightness of her cause. Asking how a proposed reform measures up against that standard puts the right framework in place, because it brings the discussion back to how a reform advances the responsiveness of government to the citizens it serves, a core goal of democracy.

"Virginia’s investment in higher education has decreased considerably over the past two decades.
In today’s economy, a college education is essential for getting a good job and entering the middle class. Yet, despite this reality, college costs are rising beyond the reach of many Virginians. State policy decisions have played a significant role in this rise by shifting costs onto students and families though declining state support. Virginia’s investment in higher education has decreased considerably over the past two decades, and its financial aid programs, though still some of the country’s most expansive, fail to reach many students with financial need. Students and their families now pay—or borrow—much more than they can afford to get a higher education, a trend which will have grave consequences for Virginia’s future economy. 
This brief is based on the Demos report “The Great Cost Shift,” which examines how nationwide disinvestment in public higher education over the past two decades has shifted costs to students and their families. The report outlines how such disinvestment is magnified by rapidly rising enrollments, and its effects are felt particularly acutely as student bodies become more economically, racially, and ethnically diverse. This fact sheet focuses on Virginia, highlighting the trends in the state’s higher education funding over the last twenty years. 
Virginia’s overall funding for higher education has declined precipitously since its pre-Great Recession peak in 2007.1 Funding per student in the state, consistently below the national average, has fallen even more dramatically, since enrollments have risen significantly even as total funding fell. Though state funding for higher education has historically risen and fallen in tune with the business cycle, the post-Great Recession decline appears to be a worrisome departure from the historical pattern. 

Virginia’s declining state financial support for its public colleges and universities has translated into higher tuition and fees, making college increasingly unaffordable for the state’s students. 

Despite the decline in overall higher education appropriations, funding for Virginia’s main grant financial aid program, the Virginia Commonwealth Award program has risen substantially since the Great Recession. The average grant awarded also rose slightly, helping to offset the rise in tuition costs for the approximately 16 percent of Virginia students who receive the grants. 

Tuitions have been rising far more rapidly than family incomes, causing the tuition costs to take an increasingly large bite out of family budgets. The increasing unaffordability of a college education in the state combined with the decreasing share of tuition covered by Commonwealth grants have forced Virginia’s students to borrow more to pay for school. 

Despite the increasing cost of a higher education, enrollments at Virginia’s colleges and universities have risen steadily over the past two decades, in part due to the high share of Virginia’s high school graduates that enroll in college. Graduation rates at the state’s four-year schools, too, continue to outpace those of the country as a whole. However, one blot on Virginia’s higher education outcomes is its graduation rate from two-year institutions, which is below the national average. 

Even though Virginia’s graduation rate from four-year schools is higher than the national average, it is still too low to meet the future demands of the state’s labor market, which will increasingly require a postsecondary credential. Sixty-four percent of all jobs in the Old Dominion are projected to require some sort of postsecondary education by 2018,7 yet just 47 percent of young Virginians (ages 25-34) currently have an associate’s degree or higher.8 This share is not projected to improve much in the near future: by 2018, just 48 percent of all Virginians are projected to hold a two-year degree or higher, leaving the state with a significant educational gap in its labor market.9 Fortunately, Virginia can still close this projected gap by taking advantage of the state’s resources to invest in the current and future generations of Virginians aspiring to realize the American Dream through postsecondary education. 
With the recent cuts in higher education funding, Virginia is endangering the quality of its institutions of higher learning, threatening the state’s economic competitiveness and the future of its young people. To reverse course, the state will need to commit to bold solutions that can strengthen and stabilize funding for Virginia’s state universities and colleges, and provide greater financial support to deserving students.",research
"Connecticut’s investment in higher education has decreased considerably over the past two decades.
In today’s economy, a college education is essential for getting a good job and entering the middle class. Yet, despite this reality, college costs are rising beyond the reach of many Connecticutters. State policy decisions have played a significant role in this rise by shifting costs onto students and families through declining state support. Connecticut’s investment in higher education has decreased considerably over the past two decades, and its financial aid programs, though still some of the country’s most expansive, fail to reach many students with financial need.

Connecticut’s declining state financial support for its public colleges and universities has translated into higher tuition and fees, making college increasingly unaffordable for the state’s students.

Exacerbating the decline in overall higher education appropriations, funding for Connecticut’s main grant financial aid programs have plummeted since the Great Recession. The average grant has fallen even more precipitously, decreasing its buying power for the 59% of Connecticut students who receive the grants.

Tuitions have been rising far more rapidly than family incomes, causing the tuition costs to take an increasingly large bite out of family budgets. The increasing unaffordability of a college education in the state combined with the decreasing share of tuition covered by Commonwealth grants have forced Connecticut’s students to borrow more to pay for school.


Despite the increasing cost of a higher education, enrollments at Connecticut’s colleges and universities have risen steadily over the past two decades, in part due to the high share of Connecticut’s high school graduates that enroll in college. Graduation rates at the state’s 4-year schools, too, continue to outpace those of the country as a whole. However, one blot on Connecticut’s higher education outcomes is its graduation rate from 2-year institutions, which is well below the national average.

Even though Connecticut’s graduation rates from its 4-year public colleges and universities are well above the national average, they are still too low to meet the future demands of the state’s labor market, which will increasingly require a postsecondary credential. Sixty-five percent of all jobs in the Constitution State are projected to require some sort of postsecondary education by 2018,7 yet just 47 percent of young Connecticutters (ages 25-34) currently have an associate’s degree or higher.8 This share is not projected to improve much in the near future: by 2018, just 49 percent of all working-age Connecticutters are projected to hold a two-year degree or higher, leaving the state with a significant educational gap in its labor market.9 Fortunately, Connecticut can still close this projected gap by taking advantage of our state’s resources to invest in the current and future generations of Connecticutters aspiring to realize the American Dream through postsecondary education. 
With recent cuts in state need-based aid, and the ensuing rise in costs for low-income students, Connecticut is endangering the mission of upward mobility inherent in the public higher education system. By increasing need-based aid, Connecticut would be able to offer the promise of affordable higher education to the very groups that are underrepresented in our higher education system—groups that stand to benefit the most from higher education. Even beyond these students, Connecticut is endangering the quality of its institutions of higher learning by spending less per student than a generation ago, threatening the state’s economic competitiveness and the future of its young people. To reverse course, the state will need to commit to bold solutions that can strengthen and stabilize funding for Connecticut’s state universities and colleges, and provide greater financial support to deserving students.",research
"State Higher Education Funding After the Recession
As student debt continues to climb, it’s important to understand how our once debt-free system of public universities and colleges has been transformed into a system in which most students borrow, and at increasingly higher amounts. In less than a generation, our nation’s higher education system has become a debt-for-diploma system—more than seven out of 10 college seniors now borrow to pay for college and graduate with an average debt of $29,400.1 Up until about two decades ago, state funding ensured college tuition remained within reach for most middle-class families, and financial aid provided extra support to ensure lower-income students could afford the costs of college. 
As Demos chronicled in its first report in The Great Cost Shift series, this compact began to unravel as states disinvested in higher education during economic downturns but were unable, or unwilling, to restore funding levels during times of economic expansion. Today, as a result, public colleges and universities rely on tuition to fund an ever-increasing share of their operating expenses. And students and their families rely more and more on debt to meet those rising tuition costs. Nationally, revenue from tuition paid for 44 percent of all operating expenses of public colleges and universities in 2012, the highest share ever. A quarter century ago, the share was just 20 percent.2 This shift—from a collective funding of higher education to one borne increasingly by individuals—has come at the very same time that low- and middle-income households experienced stagnant or declining household income. 
The Great Recession intensified these trends, leading to unprecedented declines in state funding for higher education and steep tuition increases:
NATIONWIDE CUTS: 49 states (all but North Dakota) are spending less per student on higher education than they did before the Great Recession.3 In contrast, only 33 states cut per-student spending between 2001 and 2008,4 the period since the last recession. 
MANY DEEP CUTS: In many states, the cuts have been especially deep. Since the recession, 28 states have cut per-student funding by more than 25 percent, compared to just one state—Michigan—that did so between 2001 and 2008. 
ESCALATING TUITION: Funding cuts have led to large tuition increases. Nationally, average tuition at 4-year public universities increased by 20 percent in the four years since 2008 after rising 14 percent in the four years prior. In seven states, average tuition increased by more than a third, and two states—Arizona and California—have raised it by more than two-thirds, or 66 percent. At public 2-year colleges, average tuition has risen by more than a third in six states.
FAMILIES PRICED OUT: Average tuition at 4-year public schools now consumes more than 15 percent of the median household income in 26 states. Average total cost—including room and board—consumes more than one-third of the median household income in 22 states.
The decreasing affordability of higher education is eroding the last relatively secure path into the middle class, as more students take on larger amounts of debt to finance their higher educations, or forego it altogether. With $1.2 trillion in outstanding student loan debt and climbing, student loan debt is now substantial enough to affect our overall economy as indebted graduates find it harder to buy a home or a car.4
This brief updates our previous analysis of state funding trends by examining trends in state funding and tuition since the Great Recession. 
Every state but one—North Dakota—has cut per-student funding since the Great Recession in order to help close wide budget gaps. Nationwide, these cuts have averaged $2,394 per student, or 27 percent. As Figure 1 and Figure 2 show, the magnitude of the cuts varies widely from state to state.6 However, most states have made deep cuts to higher education funding: 29 states have cut funding by more than $2,000 per student, resulting in a national average cut in funding of more than 25 percent. 


Higher education cuts triggered by the Great Recession were closely linked to state budget gaps. As Figure 3 shows, Arizona, California, and Nevada had the three largest deficits, and also made some of the largest higher education cuts, as well. The budget gaps, in turn, were significantly linked to the housing crisis. Declines in housing prices were the most severe in Arizona, California, Nevada, and Florida. All of the hardest-hit states raised taxes after the Great Recession,7 but none raised them enough to close their entire gap, making higher education cuts all but inevitable. 

Historically, public colleges and universities get nearly all of their revenue from state and local funding and tuition and fees. So, when states cut higher education funding, schools essentially have two options for closing the gap: raise student charges—tuition, fees, room, and board—or cut salaries and services. Most states have chosen to do both since the Great Recession, implementing steep hikes in charges for tuition, room, and board, and cutting thousands of course offerings and positions. 
The effect of state cuts on student charges has been especially dramatic. Nationwide, tuition at public 4-year universities has risen by an average of 20 percent, or $1,282, since 2008. The increase in total cost—including room and board—has been even greater, rising by an average of $2,292 over the same period. Tuition at public 2-year schools has increased sharply as well, rising by an average of 18.5 percent, or $414, since 2008. 

In many states, the tuition increases have far outstripped the national average. Seventeen states have raised tuition prices by more than 20 percent since the Great Recession, and seven states—California, Arizona, Hawaii, Alabama, Georgia, Nevada, and Washington—have seen tuition hikes of one-third or more. The sharp rises in student charges since the Great Recession are closely linked to cuts in state funding for higher education. Figure 4 illustrates this connection, depicting both per-student funding cuts and average increases in tuition in the 10 states with the largest tuition increases since the Great Recession.
At the same time that states were cutting funding for higher education, families faced their own budget pressures due stagnant or declining incomes. As a result, paying for college requires a much larger share of the typical household’s income in many states. In a fully functioning system, much of this gap in ability to pay would be provided by financial aid and students working in side-jobs to defray costs. What we know, however, is that aid programs, such as federal Pell grants, have lost their purchasing power as a result of rising tuition and a greater number of eligible students. We also know that students are working more hours than ever before and taking on increasing amounts of debt. 

The result has been the debt-for-diploma system in which most students fill the gap between what their parents can pay, available grant aid and their earnings from part-time work, by taking on student debt. 
In seven states, tuition consumes more than 20 percent of the state median household income, while it consumes less than 10 percent of median income in five states. Figure 5 illustrates this affordability gap, depicting the most and least affordable states, ranked by the share of median household income consumed by the average 4-year public university tuition in the state. 
And as the full tables in the Appendix show, affordability is very closely linked to state funding levels: the five least affordable states—Vermont, South Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and New Hampshire—were among the lowest third of states in funding per student. Affordability is also closely linked to average student debt: the five least affordable states were all among the upper third of states, ranked by average student debt of graduates.8
Higher education is a true public good—its benefits accrue far beyond the individual who participates directly in the system. This is why, since the founding of public higher education, our nation has moved progressively toward expanding the doors of access. It is no accident that today some of the best state universities are land grant colleges—a legacy from the 1860s when the federal government granted federally controlled land to states to establish public universities and colleges. Over the next century and a half, federal and state policy continually improved to expand access and affordability to those who were left out of the system. But in the last generation, we have moved in the opposite direction. State higher education funding on a per-student basis is lower today than it was in 1980.9 Federal financial aid no longer provides grants robust enough to defray the rising cost of college: the Pell grant once covered $7 out of every $10 in college costs, today it covers only $3 out of every $10 needed to attend a public college or university.10
And so, the costs of funding our higher education system have increasingly been borne by students and their parents, chiefly by going into debt. Yet, higher education remains a public good—with all of us relying and depending on the system not just for the education of doctors, nurses, teachers, accountants and other professionals—but to provide the critical thinking that is the lifeblood of our democracy.

"How Higher Education Cuts Undermine the State’s Future Middle Class

"La práctica de la “manipulación de los distritos electorales sobre la base de la población reclusa” conocida como Gerrymandering, se produce cuando las personas encarceladas son incluidas como “residentes” de una cárcel durante el proceso de formación de distritos electorales para conceder más influencia política a los distritos donde hay cárceles. La Constitución de los Estados Unidos requiere que los distritos electorales sean aproximadamente iguales en tamaño para que todas las personas tengan la misma representación en el proceso político. Pero la manipulación de los distritos sobre la base de la población reclusa distorsiona nuestra democracia al inflar artificialmente los números de población— y por lo tanto la influencia política— de los distritos con cárceles, al tiempo que diluye el poder político de todos los demás votantes.
Este problema se debe, en gran parte, a la confluencia de dos hechos: (1) una metodología anticuada de la Oficina del Censo, que recuenta a las personas encarceladas como si fueran residentes en la cárcel, y no en sus domicilios legales; y (2) los altos índices de encarcelamiento en el país. Con optimismo, en el futuro la Oficina del Censo eliminará este problema al censar a las personas encarceladas como residentes en su domicilio legal. El año pasado, dos estados—Maryland y Nueva York— tuvieron la previsión de aprobar una legislación para eliminar la manipulación de los distritos electorales sobre la base de la población reclusa dentro de sus fronteras. Ahora, estos dos estados requieren que sus circunscripciones electorales se basen en los datos de un Censo que ha sido ajustado para considerar a las personas encarceladas como residentes en sus direcciones particulares. Delaware y California aprobaron leyes similares que entrarán en vigor en 2020. Históricamente más de cien condados rurales y municipalidades en los Estados Unidos han rechazado la práctica de La manipulación de los distritos electorales sobre la base de la población reclusa; en estos casos, la población encarcelada es excluida manualmente antes de delimitar los distritos para los gobiernos locales. Pero la mayoría de los estados y jurisdicciones se enfrentarán al problema de la manipulación de los distritos sobre la base de la población reclusa en el próximo proceso de redistribución de distritos electorales.
Cuando su asamblea legislativa proponga un plan para la redistribución de los distritos electorales y lo someta a información pública, usted tendrá que reaccionar rápidamente para identificar si las cárceles son utilizadas para distorsionar la democracia en su estado, condado, o ciudad y la manera exacta como lo hacen. Esta guía le explicará lo que ha de buscar en los datos y en el plan propuesto para minimizar el daño de la manipulación de los distritos electorales basada en la población reclusa.
(Esta guía presupone que usted cuenta con personal de mapeo o expertos técnicos que pueden ayudarle. Sus aliados técnicos pueden usar nuestro memorando, “Usar la Tabla Avanzada de Alojamientos de Grupos de la Oficina del Censo,” que explica el tiempo, el valor, los contenidos y las limitaciones del recuento de la población presidiaria del Censo.)
 
A veces, un distrito que pareciera tener una población de “mayoría-minoría” en realidad no la tiene por la manipulación basada en la población reclusa. Si la “población minoritaria” del distrito contiene un alto número de personas encarceladas—las cuales no tienen derecho a votar—las cifras de población del distrito pueden ser distorsionadas. Este fenómeno crea distritos que parecen dar a las minorías la posibilidad de elegir a su candidato preferido, pero en realidad no lo pueden hacer. Usted necesita examinar cualquier distrito mayoría-minoría para asegurarse de que el distrito tenga bastantes personas de minorías raciales que tengan derecho de voto para constituir una mayoría viable con la posibilidad de elegir a su candidato preferido para el cargo público.
Para resolver un pleito acerca de la Ley de Derechos de Voto, después de los Censos de 1990 y 2000 el Condado de Somerset, en Maryland, trató de delimitar un distrito en que los afroamericanos pudieran elegir con éxito a su candidato preferido. Pero la inclusión de una gran cárcel en el 1er Distrito de la Comisión dividió a la gran población residente de afroamericanos con capacidad para votar entre dos distritos. Como resultado, ninguno de los dos distritos fue capaz de elegir un candidato preferido por la comunidad afroamericana. El 1er Distrito pareció de mayoría afroamericana, pero en realidad el distrito no podía funcionar de la manera pretendida porque muchos de los supuestos “residentes” del distrito estaban entre rejas.
Otro efecto parecido, pero distinto, es que las poblaciones encarceladas a veces ofrecen una imagen falsa de la “diversidad” dentro de un distrito. Identificar estos ejemplos es una manera efectiva de introducir el problema de la manipulación de los distritos electorales basada en la población reclusa, y puede ser un fenómeno importante que debe destacarse si el estado tiene distritos poco poblados que contienen cárceles, como explicaremos en la próxima sección.
El 15% de la población del distrito 2B, en el Oeste de Maryland, delimitado después del Censo del 2000, aparece como si fuera afroamericana. Pero casi toda esa población afroamericana está integrada en realidad por residentes de otras partes del estado que están encarcelados y no pueden votar ni interactuar con la comunidad de ninguna manera. Casi toda la población real del distrito es blanca.
En 2002, el Senado del Estado de Nueva York delimitó distritos poco poblados en la región norte y distritos superpoblados en la región sur del estado de forma deliberada. Este problema es paralelo al hecho de que la Oficina del Censo contabilizó residentes del sur en recuentos de población del norte. Ambos hechos combinados sirvieron para diluir los derechos de voto de las minorías. Por ejemplo, uno de los distritos de norte era el distrito 59 del Senado, diseñado para sumar 294,256 habitantes en lugar de los 306,072 que cada distrito tenía que contener. Usando los datos del Censo, el estado reportó que el distrito tenía 6,273 afroamericanos, pero tres cuartos de esa población eran personas encarceladas que residían en otras partes del estado. La asamblea legislativa usó a la población de la prisión para ocultar el hecho de que el distrito tenía la población afroamericana más pequeña de todos los distritos del senado en el estado, y de forma deliberada delimitó un distrito poco poblado para darle más influencia política.
 
Los defensores deben investigar qué porcentaje de la población de cada distrito está realmente encarcelado, y cómo interactúa esa circunstancia con las desviaciones de población existentes en los distritos propuestos. Debe tenerse en cuenta que, en el extraño mundo de la redistribución de distritos electorales, los distritos “poco poblados” tienen más poder que los distritos “superpoblados.” Eso se debe a que en los distritos poco poblados un número menor de personas recibe la misma oportunidad para elegir un representante que un número más grande de personas agrupadas en un distrito superpoblado. Por lo cual, un distrito que apenas cumpla con la regla del 5% de desviación que se aplica a distritos estatales y locales, pero que no la cumpliría sin la población encarcelada, funciona como una señal de aviso para que sea examinado con cuidado a fin de determinar si es necesario disminuir la desviación. Aparte de esa situación particular, cualquier distrito que contenga una cárcel grande debería ser examinado para evitar la subpoblación de estos distritos en comparación con el tamaño ideal de los mismos, porque la inclusión de la población encarcelada magnifica la subpoblación del distrito.
Nótese que la situación inversa también es un asunto de preocupación, aún si no tenemos datos precisos del domicilio pre-encarcelación de las personas que actualmente están censadas como “residentes” de la cárcel. Por ejemplo, puede usarse el hecho de que las personas encarceladas debían haber sido censadas en su domicilio para argumentar en contra de la sobrepoblación extrema de distritos urbanos de los que procede un número desproporcionado de personas encarceladas.
Si no hay tiempo suficiente para recolectar los domicilios de las personas encarceladas para el proceso actual de redistribución de distritos electorales, los defensores de tal proceso deben considerar si se puede convencer a la asamblea legislativa de que declare que todas las personas encarceladas viven en “domicilios desconocidos” y que no las incluyan en los distritos individuales que contienen las cárceles. (La Entrevista con Justin Levitt, del Brennan Center for Justice, contiene más información acerca de por qué la técnica de “domicilios desconocidos” es mejor que el status quo de la Oficina del Censo.)
Si la asamblea legislativa se niega a excluir las poblaciones encarceladas de los distritos individuales, los defensores deben de examinar las opciones para limitar la magnitud del aumento de votos en cada distrito que contenga una cárcel. Los defensores deben determinar qué porcentaje de cada distrito propuesto está realmente encarcelado, y determinar si es posible reconfigurar los distritos para que múltiples cárceles grandes no se concentren en un solo distrito, y de reducir de ese modo el impacto del aumento de votos de los distritos con cárceles. Igualmente, si un solo sector censal contiene una gran cárcel, los defensores deben considerar si es posible dividir en dos partes el sector censal para que la población encarcelada pueda ser incluida en dos distritos distintos y, de esa manera, disminuir el incremento de los votos en cualquier distrito individual.
