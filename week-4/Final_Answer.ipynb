       "['This week we feature two letters that really grabbed our attention, from readers with compelling personal perspectives on the U.S. immigration system. Pull up a chair, and remember to write us at [email\\xa0protected]—Ken McIntyre\\nDear Daily Signal: I couldn’t agree more with Genevieve Wood in her recent commentary headlined “4 Keys to the Immigration Reform We Need.” My wife and I are immigrants from Canada\\xa0under an E-2 investors visa. \\nWe are two legal immigrants who invested our\\nlife savings in a small business called Shelley’s Casual Elegance Inc., specializing\\nin ladies’ fashions in South Florida. We left Canada in late 2005 and have\\nexpanded and improved the business continuously, spending well in excess of\\n$100,000 of our money and employing over a dozen American citizens in the past\\n14 years. \\nWe have spent over $25,000 in fees (government\\nand lawyers) to ensure that we comply with the requirements of the laws of the\\nUnited States, yet in spite of that, we have no “pathway to citizenship.” Our\\nE-2 visa does not give us permanent resident status, but in fact classifies us\\nas resident aliens who are permitted to stay year-round, but leave at least\\nonce every two years and return to comply.\\nWe would gladly become citizens if the law\\npermitted it, but instead have to go back to the U.S. consulate in Toronto\\nevery five years and beg for another extension to our five-year visa. \\nWe’ve done it a couple of times and as you can understand it is very stressful, knowing that we own a home here in Florida and\\xa0 for 14 years have been debt-free, supporting ourselves and\\xa0being\\xa0a valued asset to our community. \\nSelf-sufficient and married for 38 years, we get upset when people talk about giving amnesty to those who effectively have cut in line in front of law-abiding people like us.\\nHopefully, sanity will prevail and someday we’ll get a chance to be loyal citizens of this country. In the meantime, we have to go back to the consulate and hope the State Department staff person is not having a bad day when we appear in front of him or her.—Gary and Shelley Cahill, Naples, Fla.\\xa0\\nDear Daily Signal: Please allow me to honor my father, Francis L. Ross, a true American patriot. Born in Sioux City, Iowa, in 1930, he grew up dirt poor. \\nMy grandmother had grown up in a\\nhouse made of sod, and my grandfather’s only skill was horse trading. My\\nfather’s parents couldn’t even afford to buy my father a toy truck that cost only\\na nickel. \\nAt 9, my father stood in the snow\\nlate at night in bare feet. He watched while the only home he’d ever known\\nburned to the ground and left him with nothing but the pajamas he was wearing. \\nThe house my father’s family\\nsubsequently rented was so filthy he had to shovel chicken droppings out of it\\nbefore they could move in. In high school, his parents couldn’t afford a lock\\nfor his locker, so he couldn’t play football.\\nBut he believed in the American dream,\\nand that was all he needed to get ahead. When his country called on him to serve\\nin the Marine Corps, he did his duty without complaint. As a navigator, he flew\\n48 missions in Korea, sometimes with the bottom shot out of the plane. \\nWhen he returned to El Toro Marine\\nBase near Irvine, California, he married my mother. He attended UCLA on the GI\\nBill, not a handout. He earned a master’s degree in engineering and paid high\\ntaxes—as high\\nas 50 percent—for most of his life. \\nHe died in 2010 from cancer, hoping\\nhis children and grandchildren would live the same American dream. Unfortunately,\\nthat dream has been handed to people who have done nothing to deserve it. They\\nare only out for what they can get. \\nIf Americans are left with nothing in\\nthe process, so be it. According to the progressives, illegal immigrants are\\nsomehow morally superior to the rest of us.\\xa0\\nI am a senior citizen with a\\ndisability, and no doctor wants to treat me because Medicare pays only half or\\nless than what private insurance companies pay for. If doctors work for a\\nmedical group, they are contractually obligated to treat Medicare patients, and\\nso they deliberately inflict pain on me, frighten me, or anger me so I will go\\naway.\\nNow California Gov. Gavin Newsom\\nwants to give adult illegal aliens Medi-Cal, the Medicaid program in the state.\\nHis predecessor already gave the benefits to illegal alien children. \\nAbout the time he did so, I lost three\\nteeth. An unethical Medi-Cal dentist, I believe, destroyed two of them needing\\ncrowns on purpose, so that I would go away. The other tooth was pulled because\\nI didn’t have money for a filling. Medi-Cal no longer covers fillings, only\\ntooth pulling. For that, dentists receive $15 instead of the usual $75.\\nWhen I think of the sacrifices my father made so that his children could have a better life, I want to cry. \\nThose of us with ancestors and relatives who earned the right to be here are living a Third World existence, with the fear that the situation will get only worse as our elected representatives continue to hand our assets over to foreign invaders who erroneously believe it is their right to have them.—Melinda Santa Cruz, Escondido, Calif.\\nThis and That\\nDear Daily Signal: Why\\nare conservative media outlets dancing around the fact that the so-called\\nAntifa activists are no different than the Nazi Brownshirts and Blackshirts and\\nthe KKK?\\xa0 \\nWe have mayors, members of Congress, and the media supporting Antifa’s actions, thuggery, and extreme violence. These black-clad people belong in jail cells, and the people funding their actions should be arrested for aiding and abetting terrorism.\\nWhy hasn’t the Justice Department, FBI, and Homeland Security gone after the bagmen and thugs?\\xa0The mayor of Portland, Oregon, should be charged with violating the civil rights of those recently assaulted by Antifa thugs. \\nNotice any common denominators in locations that give these terrorists cover? Is the population of Portland so spineless it supports this kind of terrorism?—Chris Kastner\\n***\\nDear Daily Signal: Thank you so much for Heritage Foundation President Kay Coles James’ true and beautiful Fourth of July message to us, the commentary headlined “A Nation Worth Lauding.”\\nIt\\nwas very difficult to read. Tears kept blurring my vision. \\nGod\\nbless and keep my dear sister and fellow American. I’m thankful for her\\nleadership, faith, godly wisdom, courage, example, and love. \\nIf she ever decides to run for president (of the U.S., that is), she most definitely would have my vote.—J.D.\\n***\\nDear Daily Signal: I respectfully disagree with Olivia Enos’ commentary, “Trump-Kim Photo Op at the DMZ Fails to Deliver.” As long as Kim Jong Un isn’t shooting ICBMs over South Korea, Japan, and Hawaii, I think that President Trump is making significant progress with the unstable leader of North Korea. \\nNone of us expected Kim to\\n“instantly” shut down his nuke program.\\xa0 But Trump’s\\nunconventional negotiation process of sanctions\\xa0plus diplomacy is slowly\\nworking.\\xa0Kim may never shut down his nuclear testing, but as long he’s not\\nlaunching ICBMs, it’s a victory for Trump.\\nHow do you eat an elephant?\\xa0One bite at a time.—Allen Muench\\n***\\nDear Daily Signal: I want to thank your reporter Rachel del Guidice for the article regarding Alveda King and her comments about what Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has been saying recently regarding abortion and eugenics (“MLK’s Niece Applauds Clarence Thomas for Linking Abortion, Eugenics”).\\nI\\nhad forgotten that Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger was a consultant\\nfor the Ku Klux Klan. I also did not know that Alveda King is now working for\\nPriests for Life.\\nAlthough I am not able to afford a membership in The Heritage Foundation, I am praying for your organization and an end to the culture of death.—Mary Meurer, St. Louis, Mo.\\xa0 \\nHow Are We Doing?\\nDear Daily Signal: Thank you for The Daily Signal’s thoughtful, well-written news and commentary. Your articles are where I go for help sorting out the mainstream media and Fox News Channel, as they make their news about the moment, impact, and sensation. \\nWithout your insightful stories, I would be less informed about the goings-on of this world.—Howard Otton \\n***\\nI always thought that the “liberal” party in the USA was called the Democrat Party, composed of Democrats. It rankles when the party is labeled by the media as the Democratic Party. \\nIt\\nseems far less democratic than the Republican Party (composed, of course, of Republicans).\\nThe word “democratic” has a specific meaning and connotation that does not\\nbelong to the Democrat Party.—Stephen\\nJessee\\n***\\nI appreciate your news. Thank you for being a good source on illegal immigration.\\xa0I wondered if you know of some of the diseases that illegal aliens bring in, and are aware of the book “Fraud: How the Left Plans to Steal the Next Election,” by Eric Eggers.\\xa0We really must stop the hemorrhages.—Alice K.\\n***\\nPlease do not post tons of videos.\\xa0 We don’t need music, pictures, etc., to get our information.\\xa0At least include a script, so we can get the info and not be held hostage by endless videos.—Carol Stine\\n***\\nI enjoy The Daily Signal and appreciate the title and short blurb from each article included in your Morning Bell email. It would be nice if you also would add the author to each synopsis.—Marie Boyd\\n***\\nDo you think the left-wing corporate presidents (who the stockholders should vote out) and the left-wing media are trying to scare us into a recession in time for the 2020 election?—Robert Albanese\\n***\\nI absolutely love The Daily Signal.

       " 'Volunteers paint over a wall covered in graffiti. (Photo: Jose Luis Pelaez Inc/Getty Images) \\nThe “Bethel effect” is a term used to describe the community impact of Bethel Church in Redding, California. The congregation has gained national and international attention for its hands-on approach to serving the city.\\nPastor Kris Vallotton joins The Daily Signal Podcast today to explain how and why Bethel Church has chosen to love its community through action. He also explains how Americans can have real political impact and engage in dialogue with those who hold different views. Listen to the podcast or read the lightly edited transcript below.\\xa0\\nVirginia Allen: I am joined by Pastor Kris Vallotton of Bethel Church in Redding, California. He’s also a bestselling author, international speaker, and cultural leader. Pastor Kris, thank you so much for joining me.\\nKris Vallotton: Thanks for having me on. Allen: You’re the senior associate leader of Bethel Church and co-founder of Bethel School of Supernatural Ministry.\\nBethel has been gaining the attention of not just the church community, but people all over the world for quite some time. But recently, a lot of that attention has been focused around Bethel’s community impact, which we’re going to discuss a bit today. In fact, there’s been a phrase coined in Redding for this impact, and people have been calling it the “Bethel effect.” The San Francisco Chronicle wrote a great article about Bethel just a few months ago, saying that “no institution in our state is better at engaging with its hometown.” It went on to say that “the lack of structure and Bethel’s assistance to its hometown suggests a broader lesson for community building. Stop overthinking things and just throw yourself, heart and soul, into addressing people’s needs.” I mean, wow. It’s incredible to see the news media realizing the amazing impact this culture of service [at] Bethel is having in Redding and in Shasta County, where you are located. How have you all created this culture of service? Vallotton: Well, I don’t know that we’ve created it, actually, but let’s say we’ve influenced it. There’s a lot of participants, there’s a lot of heroes in the Redding culture that aren’t related to Bethel, of course, so I can only speak to the part that we play. \\nAnd that is, some years ago, we asked ourselves the question: If it’s supposed to be, if Jesus taught us to pray that it would be on earth as it is in heaven—and our city at that time, about 17 years ago, was listed as one of the worst cities under a hundred thousand people to live in—how are we supposed to affect that? … Our church attendance is around 11,000 people on a weekend, our city is 90,000. If a church of 11,000—not including a whole bunch of other wonderful churches in our community—are living in a community and the commentary of that community and the social statistics of that community are [saying] “This is the one of the worst cities in America to live in,” what does that say about our actual ministry? So we started asking ourselves the question, “Is this our problem?” As a church, as a leadership team, is this our problem? Are these bad statistics our problem? Or is the fact that they’re not our problem the problem? \\nIf we’re supposed to make disciples of nations, and we’re supposed to pray that it’d be on earth as it is in heaven, and we’re supposed to pray that God prospers and blesses our city, and the commentary on our city is completely opposite of that, what do we do about that? So that’s where it started. And we started realizing that the truth is that large churches don’t necessarily mean healthy communities. \\nI wrote a book that you might know about, it’s called “Heavy Rain.” And in that book I was doing a statistical study. We did a statistical study on American cities, and we learned that the cities that had the greatest Christian churchgoing population had the worst social statistics in our nation. You know, Jesus said, “You’re the light of the world.” And the problem is that most of the church thinks that the world needs to get darker and darker and the church gets brighter and brighter until Jesus gets back. \\nBut Jesus didn’t say, “You’re the light of the church.” He said, “You’re the light of the world.” So if the world’s getting darker and darker, it feels like it might be our responsibility to bring some light and hope. … Jesus is called the hope of the nations, so maybe we’re supposed to play a different role in our city. \\nIt began with, if you will, a theological, philosophical change. Like, this is our responsibility. It’s our responsibility to actually bring heaven to earth. It’s our responsibility to bring the full impact of a good God and a prosperous kingdom to bear on a broken city. Allen: You all have taken that responsibility on in really, really practical ways. I want to ask you about the Carr fires in the summer of 2018. Obviously, devastating across Redding and Shasta County. Vallotton: Totally. Allen: You all were in the center of some of the worst destruction. What was your community’s response to that tragedy? Vallotton: Well, our City Council did a wonderful job. Several believers on the City Council went to Santa Rosa, where they’d had a very similar fire two or three years before, and counseled with them and said, “What did you learn from your tragedy?” And they brought back some great information there. \\nWe said, “What can we do to help relieve the pain that’s happening in our community?” Of course, we opened up our church building, we partnered with the Salvation Army. We became the distribution center for food for several weeks, I think it was two or three weeks. And then we called out to our friends and said, “Can you help us? We’ve got 1,100 homes that have burnt down.” And we raised $1.7 million in two weeks from our friends around the world who just gave us money to help distribute. So we distributed a thousand dollars to every person who had lost their home, Christian or not. It didn’t matter if they went to church or didn’t go to a church. \\nThen several of them were able to go back and give some more money too. And then we developed a team of people that went through and sifted through the ashes. It’s pretty traumatic, you know? You had to wear a hazmat suit, it was 105 degrees out. And we just went from house to house sifting through the ashes to find valuables. It sounds crazy, but that was really profound. \\nAnd then when it was all over, and we developed a team—and Joyce Meyer’s ministry partnered with us, which was beautiful—we were able to take  almost $800,000 and buy equipment, because you can’t rebuild a house until you clear the property. \\nWe were able to buy tractors and chippers, and hire two full-time teams that just went from house to house and took down all the burnt trees and chipped them and got their property ready to rebuild. And we’re still in that process. We have two full-time teams right now that’ll probably spend another year and a half finishing just those properties. Allen: Wow, that’s amazing. … Obviously, Bethel got a lot of attention around the Carr fires, but it wasn’t a new thing to start reaching out and influencing. When the Redding Police Department was about to lay off four officers due to tight budgets, you all raised the money to keep them on the force. You volunteered your time and resources to clean the large, iconic Sundial Bridge in Redding when it was in need of repair. \\nWe all know that, yes, we’re supposed to care for the poor and care for those in need, but you all have taken this holistic approach to community-building and to caring for the community. Why did you feel like that was so important? Vallotton: Well, it’s our city. One of the things that we are learning together is that until you take ownership of your land, you’ll never be part of the solution. When you think about how important land was to the promises of God, you remember the children of Israel were in bondage for 400 years and God wanted him to lead them into a promised land. \\nThink about 1st Chronicles 7:14, “If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves to pray, seek my face … ” and so on and so forth, “I will hear from heaven, forgive their sins, and heal their land.” And it just goes on and on and on. \\nWhat we learned is that you just won’t solve the problem of your city without taking ownership of it. And we began to say, “This isn’t just a city, this is our city. This isn’t just a people, this is our people.” \\nI think that you’ll see that that strategy is throughout the book of Nehemiah, in the resolution of the broken walls. You know, the walls of Israel were broken down for 114 years. They had tried to rebuild them for 72 years. And what they couldn’t do in 72 years, Nehemiah did in 52 days. One of the secrets of the restoration of the walls and gates of Israel is that he made everyone an owner, and even families worked on the wall together. … \\nSo we say, “This is our city…” And so we began to take ownership of it. \\nAs you know, we put 2,500 students to work in our city every week. Every single student has to work in our city as part of their education. When students graduate from our school and they go back to their homes, we want them not just to think about, “How do I lead someone to Christ?” We want them to think, “What can I do to make my city a better place to live in?” Allen: What are some of those practical tools that you give your students or church members who move on to other communities? Because it’s easy to hear all the amazing work that Bethel’s doing and think, “I want to do that here in my own city.” But honestly, it’s a little overwhelming when you don’t have a lot of resources. And maybe you’re the only one in your community that’s really gung-ho about this. \\nSo what would you say to someone that maybe is in a church of 100 or 300, or has a community group of 15, and wants to start doing this? Vallotton: First of all, I want to say, don’t despise the day of small beginnings, because if I explained to you where we started 17 years ago, you would be like, “Oh, how is that going to help?” It’s like, well, you have to start somewhere, you know? \\nIn those days we had no money, and we had a much smaller sphere of influence, and my congregation was much smaller. So we just began to reach out. You can’t do everything, but you can do something. You can’t help everyone, but you can help someone. So we just began to evaluate, like, “How can we help?” The first thing that we did, personally, is we went to see our city manager, and we said: “This is what we’re kind of good at, and we’d love to help, and we don’t know what is your vision, and is there any place where we can help?” And you can imagine it takes a long time to build trust. I’d say it took three to five years to build trust. \\nBut we didn’t come in and say, “Hey, here’s our vision. We’d sure like the City Council to vote in this way.” And, “Why aren’t our roads being fixed?” And, “How come you’re not … ” We didn’t do that. \\nWe went to our city manager and later to our City Council, and we said,        “[These are] the resources we have, and these are the people we have. Is there any way we can help?” Our city manager was very gracious, and he said, “Well, we have a very reduced park and rec budget. We’re not able to clean adequately our parks and our recreation areas, and if you have any desire to do that … ” \\nWe’re like, “Yeah, we’ll do that.” … \\nThe first year was terrible; we did a terrible job. We’d put 50 students on a team with five rakes. We’d have 45 people standing around. [We] just didn’t think through it well. But eventually, we hired a person to be in charge of that. I would say in a smaller church, obviously, you’d have a volunteer. \\nAnd little by little, we bought $1 million worth of equipment. We didn’t do that right away, we did it little by little. We bought tractors and trailers and chainsaws, and we started a certification program for landscape. \\nBut you know, what we did is we just did ordinary things in a way no one had ever seen before. We did simple things like clean a park, but when we were done cleaning that park, no one had ever seen a park cleaned like that. When they gave us streets to sweep, we swept streets like no one had ever seen before. \\nWhatever they gave us to do, no matter how menial the task, we did it like Michelangelo, who said, “I saw the angel in the stone and I carved to set it free.” I’d say, “We aren’t raking lawns, we are freeing angels.” \\nAnd we just began to have a vision to prove to our city that we as a people of God have a spirit of excellence on us, and whether you give us a little project or a big project, we were going to handle it with responsibility and excellence and a great attitude. Allen:\\xa0I love that, that’s so good.  I want to take a moment and dive a little bit deeper into this idea of impacting culture, and discuss it from a political perspective. \\nYou know, today, if I say the words “America’s political culture,” a lot of thoughts and opinions will instantly jump into someone’s mind. But Bethel uses the word “culture” quite a lot. And you specifically talk about creating a culture of honor. \\nCan you explain what you mean by that, and what you think it looks like to bring a culture of honor into our political conversations? Vallotton: First of all, I think it means that every individual deserves honor no matter their opinion, whether it be political opinion or other opinions of life. Whether it’s around the subject of the gay community, or whether it’s the Republicans, the Democrats, the Independents, whatever. I think no matter your stance, because you are created by God, you are a child of God, you’re a son or daughter of God. So I think that we have to realize that we can have very different opinions and still value somebody. And I think when President [Barack] Obama was president, he didn’t carry a lot of my moral values in his presidency, at least publicly, I never have met him personally, but [he was] my president. And he’s a son of God. And I would post on my Facebook pages and social pages, and from the podium I would say, “I love President Obama. He’s my president. I pray for him.” \\nSome of our people in our movement, which tend to be quite on the Republican side, they’d write me some really strong statements, and I’m like, “I never said I agree with President Obama. I said I love him and I’m praying for him.” And now President [Donald] Trump is president, and I do the same thing with President Trump. I love him and I pray for him. Whether I agree with him on issues or on every issue, that’s not the point. \\nWhat’s going to happen if we stop praying for people? What happens when Christians pull out of culture? And when we vacate culture, we’re leaving that culture to the demonic realm, to lead that culture. And that’s just dumb. So if you want to actually have influence with the king or the queen, you don’t want to throw rocks at the palace. So I think that you have to decide if you want to be a Daniel, Joseph, or Esther. If you want to actually have influence in our country, in the White House, or with your mayor, or with your governor, throwing rocks at them—especially on a public platform—just doesn’t make any sense. So I understand the frustration that people have, and I’ve had it myself and I haven’t always gone about it right. But if I’m going to have any influence with someone I don’t agree with, I’m going to have to treat them honorably. Because you only have as much influence in people’s life as they have value for you. If they don’t have any value for you, you’re not going to be influencial with them. So that’s kind of our stance. Allen: That’s great. And Kris, you have built relationships with a number of national and international political leaders who span across the political spectrum. So how do you go about honoring those leaders in your interactions with them? Vallotton: Yes, absolutely. Well, I met with political leaders for the last 14 years in several countries and on both sides of the aisle. And when I meet with a Democrat or a Republican, I’m not there to talk through their view on abortion. If they want my opinion, I gladly bring it. But I’m there with this one agenda: “How do I make your life better? How can I help you fulfill the call that God has put on your life?” \\nAnd if you’re a Democrat, if you’re a Republican, my job isn’t to question your political values as much as it is to bring wisdom to the decisions that you have to make every day. \\nSome people are like, “I don’t see how you could sit with that person who’s pro-abortion.” I’m like, “Well, did you see how Daniel related to Nebuchadnezzar and four worldly kings?” \\nI truly do not understand how people cannot have grace in America for politicians that they don’t agree with when we see so much grace demonstrated, even in the Old Covenant, by Joseph, Daniel, and Esther. \\nI ask myself every day, “How could you be so critical of our president?”— whether it’s a Democrat or Republican president. And, “How do you expect to influence that president if you post horrible stuff about them?” \\nAnd especially the kind of stuff where you judge their motives: “Oh, you’re trying to kill babies,” or, “You’re trying to destroy our country.” It’s like, “Oh, gosh.” Stuff that’s just not wise, you know? And it’s also not true. Allen: Thank you so much for sharing that. And I want to ask you, you have so many great resources on this topic and a host of others, so how can our listeners learn more, follow your work, and find out more about what Bethel is up to? Vallotton: They can get on my website, kvministries.com … I am on all the social pages. Or you can get on bethel.com and find out everything you want to know about Bethel. And there’s all kinds of free resources on both those sites if you like what you see there. \\nAlso we have, obviously, webcasts and podcasts and Bethel TV. You can get on Bethel TV and watch what we preach in the morning for free, and it’s quite extensive. Allen: Awesome. Pastor Kris, thank you so much for your time and for joining me today. Vallotton: Virginia, thank you so much for having me on. I hope I helped some people. Allen:\\xa0Absolutely. Really appreciate it.',\n",

(Photo: J. David Ake/AFP/ Getty Images)\\nJustice Clarence Thomas is famously quiet on the Supreme Court. But a new movie, “Created Equal: Clarence Thomas in His Own Words,” is drawn from an exclusive interview with Thomas. Filmmaker Michael Pack shares what he learned about Thomas.

Pack is the director of the soon-to-be-released documentary “Created Equal: Clarence Thomas in His Own Words.” The movie is set to come out on Jan. 31. Michael, thanks so much for joining us on The Daily Signal.\\nMichael Pack: Thank you for having me.\\nStepman: First off, explain the thread of the documentary. I mean, Clarence Thomas wrote a memoir, “My Grandfather’s Son,” many years ago, but it seems that many Americans don’t know a lot about Clarence Thomas the man. Does the documentary delve into his childhood, his upbringing, his past?\\nPack: It does, I mean, exactly. Most Americans don’t know about it. And really the purpose of the film is to tell his whole story and to dispel the myths and fabrications that have grown up over the years. \\nThe format of the film is called “Created Equal: Clarence Thomas in His Own Words” because it’s mainly Justice Thomas speaking directly to camera and telling his story from birth all the way up to today. \\nIt’s based on a three-hour interview that I conducted with Justice Thomas and Ginni, his wife. And only them. There are no other interviews.\\nHe tells his story as he sees it from the very beginning, right to camera. There are recreations, there’s archival footage, there are stills, but there’s no other interview. You hear the story from Justice Thomas because it’s a great story, and in talking to people, he was overwhelmingly the best to tell it. He’s a great storyteller with a wonderful voice.\\nStepman: Yeah. That really will be something, especially as Thomas is notably quiet on the Supreme Court. Getting to actually hear this from Thomas himself seems to be one of the most interesting aspects of this documentary.\\nOne thing that really struck me, certainly about Thomas’ life, is his kind of political transformation. Obviously, [he] had rich experiences growing up. [He] grew up in, at the time, [the] still-segregated state of Georgia. Obviously, some harrowing times there. \\nBut he really had a political transformation. He really was, as a young man, a man of the left, I think [he] even supported the Black Panthers and ended up as an appointee of the Reagan administration, obviously, an appointee to the Supreme Court of Republican President George H.W. Bush. \\nCan you kind of explain that transformation? Because it seems kind of wild on its face.\\nPack: Well, that’s right. That’s one of the reasons it’s a great story, because it’s … not only a Horatio Alger story of going from dire poverty and segregation, as you said, to the highest court of land, but of these political, emotional, spiritual changes. And he’s very articulate about it. \\nAs you say, he was born in the South, he was born in Pin Point just outside of Savannah, Gullah Geechee area. So he grew up speaking a dialectic, a Geechee dialect, not even English. They were dirt poor. His mother worked in a crab factory. But they had a lot to eat. It was relatively idyllic. \\nAnd then she moved to Savannah where she worked as a maid and took care of Justice Thomas and his brother. But she just couldn’t make ends meet. He was hungry. He was cold in the winter. She’d take him to school, he’d wander the streets. It was really dire poverty of a kind few experience and in the midst of the segregated south.\\nSo then, [when] he was about 8, she brought him to her father, his grandfather, to raise because she realized she couldn’t take care of him. And that is what turned Justice Thomas’ life around. His grandfather who was poor and nearly illiterate, but he had a small home heating oil business. \\nHe gave Thomas and his brother a decent home, discipline, hard work, values. He had converted to Roman Catholicism. He sent them to parochial school, also a segregated school, but run by Irish nuns who gave him more discipline, a great education. And that really turned his life around from the sort of drifting in poverty to this new path. \\nAnd he was so successful. He wanted to study to be a priest and he entered seminary and he would’ve been one of the first African American priests in Savannah. But as you implied, or as you said, he became disenchanted with all that. \\nIt was the late ’60s, … he was watching Martin Luther King [Jr.] being shot on TV in ’68 and one of the seminarians said, “I hope that son of a b—- dies,” and that was just too much for Justice Thomas. It was just too much racism there. The church was doing too little about civil rights, and then he flipped and felt, “No, this is all wrong.”\\nAnd he lost his vocation. He said he wanted to leave the seminary. \\nWhen he told his grandfather, his grandfather kicked him out, the only home he had ever known and he was adrift and he became an angry black man. He saw race and racism explained everything. His grandfather was a sucker, but he was on his own, he had to go wherever he could.\\nHe happened to have a full scholarship at Holy Cross College in Worcester, Massachusetts, a Catholic school. He went up there and there he partook, as you said, in the black radicalism of the ’60s. He helped form the Black Student Union. He engaged in walkouts. As you said, he invited a Black Panther to come speak on the campus. And as Thomas said, they were supporters of everybody who was in your face, Angela Davis, Huey Newton, whomever.\\nAnd then a large part of the film is Justice Thomas’ turning away from that, recapturing his faith, coming back to Catholicism, his discovery that all the programs on the left were not working, especially busing in nearby Boston and affirmative action and a lot of the ideas and anti-Americanism of the black radicalism no longer appealed to him. \\nHe sort of started to see through it and drifted to the right until, as you say, he finally went to work for the Reagan administration in the ’80s, and worked first in the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Education, and then the EOC. And then finally he was nominated by George H.W. Bush for the Supreme Court and had that extremely contentious confirmation battle.\\nBut from the time he went to work for Reagan and was a public figure, he was battling people who didn’t agree with him. Civil rights leaders, people on the left, people who said, as he says in the documentary, that he was the wrong kind of black man. \\nSo it culminated in the hearing and that’s a very dramatic story and he tells it in a very moving way. And then he talks about the jurisprudence on the Supreme Court.\\nSo you’re right, it’s a very complex story. It’s hard to understand if you don’t hear it directly from Justice Thomas, which viewers will be able to do.\\nStepman: Of course. What made you tell this story of Clarence Thomas now? Does this have anything to do with the recent confirmation battles over Brett Kavanaugh? Did it have to do with some of his tussles with Joe Biden? Why now? Why come forward with the story at this point?\\nPack: Well, documentaries take a long time. We’ve been working on it for almost three years, but I have to say, it’s become more relevant. \\nThe Kavanaugh hearing happened in the middle of our production period. The #MeToo movement happened. But I think all that makes it very important to hear a Thomas’ story. \\nThe #MeToo movement likes to say that Anita Hill is its Rosa Parks, founding mother of the movement. But it’s good to look at the real story. I think your podcast is very focused on correcting the myths of history, and that’s a myth.\\nAnd the same thing with the Brett Kavanaugh hearing. It was, in a lot of ways, a replay of the Thomas hearing. A lot of people noticed that on both sides. So it’s worth thinking about what it was that was replayed. \\nI think it’s very current for the time. But I actually think it’s current beyond the time. I think Justice Thomas’ story is a great story, a great American story, and will be 20 or 30 years from now as well as now. \\nAlthough I think it’s ripe for the moment, it’s beyond that. I think it’s an inspiring story of overcoming great obstacles, of resilience in the face of many, many challenges. And of somebody who could easily have defined himself as a victim and chose not to. \\nIt’s a great illustration of that path, which is maybe not adequately celebrated today. So I think although it’s of the moment, it’s beyond that.\\nStepman: Yeah, absolutely. And to get more [to] the connection to now modern politics, you could say one of the more interesting aspects in the movie is getting into Thomas’ confrontations and his battles in the Senate, especially with now-presidential candidate Joe Biden, who was the chairman, I believe, of the Judiciary Committee at the time.\\nToday is actually the anniversary, the 47th anniversary, of Roe v. Wade. Obviously, Clarence Thomas has been critical of that decision. That did come up during his hearings. But there’s actually an interesting moment. \\nI wonder if you could explain where Thomas actually talks about his battles with Biden and some of the debates over natural law jurisprudence in the Constitution. Can you kind of talk about that a little bit?\\nPack: Yes. Justice Thomas’ attitudes toward natural law are actually a theme of the film and his sense of how natural law and originalism inform his jurisprudence. \\nBut in the first part of the hearing, Biden asked extremely complex philosophical questions along those lines. But for Justice Thomas, it was that they were a meandering way to get him to say something about Roe and to commit himself. And I think this was the first part of the hearing. \\nSome people don’t remember that his hearings had two parts. There was a week of very grueling testimony where the Biden inquiry came in. And also they accused him of lots of stuff—smoking marijuana, being an anti-Semite—that he had to answer that was in the press. Plus, very tough grilling.\\nThen he felt it was over. And these senators had voted split on the committee, but sent his name forward. And then when this full Senate was getting ready to vote, the Anita Hill allegations were leaked. And then it went back to the Senate Judiciary Committee. \\nSo it’s in the first hearing that Joe Biden sort of pressed him on natural law, as Justice Thomas says, as a way to get him to say something about Roe that they could use as a reason not to confirm him. … Since you say, it’s the anniversary of Roe, many, many of the groups opposed to him had that as their explicit reason for doing it. I mean, it was a very political, very concerted effort.\\nStepman: Yeah. Again, there seems to be some connection, especially when you talk about the modern Kavanaugh hearings as well, that that issue seems to come up very big and play prominently. \\nAnd then, of course, you get the ugliness of the accusations, the sexual assault, and, of course, the media really plays into that as well in creating that storm. \\nSo one question I think I’d like to ask is who is your intended audience of the movie? If you could sit any group of people in this country down and say, “Watch this movie,” who would it be?\\nPack: I really made the movie for people who don’t know Justice Thomas and don’t have their minds made up. Those are beyond just your listeners. \\nI believe it’s convincing to people who don’t know him and have many of these misconceptions: he’s quiet, he doesn’t speak, he’s not smart, he doesn’t have many opinions, he’s not active on the court. And I think you can’t think that after you see this film.\\n … It’s going to be in movie theaters, as you said, Jan. 31. And the people who are partisans of Justice Thomas and maybe your listeners need to go and show up and buy tickets. The people on the other side are very good at doing that. \\nOur film is often compared or contrasted to “RBG,” about Ruth Bader Ginsburg. It did fabulously well at the box office. All of her fans … showed up. So the people who might be sympathetic to Thomas have to show up, too. \\nIt’ll be in 15 or so theaters on Jan. 31, and if people show up, it’ll be in many more. They can go to our website, JusticeThomasmovie.com, and see where it’s playing in their area. And if it’s not playing and there’s a big enough group of 30 or 40, we can make a showing in the area that they are [in]. There’s ways to sign up for that on the website.\\nSo the purpose of the film is really to bring Justice Thomas back to the prominence and respect that he deserves. And I don’t think that will happen unless there’s some groundswell out there. So I hope that your show helps create that groundswell.\\nStepman: Yeah, we definitely hope so, too. \\nIt’s interesting. There were some controversies at the African American museum here in Washington, D.C., that Clarence Thomas didn’t get enough of a prominent position. \\nObviously, you could say, at this point, [he’s] one of the greatest Americans who’s been on the Supreme Court, and has an incredible story. I think that’s inspirational, especially for young Americans who do grow up in bad circumstances. \\nI mean, few have experienced the kind of struggles that he did as a young man and yet rose to this position and became not just a man who succeeded but is such a learned man and understanding of the law, really one of the most prominent positions in American life. \\nIt seems that a lot of young Americans, in particular, can learn from that story and create an inspiration that they can empower themselves rather than feeling like victims.\\nPack: Absolutely. That is really true. And we hope that beyond its time in theaters and on TV, or wherever it goes, that we’ll be able to get excerpts from it and curriculum materials into schools [for] Black History Month. There’s a lot of counter narratives to that. \\nThe 1619 Project has curriculum materials and Black Lives Matter and there’s [the] reparations movement. And we hope that our film, or parts of our film, with curriculum materials can be incorporated into every high school across America because I think it is inspiring to young people, especially African Americans, but not only. And I think it’s a counter narrative to the sort of victimhood that many put forward. I mean, it’s another way of living your life that Justice Thomas illustrates, and I think it is very inspiring.\\nStepman: Yeah, that’s great. That’s definitely maybe a pro-1776, a man who’s actually experienced racism and terrible things in this country yet embraces the principles that made America great to begin with. Truly inspiring story, as you said, very much counters the opinions of some at the 1619 Project that directly counters and says that are founding ideals are wrong. So absolutely an inspirational story. \\nMichael, thank you so much for joining us. The name of the movie is “Created Equal: Clarence Thomas in His Own Words.” It’s out Jan. 31 and it’s definitely going to be a must-see. Thank you so much, Michael, for joining us.\\nPack: Thank you. And go to that website, JusticeThomasmovie.com.\\nStepman: Thank you very much.',\n",
       " \"White House counsel Pat Cipollone arrives Tuesday with President Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Jay Sekulow, for the Senate impeachment trial at the Capitol. (Photo: Mark Wilson/Getty Images)\\nPresident Donald Trump’s lawyers briskly completed final arguments against removing their client from office Tuesday, taking a fraction of the 24 hours allotted to them in the Senate impeachment trial.\\nTheir wrapup Tuesday after less than two hours—following two hours Saturday and eight hours Monday—was a stark contrast from House Democrats’ impeachment managers.\\xa0\\nThe Democrats logged three marathon days in the Senate, arguing for more than 21 hours in all for Trump’s ouster for abusing his power and obstructing Congress in connection with a July 25 phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\\xa0\\nNext, senators will be able to submit questions in writing for the prosecution and defense teams to answer for up to eight hours Wednesday and Thursday.\\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., announced late Tuesday that Democrats so far may have enough Republican votes to call witnesses in the trial.\\xa0\\xa0\\nHere are highlights of the Trump team’s closing arguments.\\nDuring their phone conversation in July, Trump and Zelenskyy briefly discussed Trump’s interest in Ukraine’s investigating the dealings there of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.\\xa0\\nThe younger Biden joined the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy firm, while his father was President Barack Obama’s point man on Ukraine policy.\\xa0\\nTrump also told Zelenskyy that he would like Ukraine to investigate whether that nation interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\\nAt the time, Ukraine’s president didn’t know that Trump had put a hold on $391 million in military aid, which he would release in September.\\xa0\\nEarly on Tuesday, Trump personal lawyer Jay Sekulow took on revelations reported over the past day about a Ukraine-related passage in former Trump national security adviser John Bolton’s forthcoming book.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe book, The New York Times and others reported, will say that Trump told Bolton he put a hold on the military aid to Ukraine because he wanted the former Soviet republic to investigate the Bidens.\\xa0\\n“You cannot impeach a president on unsourced allegations,” Sekulow said.\\xa0\\nHe cited another of Trump’s lawyers, Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, who said the night before that even if true, the incident did not rise to the level of impeachment.\\n“I want to be clear on this, because there is a lot of speculation out there,” Sekulow said. “With regard to what John Bolton has said … here’s what the president said, in response to that New York Times piece: ‘I never told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens.’”\\nSekulow was reading from Trump’s tweeted response to the Times’ story Sunday. He also invoked Alexander Hamilton’s sentiment on cautious impeachments.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“What we are involved in here as we conclude is the most solemn of duties under our constitutional framework: the trial of the leader of the free world and the duly elected president of the United States. It is not a game of leaks and unsourced manuscripts,” Sekulow said.\\xa0\\n“Hamilton put impeachment in the hands of this body, the Senate, precisely and specifically to be above that fray,” he said. “This is the greatest deliberative body on Earth.”\\nWhite House counsel Pat Cipollone gave the last argument, in which he made the case against continuing the trial with witnesses.\\nCipollone called on senators to end what another Trump lawyer had called the “era of impeachment” on Monday.\\n“The Senate cannot allow this to happen,” the White House counsel said, adding: “This should end now, as quickly as possible. Reject these articles of impeachment for our country and for the American people.”\\nSekulow argued that impeaching and removing a president through two articles of impeachment that do not allege a crime is a dangerous path to establish for future presidents.\\nHe said the words “danger, danger, danger” at several points in his closing argument.\\n“In our presentation so far, you have now heard from legal scholars from a variety of schools of thought, from a variety of political backgrounds. But they do have a common theme with a dire warning: danger, danger, danger,” Sekulow said.\\nSekulow said future presidents could be “paralyzed from their first day in office” if the Senate allows the impeachment standard for Trump to stand.\\n“To lower the bar of impeachment based on these articles of impeachment would impact the functioning of our constitutional republic and the framework of that Constitution for generations,” he said.\\nSpecifically, Sekulow said, this could intrude on a president’s foreign policy by giving the legislative branch veto power if lawmakers question a president’s intentions:\\nThe claim that foreign policy decisions can be deemed abuses of power—based on subjective opinions about mixed or sole motives that the president was interested only in helping himself–demonstrates the dangers of employing the vague, subjective, and politically malleable phrase ‘abuse of power’ as a constitutionally permissible criteria for the removal of a president.\\nSekulow stressed that elections are supposed to determine the next president.\\n“You are being asked to remove a duly elected president of the United States, and you’re being asked to do it in an election year,” he said, adding:\\nThere are some of you in this chamber right now that would rather be someplace else. That’s why we’ll be brief. Why would you rather be somewhere else? Because you’re running for the nomination of your party. I get it. But this is a serious deliberative situation.\\nElections are the reason a president runs the executive branch and not executive branch employees who work for a president, White House deputy counsel Patrick Philbin said in making the first arguments of the day.\\xa0\\n“For two centuries, the president has been regarded as the sole organ of the nation in foreign affairs. So the idea that we are going to find out when the president had the wrong subjective motives by comparing what he did to the recommendations of some interagency consensus among staffers is fundamentally anti-constitutional,” Philbin told the senators.\\nThe House Intelligence Committee’s impeachment report to the House Judiciary Committee criticized Trump for acting in his own interest when he did not follow the recommendations of foreign policy advisers regarding his conversation with Zelenskyy.\\n“It inverts the constitutional structure. It’s also fundamentally anti-democratic because our system is rather unique in the amount of power that it gives to the president,” Philbin said, adding:\\nThe executive here has much more power than in a parliamentary system. But part of the reason that a president can have that power is that\\xa0he is directly, democratically accountable to the people. There is an election every four years to ensure that the president stays democratically accountable to the people. But those staffers in the supposed interagency who have their meetings and make recommendations to the president are not accountable to the people.\\nThere is no democratic legitimacy or accountability to their decisions or recommendations. That is why the president is the head of the executive branch. That is why he has the authority to actually set policy and make determinations regardless of what the staffers may recommend.\\xa0\\nOther coverage of the impeachment trial for The Daily Signal by White House correspondent Fred Lucas:\\xa0\\nUnder Bolton Shadow, 6 Big Moments From Day 6 of Trump Impeachment Trial\\n5 Big Points by Trump’s Lawyers as Defense Opens in Impeachment Trial\\n7 Big Moments in Democrats’ Final Arguments to Remove Trump\\n7 Highlights From Day 3 of the Trump Impeachment Trial\\n5 Flash Points From Impeachment Trial’s Opening Arguments\\nWhat to Know About Democrats’ 7 Impeachment Managers\",\n",

The\\ninternational community was outraged. The Israeli left called the idea nothing\\nshort of “apartheid.”\\nHowever, after the completion of the 440-mile border barrier—part concrete well, part wire fencing—suicide bombings and terrorist incursions into Israel declined to almost nil.\\nThe wall was not entirely responsible for enhanced Israeli\\nsecurity. But it freed up border manpower to patrol more vigorously. The\\nbarrier also was integrated with electronic surveillance and tougher laws against\\nillegal immigration.\\nThe wall also brought strategic and political clarity. Those\\nwho damned Israel but freely crossed its borders sounded incoherent when they\\nbecame furious that the barrier prevented access to the hated Zionist entity.\\nThe Trump administration is currently seeking funds to\\ncreate new border walls and replace old, porous fencing in order to stem\\nillegal immigration on the southern border.\\nThe strategy seems similar: The wall will free up manpower\\nfor better border policing. It likewise provides a certain political clarity.\\nThe United States is often criticized by Mexico and other Latin American\\ncountries. It is now being taken to task for the effort to make it more\\ndifficult to illegally enter such a supposedly unwelcome and hostile landscape.\\nFor years, Israel’s great weakness was its dependence on imported energy, while its neighboring enemies grew rich exporting oil and natural gas. Yet in the last decade, Israel has ramped up production to take advantage of its vast natural gas reserves—to the point that it is not just self-sufficient in fossil fuels but soon will become a major exporter.\\nNow, Israel cannot be threatened economically by either Iran\\nor various Persian Gulf monarchies. Its economy is stronger than ever. Europeans\\nsuddenly are more accommodating, given that Israel may well become a natural\\ngas exporter to a fuel-hungry Europe.\\nLike Israel, but unlike Europe, the U.S. was eager to frack\\nand horizontally drill to tap vast new fossil fuel reserves. The change in U.S.\\nstrategic energy independence is similarly astounding.\\nAmerica is now the largest producer of natural gas and oil in the world. Its output has increased world supply, dropped prices, and hurt America’s oil-exporting enemies.\\nThe relative power of Russia and Middle Eastern nations, such as Iran, over U.S. decision-making has radically diminished—along with the need to station huge numbers of American troops in the volatile Middle East.\\nAs in Israel, opponents either argued that more drilling would\\nruin the environment or that it would not work. They seem to be wrong on both\\ncounts.\\nIsrael’s foreign policy could be called Jacksonian. Israel allies with friends, neutrals, and former enemies whenever they share particular strategic goals.\\nIn the topsy-turvy Middle East, Israel is now sometimes a strategic partner with formerly hostile regimes in Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and other Gulf monarchies. They all share greater fears of theocratic Iran and its terrorist appendages in Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen.\\nApparently, much of the Arab world is no longer as\\ninterested in the Palestinian desire to destroy Israel. Many Palestinian groups\\nare allied with a despised Iran, while many Arabs believe that Israel’s\\nstrength can sometimes be strategically useful.\\nCurrent American realism is similar. The U.S. is neither isolationist nor an interventionist nation-builder. Its foreign policy goals are to enhance its military, expand its already powerful economy, limit its strategic exposure, and bank its resulting hard and soft power to use only as a deterrent force against those who kill Americans or endanger U.S. interests.\\nInstead of cajoling allies to join us in expeditionary wars\\nabroad, the U.S. increasingly appears reluctant to intervene, especially in the\\nMiddle East. As a result, former critics are now becoming suppliants requesting\\nU.S. assistance.\\nAs with Israel, the U.S. is less eager to apply political\\nlitmus tests to its occasional allies. It also seeks to avoid quagmires where\\nits overwhelming conventional firepower can be neutralized by terrorists and\\nurban guerrillas.\\nThe promoters of these unconventional policies, Israeli\\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Donald Trump, are both\\ndespised by their respective establishments and under constant threat of\\nremoval by their livid political opponents.\\nYet they both have transformed their respective countries. Their policies remind us that it is sometimes preferable to be respected rather than just be liked—and that when a nation is strong and does not beg for help, it often finds more than it needs.\\n(C) 2020 TRIBUNE CONTENT AGENCY, LLC.',\n",

Here’s a sampling.—Ken McIntyre\\nDear Daily Signal:  Anyone who wants to understand why American political life is so debased should consider what socialist influences have done to our public schools; that’s my response to Jarrett Stepman’s commentary (“I Went to a Socialism Conference. Here Are My 6 Observations).”\\nThe promises are\\nrelentlessly upbeat and even humanistic.\\xa0The reality is always more decay, more mediocrity, more people prevented\\nfrom reaching their potential.\\nMy thesis is that public\\nschools are the political reality served up billboard-size. Everyone can\\nunderstand if they bother to look. \\nFor example, public\\nschools claim to teach reading, but we have 50 million functional illiterates.\\nThat’s socialism in action, also known as liberalism, progressivism,\\ncollectivism, communism.\\nThe claims are always gimmicks to gain more power. The claims are always without sincere intent. This is the part that the ordinary citizen has trouble with: The people at the top promise things they never intend to deliver.\\nSummary:\\nCommies lie. Expect it.—Bruce Deitrick Price, Virginia Beach,\\nVa.\\n***\\nDear Daily Signal: When I was stationed with the Army in West Germany, a friend and I talked with an East German man in, of all places, the German Alps in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. \\nThe man had escaped from East Germany and was running from the KGB.

       " 'Multiple news outlets last week reported on a 2018 video recording in which two men with Ukrainian connections, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, apparently inform President Donald Trump that the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, was undermining his policy and asserting that he soon would be impeached. \\nIn response, Trump reportedly ordered: “Get rid of her.”\\nUnsurprisingly, this recording became part of the broader impeachment debate, which accuses Trump of abuse of power, even though Yovanovitch herself acknowledges that she “served at the pleasure of the president.” \\nThe Constitution vests the president with the authority to appoint ambassadors, with the Senate’s advice and consent. Although not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, the authority to remove officials is consistent with that authority, along with the president’s position as the head of the executive branch. \\nIndeed,\\nalthough the removal power has a convoluted\\nand complex history, it is strongest where the president’s constitutional\\nauthority—such as in the conduct of foreign affairs—is explicit and broad. \\nMoreover,\\nCongress has explicitly endorsed the president’s authority to remove and\\nreassign ambassadors though the Rogers Act of 1924 and the Foreign Service Act\\nof 1980, which established the rules, mission, and parameters of the U.S.\\nForeign Service. \\nIndeed,\\nthe U.S. Code (Title 22, Chapter\\n52, §3941(d)(2))\\nmakes explicit that “Chiefs of mission, ambassadors at large, and ministers\\nserve at the pleasure of the President.”\\nCongress\\nwas correct to support this authority. In addition to their diplomatic and\\nbureaucratic duties as head of a U.S. Embassy under the State Department, U.S.\\nambassadors serve as the president’s personal representative to a foreign head\\nof state and government.\\nAmbassadors are understood to speak for the president, and for this reason, serve at the president’s discretion. A relationship of less than full confidence is incompatible with the role. \\nIn practical terms, if a president lacks faith in an ambassador, there will be a strong incentive to circumvent him or her, possibly sowing discord and confusion. \\nThe proper remedy, instead, is removal. Ideally, the president’s authority to remove ambassadors should empower the State Department by bolstering the president’s confidence that its officials will faithfully execute his policies. \\nPeople\\ncan disagree with the president’s tone or comportment, but it’s clear that\\nYovanovitch had lost the president’s confidence. As such, he was perfectly\\nwithin his authority to call for her removal. ',\n",
       " 'Instead of a revolution that razes existing institutions from the top down, the authors envision a restoration that raises future generations to make change for good from the bottom up. (Photo: \\niStock/Getty Images)\\n\\nGreg Scott\\n/\\n@GScottSays\\n\\nGreg Scott is director of media for The Heritage Foundation.\\nIn an age of moral outrage and endless Twitter war, a more refreshing and hopeful vision of America’s future is a rare and welcome blessing. \\nA new book, “American Restoration: How Faith, Family, and Personal Sacrifice Can Heal Our Nation,” by Timothy Goeglein and Craig Osten is just such a blessing, and it comes at an opportune time, having just celebrated our nation’s founding.\\nA History Channel TV series—also coincidentally called “American Restoration”—tells stories of antique-restoration experts from across the country “as they not only restore pieces of America’s history, but create new and awe-inspiring works from vintage items.” \\nIn much the same way as these antique hunters apply their craft to uncover the underlying beauty of pieces from our cultural past, Goeglein and Osten reintroduce readers to the treasures—some all but buried—of self-governance, civil society, and personal virtue that our Founders left us, presenting these treasures in their original brilliance with a bright finish for tomorrow’s retelling.\\xa0\\xa0 \\nWhile the authors don’t completely avoid “back in the good old days” sentimentality, they do openly acknowledge and lament the sins of our country’s history, many that linger still today. \\nThis balance allows two deeply patriotic men, who rightly see our country as a force for good, to urge readers to look ahead, rather than behind, and to re-embrace the ideas that have sustained history’s longest-surviving experiment in liberty without being shackled to a sanitized retelling of our past.\\nEach succinct chapter offers a panoramic flyover of some\\nof the crucial cultural, political, and spiritual issues facing our country. \\nMost of the warnings are familiar—about dwindling\\nrespect for religious freedom, free speech, and the sanctity of life, along\\nwith a crumbling education system and an unraveling of America’s\\nJudeo-Christian consensus—but are foundational in understanding what problems\\nthe authors mean to help us solve and how.\\nThe strength that sets “American Restoration” apart from other offerings in the genre is its simple and practical advice. Instead of a garment-rending rehearsal of all that ails us, the authors instead elegantly and accessibly identify big problems and guide the reader to “own” their part in the American restoration. \\n>>> Listen to or read Timothy Goeglein’s interview with The Daily Signal\\nRecalling former House Speaker Thomas “Tip” O’Neill’s famous maxim that “all politics are local,” the authors insist that all politics are really, really local. \\nWhile they do believe that massive structural, spiritual, and cultural change is needed, Goeglein and Osten appeal to the reader to start from the inside, to inculcate virtue and character in the home with one’s own family, to love and fellowship with one’s neighbors, and to perform acts of service and mercy in one’s community. \\nInstead of a revolution that razes existing institutions\\nfrom the top down, the authors envision a restoration that raises future\\ngenerations to make change for good from the bottom up.\\nThe authors offer numerous\\nexamples of Americans who have transformed their esteem for our republic into actions\\nintended to “keep it”—some quietly in their communities in small ways and some\\nat great personal and professional risk on the national stage. \\nThe authors themselves take some risks, as their\\nproposed remedies are truly countercultural. \\nThey warn that radical individualism and demands for the customization of everything will not create a nation of contented citizens who have gotten exactly what they want. They argue that this continued trend fosters greater\\ndivision and feeds contempt for those outside the “tribe.” \\nTo say in a most narcissistic age that self-fulfillment is not the ultimate end, but rather a toxic pursuit, may be a new and dangerous idea for a generation brought up on the idea that its every thirst must be slaked—and now. \\nGoeglein and Osten urge readers to look inside\\nthemselves not to inquire of their appetites, but to subordinate them in favor\\nof seeking good for their neighbors. We should restore virtue. We should even\\nraise our boys to be gentlemen. \\n“Virtuous people are those who have learned to put the needs of others above their own, while moderating their behavior in a manner that keeps them from making poor moral choices that would not only negatively impact them, but would impact society as a whole,” they write.\\nVirtuous people, the authors say, are the key to\\ninaugurating the restoration of community, cohered by the “little platoons”\\nrepresented by strong families.\\nAnd this is where the authors say that Christians should\\nplay a leading role. \\nRegular attendees of biblically orthodox churches have not abandoned the model of family life that nurtures virtue. \\nAdditionally, churches represent some of the last remaining strong community-centric institutions. So, churches and their members have a special responsibility to reintroduce these blessings to a hurting world that desperately needs such a witness. \\nIn the final analysis, “American Restoration” is so hopeful because the authors’ “it starts with you” advice for cumulative cultural change at the most local level is so doable. \\nAnd if enough Americans in their homes, churches, communities, and civic organizations make it their mission to reignite the spirit that made our nation that “shining city on the hill,” Goeglein and Osten are optimistic that we will indeed see an American restoration.

Nope. \\nMaybe they don’t want to ask real questions because they\\nfear looking as dumb as then-Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, did at a hearing on\\nFacebook. He asked Mark Zuckerberg, “How do you sustain a business model\\nin which users don’t pay for your service?” \\n“We run ads,” smirked Zuckerberg. “I\\nsee,” said Hatch. \\nWhat’s obvious to most people somehow eludes the oblivious\\n“experts” in Congress. \\nAt another Facebook hearing, Congress grilled Zuckerberg\\nabout his plan to launch an electronic currency called Libra. Zuckerberg said,\\n“I actually don’t know if Libra is going to work, but I believe it’s\\nimportant to try new things.” \\nHe was right. But instead of asking about technological or\\neconomic implications of the idea, Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, asked Zuckerberg, of\\nthe companies partnering with him, “how many are headed by women?” \\n“Congressman, I do not know the answer,” replied\\nZuckerberg. \\n“How many of them are minorities?” asked Green.\\n“Are there any members of the LGBTQ+ community?” \\nGreen doesn’t want to learn anything. He wants to sneer and\\nscore points. \\nPoliticians’ sloppy ignorance is extraordinary. Rep. Steve\\nKing, R-Iowa, grilled Google CEO Sundar Pichai about iPhones, citing a story\\nabout his granddaughter using one, leading Pichai to explain,\\n“Congressman, iPhone is made by a different company.” \\nToday’s posturing is not what the Founders had in mind when they invented hearings in 1789. \\nGeorge Mason said members of Congress “possess\\ninquisitorial powers” to “inspect the Conduct of public\\noffices.” \\nYes! Investigate government. \\nBut today, they are more likely to threaten CEOs and bully\\nopponents. \\n“Are you stupid?” then-Rep. Darrell Issa,\\nR-Calif., said to one witness. They want to showboat, not learn. Often, they\\nask questions even when they know the answers. \\n“Ms. DeVos, have you ever taken out a student\\nloan?” asked Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., of Education Secretary Betsy\\nDeVos. “Have any of your children had to borrow money?” \\nWarren knows that DeVos is a billionaire, but she wanted to\\nscore points with her fans. \\nOne of the louder showboaters today is self-proclaimed\\nsocialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. She asked Wells Fargo boss Tim\\nSloan, “Why was the bank involved in the caging of children?” \\n“We weren’t,” replied Sloan. \\nSome of today’s hearings are useful in that we get to see\\nhow absurd and ignorant our representatives can be. \\nDuring a hearing on military personnel being stationed on\\nthe island of Guam, Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Georgia, said, “My fear is that\\nthe whole island will become so overly populated that it would tip over and\\ncapsize.” Really. He said that. \\nThen there was the time Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., chair\\nof the House Financial Services Committee, summoned bank CEOs to Washington and\\ndemanded, “What are you guys doing to help us with this student loan\\ndebt?!” \\n“We stopped making student loans in 2007,” Bank of\\nAmerica’s Brian Moynihan told her. \\n“We actually ended student lending in 2009,” added\\nCitigroup’s Michael Corbat. \\n“When the government took over student lending in 2010\\n… we stopped doing all student lending,” explained Jamie Dimon of\\nJPMorgan Chase. \\nThe chair of the Financial Services Committee didn’t even know that her own party kicked bankers out of the student loan business, insisting that government take over?!

(Photo: Lev Fedoseyev/TASS via Getty Images)\\n\\nRachael Menosky\\n/\\n@MenoskyRachael\\n\\nRachael Menosky is a research and administrative assistant for the Thatcher Center at The Heritage Foundation.\\nAggression by Iran and trade with China may dominate U.S. foreign policy headlines, but a plan recently announced by Russia to increase its presence in the Arctic should command our attention.\\nThe Northern\\nSea Route Development Plan—known as Plan NSP—marks a 15-year effort by Russia\\nto strengthen its involvement in the Arctic by focusing on developing the\\nNorthern Sea Route.\\nPlan NSP, approved by former Russian Prime\\nMinister Dmitry Medvedev on Dec. 21, “includes as\\nmany as 84 points and covers a wide range of priorities, from the development\\nof needed infrastructure and building of new ships to the mapping of natural\\nresources and launch of new satellites and meteorological equipment.” \\nThe plan,\\ndesigned to make Russia more mobile, resourceful, and powerful in the Arctic, calls\\nfor starting the project this year and completing it by 2035. \\nThe plan states that it is in accordance with the decree of the president of Russia, dated May 7, 2018, which declares that Russia needs to increase cargo flow through the Northern Sea Route by at least 80 million tons. \\nIn 2018, 18 million tons travelled across the coastline—an 80% increase from 2017. In 2019, 26 million tons of cargo passed through the area. With Plan NSP in place, land, air, and sea routes will become available for the transportation of both goods and people.\\nThis should\\nnot surprise anyone, because Russia in recent years has steadily increased its military\\nand economic presence in the Arctic in search of economic opportunity and\\nsought militarily to make the Arctic its own. In 2007, the Russians even planted their flag at the bottom of the Arctic Sea under\\nthe North Pole.\\nIn addition,\\nRussia has either renovated or built from scratch at least seven military bases in the region. It broadcast that Siberian huskies would be trained to pull military\\npersonnel and equipment into areas where military vehicles cannot handle the\\nterrain and disclosed it planned to install an “air defense\\ndome” made of S-400 missiles all across the region. \\nAlthough much\\nof Russia’s Arctic progress in the last few years has been dedicated to\\nsecurity, Plan NSP focuses heavily on the potential for greater economic involvement in coming years.\\nThe plan calls for a Northern Sea Route, which Russia hopes will become a boon\\nto a stagnant economy.\\nAccording to the plan, within the first half of this new decade, the Russian government will decide whether to continue building several rail lines across the country. By the end of 2022, the decision will be made whether to continue the Belkomur railway line that would link Perm in the Ural Mountains to the Arctic port city of Arkhangelsk. \\nIt also will decide on rail lines from Sosnogorsk to Indiga, from Sabetta to Novyj Urengoj that also could serve to boost Arctic commerce, as well as one that would run across the River Ob to Novy Urengoy and Nadym. The government also plans to finish the Murmansk Transport Hub, with a 46-kilometer railway and several port facilities all along the west of Kola Bay, by December of 2021. \\nFour civilian\\nairports will be upgraded in the coming years: Amderma in the west and Pevek,\\nChersky, and Keperveyem in the east. Additionally, a dredging operation in the\\nGulf of Ob, scheduled to be completed in December 2021, will allow for larger\\nvessels to pass through.\\nFinally, perhaps the most significant aspect of the plan is the launch of at least 40 new Arctic vessels, including eight nuclear-powered icebreakers and 16 rescue and support ships by 2035. Some of these ships will be Lider-class ice breakers, allowing them to break through extremely thick Arctic ice and open wide enough shipping lanes for large commercial ships. \\nPlan NSP also includes plans to upgrade several nuclear icebreakers and nuclear materials special-purpose vehicles. \\nThe United States and its Arctic allies would do well to closely follow not only Russian militarization of the Arctic, but also planned economic investments in the high north. The plan is an ambitious effort to expand Russia’s presence in the Arctic, but how much of that plan comes to fruition remains to be seen. \\nWhat is clear is that the way the Arctic continues to drive Russian strategic thinking should concern the U.S. and its allies.

       " \"The partisan nature of this particular impeachment will end up weakening not just Trump, but the office of the presidency. Pictured: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi addresses reporters Jan. 16 during her weekly news conference on Capitol Hill. (Photo: Mark Wilson/Getty Images)\\n\\nKay C. James\\n/\\n@KayColesJames\\n\\nKay C. James is president of The Heritage Foundation. James formerly served as director of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management and as Virginia's secretary of health and human resources. She is also the founder and president of The Gloucester Institute.\\nWhether the American people yet realize it or not, the House’s handling of the impeachment of President Donald Trump has inflicted serious damage on America’s constitutional system of government and threatened the very safety of our nation.\\nThe partisan nature of this particular impeachment will end up weakening not just Trump, but the office of the presidency. Every future president—Democrat and Republican—will be second-guessing his or her decisions to avoid crossing members of Congress and being threatened with impeachment based on the flimsiest of evidence.\\nThe latest alleged revelations from former national security adviser John Bolton don’t change the fact that last week, both lead House impeachment manager Rep. Adam Schiff and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer admitted that the House voted to impeach the president without the evidence to prove he was guilty, demanding that the Senate call witnesses so they could do more evidence gathering.\\nWhen Congress uses impeachment as a political weapon, it has the potential of stripping an enormous amount of constitutional authority from the presidency and shifting it to Congress. The House has created a precedent where future executives will feel compelled to run major decisions by Congress before carrying them out—even decisions that are solely in the president’s purview.\\nThe delay created while a president attempts to seek consent from Congress could cost American lives when quick, decisive actions are needed. Just think of the kind of havoc that could be wrought when such permission-seeking ends up delaying military action necessary to stop an attack on an American embassy, when it prevents counterterrorism measures required to thwart an imminent terrorist threat at home, or when it delays federal help to respond to a natural disaster threatening the lives of thousands of citizens.\\nThe office of the president has suffered additional long-term harm when one considers that when Trump chose to invoke executive privilege to prevent his staff from testifying in the impeachment hearings, the House charged him with “obstruction of Congress.” \\nThe long-held legal tradition of executive privilege allows a president to receive the best and frankest advice with which to make critical governing decisions, giving him and his staff the freedom to fully explore all sides of an issue.\\nThroughout my career, I was blessed to work in senior positions in both state and federal government, and I will say that those deliberations can be very messy—but also very effective. \\nTo function effectively, a president needs the ability to consult confidentially with his closest advisers. Taking that privilege away severely limits a president’s ability to serve citizens, as his advisers will be deterred from providing frank advice for fear their communications will be shared with millions—including foreign powers and political adversaries—on the evening news.\\nIf executive privilege is abused, Congress has the ability to take the president to court to challenge his claims. Yet the House failed to do that, perhaps surmising that, based on past precedent, the courts might disagree with it. \\nInstead, the House decided to charge the president with obstruction of Congress, despite the fact that executive privilege is a tool that many presidents have used and that the Supreme Court repeatedly has affirmed. Impeaching a president for invoking executive privilege essentially guts this important tool.\\nThe Constitution’s Framers were very concerned that impeachment would be used as a political weapon, as is happening today. They never meant it to be the “no-confidence vote” of parliamentary systems that create turmoil by changing leadership anytime such a vote is called. Impeachment was meant for presidents who engaged in crimes so grievous that removing them from office couldn’t wait until the next election.\\nWith this impeachment, the House has threatened our very constitutional system, effectively turning presidents into mere puppets of Congress, rejecting the idea of a separate and co-equal branch of government. In doing so, the House has damaged the unique system of checks and balances the Framers crafted to prevent any one branch of government from becoming too powerful.\\nThe House also has made the American people the casualties in the process. The mere threat of impeachment may be all that is needed to stop future presidents from implementing policies that they know are popular with the people but unpopular with the opposition party in the House. \\nIn the worst-case scenarios, presidents who become paralyzed in their decision-making about national security and natural disasters could end up putting Americans in harm’s way.\\nOnly time will tell the extent of the damage that has been done.\",\n",

Williams\\n/\\n@WE_Williams\\n\\nWalter E. Williams is a columnist for The Daily Signal and a professor of economics at George Mason University.\\nDuring President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial, we’ll hear a lot of talk about our rules for governing. One frequent claim is that our nation is a democracy. \\nIf we’ve become a democracy, it would represent a deep betrayal of our Founders, who saw democracy as another form of tyranny. \\nIn fact, the word democracy appears nowhere in our nation’s two most fundamental documents, the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution. The Founders laid the ground rules for a republic as written in the Constitution’s Article IV, Section 4, which guarantees “to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government.”\\nJohn Adams captured the essence of the difference between a democracy and republic when he said, “You have rights antecedent to all earthly governments; rights that cannot be repealed or restrained by human laws; rights derived from the Great Legislator of the Universe.” \\nContrast the framers’ vision of a republic with that of a democracy. In a democracy, the majority rules either directly or through its elected representatives. As in a monarchy, the law is whatever the government determines it to be. Laws do not represent reason. They represent power. The restraint is upon the individual instead of the government. \\nUnlike that envisioned under a republican form of government, rights are seen as privileges and permissions that are granted by government and can be rescinded by government.\\nHere are a few quotations that demonstrate the contempt that our Founders held for a democracy. James Madison, in Federalist Paper No. 10, wrote that in a pure democracy, “there is nothing to check the inducement to sacrifice the weaker party or the obnoxious individual.” \\nAt the 1787 Constitutional Convention, Edmund Randolph said that “in tracing these evils to their origin every man had found it in the turbulence and follies of democracy.” \\nAlexander Hamilton agreed, saying: “We are now forming a republican government. [Liberty] is found not in “the extremes of democracy but in moderate governments. … If we incline too much to democracy, we shall soon shoot into a monarchy.”\\nJohn Adams reminded us: “Remember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There was never a democracy yet that did not commit suicide.” \\nJohn Marshall, the highly respected fourth chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, observed, “Between a balanced republic and a democracy, the difference is like that between order and chaos.” \\nThomas Paine said, “A Democracy is the vilest form of Government there is.” \\nThe framers gave us a Constitution replete with undemocratic mechanisms. One constitutional provision that has come in for recent criticism is the Electoral College. In their wisdom, the framers gave us the Electoral College as a means of deciding presidential elections. That means heavily populated states can’t run roughshod over small, less-populated states. \\nWere we to choose the president and vice president under a popular vote, the outcome of presidential races would always be decided by a few highly populated states, namely California, Texas, Florida, New York, Illinois, and Pennsylvania, which contain 134.3 million people, or 41% of our population. \\nPresidential candidates could safely ignore the interests of the citizens of Wyoming, Alaska, Vermont, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and Delaware. Why? They have only 5.58 million Americans, or 1.7% of the U.S. population. \\nWe would no longer be a government “of the people.” Instead, our government would be put in power by and accountable to the leaders and citizens of a few highly populated states. It would be the kind of tyranny the framers feared.\\nIt’s Congress that poses the greatest threat to our liberties. The framers’ distrust is seen in the negative language of our Bill of Rights such as: Congress “shall not abridge, infringe, deny, disparage, and shall not be violated, nor be denied.” \\nWhen we die and if at our next destination we see anything like a Bill of Rights, we know that we’re in hell because a Bill of Rights in heaven would suggest that God couldn’t be trusted. \\nCOPYRIGHT 2020 CREATORS.COM\",\n",
       " 'A 2017 Supreme Court decision suggests that there might be as many as seven judges on the same side of this decision about religious schools and tax credits. (Photo: Getty Images)\\nShould families be able to use school choice tax credits on religious schools? That’s the question that’s at the heart of Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue, which the Supreme Court is hearing Wednesday. Heritage Foundation legal scholar and host of the podcast “SCOTUS 101” Elizabeth Slattery breaks down the case for us.

The case is Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue. Joining me to break it down is Elizabeth Slattery, a legal fellow here at The Heritage Foundation. Elizabeth, thanks for coming in.\\nElizabeth Slattery: Thanks for having me.\\nDavis: So this case is out of Montana. What exactly is the dispute over?\\nSlattery: Back in 2015, the Montana Legislature set up this tax-credit scholarship program that would provide scholarships for income-eligible children to use at qualified schools, private schools. \\nInitially, recipients could use the scholarship funds at any qualified school, including religious ones. But then the Montana Department of Revenue implemented a rule to exclude religious schools, citing a provision in the Montana Constitution that bars state funds from aiding religious organizations. \\nParents were relying on these funds to send their children to religious schools and they sued in state court. And that is the case that’s up at the Supreme Court.\\nDavis: So, the state Supreme Court ruled according to the state Constitution, but I’m assuming the Supreme Court is going to have something to say about the U.S. Constitution. Do you think the two might be in conflict here?\\nSlattery: Yeah. So, the parents raised federal constitutional claims in addition to some state law issues. And what the Montana Supreme Court ended up ruling was, it struck down the tax-credit program in its entirety. \\nIt said that, “Look, when the Legislature set this up, they were allowing funds to go to religious schools and our Constitution says that you can’t do that.” And so they struck down the program in its entirety. So no children can use the scholarship program right now.\\nDavis: You’ve written that the Supreme court’s recent ruling in the Trinity Lutheran case from 2017 might be relevant here as a precedent to maybe correct this ruling or overturn it. Can you explain that?\\nSlattery: Sure. Trinity Lutheran was a case out of Missouri from back in 2017. And that case involved a day care center that was run by a church. And they wanted to apply for this state-funded grant to help them resurface the playground at the day care center. But they were denied the grant solely because it was brought by a religious institution. \\nMissouri, likewise, has what’s called a no-aid [amendment] or a Blaine Amendment. Some people call them that in their state constitution. And this case went all the way to the Supreme Court. And the court held that Missouri had violated the federal Constitution by discriminating against an organization solely on the basis of religion.\\nDavis: So the parents in this Montana case, they’re going to argue the same thing. They’re going to say that this tax credit is a generally available public benefit and that, therefore, they should be able to use it to go toward religious schools?\\nSlattery: Yeah. And there’s an additional wrinkle here, particularly with regard to the no-aid provision because what we’re talking about here is a tax credit. So it isn’t actually state money that’s flowing to the schools. It’s people giving money to a scholarship-granting organization and then the money goes into the hands of a private actor or the parents to decide where to use that money. \\nAnd the Supreme Court, the U.S. Supreme Court has long held that there’s a distinction between direct government funding of religion and indirect funding such as a tax credit, in this case.\\nDavis: Zooming out, big picture, what’s really at stake in this case for other Americans who aren’t involved in this particular case?\\nSlattery: Between 37 and 38 states have similar no-aid provisions in their constitutions. And many of these states enacted these no-aid provisions. \\nThey’re also called Blaine Amendments … named for Sen. James Blaine, who tried to get the federal Constitution amended to prevent funds from going to what he called “sectarian” schools. And this was a code word for Catholic schools because he didn’t want funding of Catholic institutions or Catholic schools. \\nA number of states have these amendments. So you can see … in the Montana case how they can conflict with school choice efforts. And really this case is about just trying to allow parents to decide what the best educational opportunity is for their children and using programs like this tax-credit program to give their kids the best education that they can.\\nDavis: Right now the court is considered conservative by a 5-4 majority. What outcome should we expect from this case?\\nSlattery: Well, if we look at the Trinity Lutheran case from a couple of terms ago, that’s when Justice [Neil] Gorsuch had just joined the Supreme Court. Justice [Anthony] Kennedy was still on the bench. So we have switched Kennedy for [Justice Brett] Kavanaugh. But that was a 7-2 ruling. \\nSo Justices [Elena] Kagan and [Justice Stephen] Breyer joined with the so-called conservative members of the court to uphold the First Amendment and to find that what the state of Missouri had been doing was religious discrimination. So we could see a similar breakdown in this case. \\nJustice [Sonia] Sotomayor wrote a dissent back in Trinity Lutheran and Justice [Ruth Bader] Ginsburg joined her saying that they thought that the Trinity Lutheran case weaken the separation of church and state. But we’ll see what happens in this one.\\nDavis: And then with Kavanaugh, I would assume he’s even more likely to go conservative in this case?\\nSlattery: Based on his jurisprudence from the D.C. Circuit and the limited jurisprudence we have from the Supreme Court, he has been strongly in line with the conservatives when it comes to establishment clause and other First Amendment cases. So it’s hard to predict how cases are going to turn out because you never know what might happen. But I think that there is affirm majority that will rule to side with the parents in this case.\\nDavis: If that happens, does that automatically amend the other state constitutions that currently ban this practice?\\nSlattery: Not necessarily. So, the parents in the Montana case have argued that as the state court applied the constitutional provision, it violates the federal Constitution. But they can see that there could be other applications of this provision that are in line with the federal Constitution. \\nNow, interestingly enough, the Trump administration filed a “friend of the court” brief supporting the parents in the Montana case. And they say that these no-aid provisions should be struck entirely, but the parents who are the litigants in the case didn’t go quite that far in what they were asking the Supreme Court to do.\\nDavis: When should we expect the ruling?\\nSlattery: It’ll be by the end of June most likely. That’s when the court will wrap up for this term. And they have been issuing opinions, some of the ones from the fall setting. \\nI think since this is going to be argued in January, we may not see an opinion until maybe April at the earliest. But it may not be until the very end, which is the last week of June.\\nDavis: All right. Well, we’ll wait to see how the arguments go. If you want to listen to more of Elizabeth’s analysis of cases like this, check out her podcast “SCOTUS 101.” Elizabeth, thanks for your time today.\\nSlattery: Great to be here.',\n",
       " 'The Cleveland Cavaliers play against the New York Knicks on Jan. 20, 2020 in Cleveland, Ohio. (Photo: Jason Miller/Getty Images)\\n\\nWalter E. Williams\\n/\\n@WE_Williams\\n\\nWalter E. Williams is a columnist for The Daily Signal and a professor of economics at George Mason University.\\nIt’s nearly impossible to have even a short conversation with a college administrator, politician, or chief executive without the words diversity and inclusion dropping from their lips. \\nDiversity and inclusion appear to be the end-all and be-all of their existence. So, I thought I’d begin this discussion by first looking up the definition of diversity.  \\nHere’s my question to those who are wedded to diversity and inclusion: Are people better off the less they have in common with one another? \\nFor example, women are less likely to be able to march 12.4 miles in five hours with an 83-pound assault load. They are also less likely to be able to crawl, sprint, negotiate obstacles, and move a wounded comrade weighing 165 pounds while carrying that load. \\nWould anyone argue that a military outfit would benefit from diversity by including soldiers who can and those who cannot march 12 miles in five hours while carrying an 83-pound load?\\nAccording to the Oxford Dictionary, diversity is “the practice or quality of including or involving people from a range of different social and ethnic backgrounds and of different genders, sexual orientations, etc.” \\nThe definition gratuitously adds, “equality and diversity should be supported for their own sake.” \\nThe standard definition given for inclusion is involvement and empowerment where the inherent worth and dignity of all people are recognized. \\nYou say, “Williams, the military is an exception!” \\nWhat about language? \\nThe International Civil Aviation Organization has decreed that all air traffic controllers and flight crew members engaged in or in contact with international flights must be proficient in the English language as a general spoken medium. \\nAccording to the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, there are about 7,000 languages in the world. The International Civil Aviation Organization could promote language inclusiveness by requiring language rotation. \\nSome years, Cebuano (of the Malayo-Polynesian language family) and in other years Kinyarwanda (of the Niger-Congo language family) could be the language of pilots and air traffic controllers. \\nKeep in mind that it is claimed that the great benefit of diversity and inclusiveness is that it promotes and fosters a sense of belonging. It values and practices respect for the differences in the talents, beliefs, backgrounds, and ways of living of its members.\\nAnother issue is what should be done when people who should know better praise non-diversity and non-inclusiveness? \\nCivil rights leader Rev. Jesse L. Jackson said, “I applaud commissioner Adam Silver’s commitment to diversity and inclusion within the NBA.” \\nDuring the 2018-2019 season, more than 33% of NBA teams had head coaches of color. The number of assistant head coaches of color was over 42%. The number of black NBA players was 82%. \\nIn the face of these statistics, Oris Stuart, the NBA’s chief diversity and inclusion officer said, “Diversity, inclusion, and equality are central to every aspect of our game and our business.” \\nI would like for Jackson and others who claim that there’s racial diversity and inclusiveness in professional basketball to make their case. The same question can be asked about professional football where 70% of NFL players are black, and 9% of team head coaches are black. \\nThe thornier question and challenge is what can be done to make professional basketball and football look more like the American population?\\nMost of the diversity and inclusiveness insanity has its roots in academia. \\nAn example is a paper titled “Equilibrium Grade Inflation with Implications for Female Interest in STEM Majors,” written by Naval Postgraduate School professor Thomas Ahn, Duke University economics professor Peter Arcidiacono, Duke University researcher Amy Hopson, and James R. Thomas of the Federal Trade Commission.\\nThe authors argue that science, technology, engineering, and mathematics programs at colleges and universities lacking female enrollment can be attributed largely to harsh grading policies in these fields. \\nTheir solution to increase the number of women’s involvement in STEM is to standardize grading curves, in order to grade less “harshly.” The insanity of this approach is to not only weaken standards for women but to weaken standards across the board. \\nThis is more evidence that George Orwell was absolutely right when he said, “There are some ideas so absurd that only an intellectual could believe them.”\\nCOPYRIGHT 2020 CREATORS.COM',\n",
       " 'We’re back with a roundup of your emails, beginning with one on the state of public schools from a correspondent who recently moved from California to Virginia. Don’t forget to write us at [email\\xa0protected]—Ken McIntyre\\nDear Daily Signal: About your “Back to School Edition” roundup of reader comments: I served on a consultative diocesan school board in Southern California from 1999 to 2019. We moved to Virginia when our youngest was enrolled in a college in Michigan. I’ve stayed reasonably active in civic affairs. \\nWhile our kids were still in public\\nschools, first in Long Beach and then Newport Beach, California, the singular\\nthing that separated the two K-6 schools in each community was the\\npreponderance of “whole families” in Long Beach and mostly white, single-parent\\nfamilies in Newport Beach. \\nThe small Long Beach school allowed\\ninner-city kids to commute to the school if they came from a home with two parents.\\nIt was some sort of deal that had been arranged with the school district, and\\nthe imported students made the attendance numbers work and the little\\nneighborhood school viable. It was a wonderful school.\\nIn contrast was the K-6 school on\\nthe sand in Newport. Totally out of control, poorly administered. We stuck\\nthere for over a year and then bolted to a Catholic parish school on the advice\\nof some new friends. I eventually caught the attention of the LaSallian brother\\nwho served as superintendent, and was invited on his board.\\xa0\\nThe traditional model for Catholic\\nparish schools is 35 pupils in a class. That number floats the boat\\neconomically, and in schools throughout the country has been part of what\\nfilled the freshman classes at places such as University of Notre Dame and\\nGonzaga University. \\nWith all the babble in California about reduced class sizes in public schools, it didn’t take long for parents in the parish school to start voicing concern that 35 was just too many kids. There was an effect, and it wasn’t positive. \\nThe other matter was “credentialed”\\nteachers. I know of at least three persons at the parish school where our kids\\nattended who did not have a teaching credential. They were the most effective\\nteaching professionals I’ve ever met. \\nBut once that news spread to the\\nfamilies at the parish school, the die was cast. The teachers were released. \\nThere is another matter of\\n“formation” that goes missing in many Catholic schools these days. The teachers\\nare mostly formed\\xa0in the\\npublic university education programs. Need I go on?\\nWhere we live now in Virginia is the belly of the beast, so to speak. (Do you recognize the name Gavin Grimm?) Although the county is small (population 37,000), there are five K-6 schools, two middle schools, and one high school. The district enrollment is declining, but nonteaching staff is increasing. \\nAt public meetings, unionized\\nteachers rise to talk on the subject of salaries and pay increases. The\\ncomplaint is that they need more money in order to live. Throughout the county\\nare signs boasting “we’re hiring” and other messages to entice job seekers for\\npositions with businesses of varying size and type. \\nThe schools have some positions open\\neven while they concede falling enrollment. Recently there were 22 open\\npositions but only three were classroom instructors and one was a substitute. \\nThey have an entire K-6 campus that\\nused to be a segregated school, but is used now for various state and federally\\nfunded programs for students who have “special” needs and so on. It also\\nserves for the superintendent staff offices and district administrative offices\\nand the miscellany of a bureaucratic swamp. It has an amazingly full parking\\nlot.\\xa0\\nMany comments on The Daily Signal bemoan\\nthe struggle we’re having over the move toward socialism versus a free market\\neconomy. \\nAnyone thinking about homeschooling\\nneeds to attend a school board or board of supervisors meeting in my little\\ncorner of the world. Listen carefully to the bilge that angry teachers spew in\\nfavor of pay increases divorced from the product of their efforts: a learned\\npupil, honest and prepared to meet the challenges of a competitive society. \\nParents need to get their kids out of there.

Why is it that\\neveryone for some reason thinks it is the government’s responsibility to do\\neverything for someone?\\xa0\\nCivil\\ncommitments are a long and intensive process because the state is looking at\\nrestricting someone’s rights when he or she hasn’t committed any crime. It\\nshould be long and intensive. But allowing anyone to go to court to say someone\\nelse is a danger, and have a secret hearing, is where red flag laws fly in the\\nface of the Constitution, not only in terms of the Second Amendment but the\\nFourth, Fifth, and Sixth.\\nSwearer\\nreally thinks that the federal government will craft a law that is specific and\\nnarrow in scope? Come on, be realistic.\\xa0\\nSaying\\nred flag laws are dangerous but not a big deal for law enforcement since they\\nface dangerous things every day is really shortsighted.\\xa0\\nThe\\nauthor fails to mention that the man was killed by police when they arrived to\\nseize his guns without any due process.\\xa0That officer now has to live with\\nthe fact that he ended someone’s life. \\nAs\\na retired officer, I know the job is difficult enough without having to add\\nseizing guns from some unsuspecting person. There are already courts looking at\\nofficers being responsible for using force when needed if their actions pushed\\nthe situation.\\xa0\\nComing\\nto take someone’s guns is going to be an escalation of the situation. So are\\nthese laws going to give officers immunity for the force they may need to use? \\nAlready\\npeople complain about officers being too militarized. Well, when they are going\\nto have to go do a gun seizure they are going to need the SWAT team.

So thank you for all you do.\\nI live in Orange County, California,\\nwhich until recently was a bastion of conservative thinkers. I read The Orange\\nCounty Register for a portion of my daily news. While the Editorial Page staff\\nis mostly conservative in its views, I’m noticing a heavy bias in national news\\nstories presented in the paper.\\xa0 \\nIt appears that local new stories are\\ncovered by staff at the paper, but most or all national news stories are obtained\\nfrom the Associated Press. Time and time again, while reading news stories\\nabout significant national events, it appears that only one side to the story is\\npresented by the Associated Press.\\xa0 \\nJust this morning, I read an article on immigration titled “Trump:\\xa0Detain Children Longer.” There was not one quote or argument made in favor of the president’s position for taking this approach, even though I know there are arguments to be made.\\nWhy am I not getting both sides of the\\nstory from the Associated Press?\\xa0 Is this\\ncommon for a local paper to use the AP for all of its national news?\\nWhile I have heard plenty of examples of bias in network TV news and newspapers like The New York Times, I have never seen a story about the AP. Can someone please write about it? —Greg S. Johnstone, Ladera Ranch, Calif.\\n***\\nDear Daily Signal: The story of Canton, Mississippi, is certainly bad, but not the worst we face in the future (“There’s a Silver Lining to the Voter Fraud Scandal in Mississippi”).

       " 'The Congressional Budget Office projects that debt will rise to historically high levels, with no end in sight. (Photo: Prakasit Khuansuwan/EyeEm/Getty Images)\\n\\nJustin Bogie\\n/\\n@JustinBogie\\n\\nJustin Bogie is a senior policy analyst in fiscal affairs at The Heritage Foundation.\\nThe Congressional Budget Office has released its budget and economic projections for fiscal years 2020-2030. \\nThe latest report confirms what the Congressional Budget Office\\nhas been telling lawmakers for years: The nation is hurtling toward a spending-driven\\ndebt crisis. \\nWithout major reforms to mandatory spending programs, it is\\nnot a question of if, but when, all Americans will feel the financial impacts\\nof Congress’ spending addiction.\\nThe Congressional Budget Office projects the annual budget\\ndeficit will surpass $1 trillion (4.6% of gross domestic product) in fiscal\\nyear 2020 and rise to over $1.7 trillion annually by the end of the decade. Cumulative\\ndeficits will top $13.1 trillion from 2021 to 2030.\\nThe Congressional Budget Office also estimates that debt\\nheld by the public will rise to $17.9 trillion this year (80.8% of GDP) and to\\ntotal $31.4 trillion by the end of fiscal year 2030—nearly 100% of GDP.\\nTo be clear, the increase in projected deficit and debt\\nlevels is not a matter of the federal government taking in too little revenue. Revenues\\nare projected to keep rising from 16.4% of GDP in fiscal year 2020 to 18% of\\nGDP in 2030—higher than the 50-year average. \\nHowever, spending is set to rise from 21% of GDP in 2021 to 23.4%\\nof GDP over the next 10 years. That’s 3% above the historical average. \\nHere are five takeaways from the Congressional Budget Office’s budget and economic outlook:\\nAt the end of fiscal year 2019, debt held by the public rose to 79.2% of GDP. By 2030, debt held by the public is set to reach 98.3% of GDP.\\nAccording to Office of Management\\nand Budget data,\\nthe highest level of debt held by the public ever recorded in the U.S. was\\n106.1% of GDP in 1946—in the immediate aftermath of World War II.\\nIt is “unprecedented” for the country to be facing such high levels of debt in a time of relative peace and economic prosperity. \\nOver the next decade, the Congressional Budget Office estimates entitlement spending will rise by a combined 2.7% of GDP. Health care programs and Social Security are projected to consume 59% of all federal revenues by 2030. \\nBesides net interest payments, the\\nCongressional Budget Office projects all other areas of federal spending to\\ndecline as a percentage of GDP.\\nBoth Medicare and Social Security are\\nunsustainable in their current forms and on a path to insolvency. Congress\\nshould fundamentally reform these programs to lower costs and return control\\nover health care and retirement needs to the American people. \\nWithout action to slow the growth of entitlement spending, it will be nearly impossible to achieve a sustainable federal budget. \\nBy the end of this decade, the Congressional Budget Office estimates the federal government will spend $819 billion annually on interest payments on the national debt. That is more than double what the government spends on interest today and will amount to 10% of total projected spending in 2030.\\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates\\nthat in the next 10 years, the federal government will begin to spend more\\nmoney annually on debt service payments than it will on either Medicaid or the Disability\\nInsurance program. Interest costs would approach the level spent on national\\ndefense.\\nInterest payments on the debt are\\ncrowding out other national priorities. If debt continues to grow, interest\\npayments will further strain federal resources.\\nThe first step to reversing this trend is to ensure that lawmakers know the interest costs of legislation that comes before Congress. Under current scoring rules, interest payments are not included in cost estimates. Lawmakers should enact reforms requiring interest costs to be included in all Congressional Budget Office estimates, giving Congress a fuller picture of the impacts of its spending decisions. \\nBetween fiscal years 2020 and 2030, revenues are projected to rise by 2.6% of GDP. \\nSome will attribute rising revenues\\nto the expiration of the 2017 tax cuts. But revenues will continue to grow even\\nif the tax cuts are made permanent because Americans get wealthier over time,\\nmeaning more of our paychecks will be taxed at higher tax rates. \\nRising deficit and debt levels point to a spending problem. If Congress allows the tax cuts to expire, deficits will likely grow even faster than projected. Historically, tax increases are paired with increased spending, not deficit reductions. \\nProjected debt of nearly 100% of GDP should serve as a sobering warning to lawmakers. But if Congress ignores that warning, the Congressional Budget Office’s long-term projections get even more dire. \\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates\\nthat without reforms aimed at lowering the debt, debt held by the public will\\nrise to a projected 180% of GDP in just 30 years. The report warns that\\n“growing debt would dampen economic output over time” and “pose significant\\nrisks to the fiscal and economic outlook.”\\nThis could leave lawmakers with few options\\nother than significantly raising taxes on all Americans, meaning less\\nopportunity and economic prosperity for future generations.\\nThe Congressional Budget Office’s latest budget and economic\\noutlook reiterates that the current budget path is unsustainable. There is no\\ntime to waste. Congress should act now to implement reforms that will reduce\\nfederal spending and stabilize the national debt.\\nIf lawmakers fail to heed these warnings, all Americans will\\npay the price.

Send an email to Daniel.\\nThe Christmas season is here, which means the clock’s a-ticking to find the perfect gifts for your loved ones.\\nHere are 29 books that our friends at The Heritage Foundation think you and your family will enjoy.\\n1) “A Republic, If You Can Keep It” by Neil M. Gorsuch\\nIn a collection of speeches, judicial opinions, and anecdotes,\\nJustice Neil Gorsuch offers advice to legal and lay audiences alike on the\\nimportance of civility, courage, and humility in American society. Gorsuch\\noffers a rare glimpse into his private world, sharing poignant stories about\\nhis final moments of anonymity before being thrust onto the national stage with\\nhis nomination to the Supreme Court. He reveals how a neighbor helped him evade\\nreporters camped out near his home in the Colorado countryside and how he\\nenjoyed coloring pictures with a little girl on the plane ride to Washington\\nthat would change his life forever. While fans of Gorsuch will enjoy reading\\nhis speeches and opinions, it’s the brief piercing of the judicial veil that\\nleaves the reader wanting more. \\n—Elizabeth Slattery is a legal fellow in The Heritage Foundation’s Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies and host of “SCOTUS 101,“ a podcast about the Supreme Court.\\n2) “The Unholy Trinity: Blocking the Left’s Assault on Life, Marriage, and Gender” by Matt Walsh\\nThe fabric of American culture that was once deeply rooted\\nin fundamental biblical principles is rapidly unravelling at a pace that many\\nconservatives often don’t recognize. Matt Walsh does not mince words when it\\ncomes to calling out the dangers of the left’s three key social battlegrounds\\nof redefining life, marriage, and gender. He argues that if progressivism can\\nreshape the meanings of gender, family, and life to its own desire, it has\\nestablished relativism over God as the supreme law and now holds the power to\\ndestroy Western civilization.\\xa0\\n—Thaleigha Rampersad is a production specialist at The Heritage\\nFoundation.\\n3) “Open Borders: The Science and Ethics of Immigration” by Bryan Caplan and Zach Weinersmith\\nIn this book, Bryan Caplan and Zach Weinersmith produce an\\nincredibly thoughtful book on one of the most critical policy issues of the\\nday. It should be read by anyone who is at all interested in immigration policy,\\nregardless of what one currently thinks about open borders. \\n—Paul Winfree serves as\\ndirector of the Thomas A. Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies at The\\nHeritage Foundation.\\n4) “A History (and Future) of the Budget Process in the United States: Budget by Fire” by Paul Winfree\\nJoin Paul Winfree for a fun romp through the exciting\\nhistory of America’s federal budget process.\\xa0OK, maybe not a “fun romp,”\\nbut definitely an educational and entertaining excursion.\\xa0Informed by his\\nexperience on Capitol Hill and at the White House, Paul brings a truly unique\\nperspective to explaining how the seemingly arcane federal budget process\\nactually lies at the center of nearly every major governing decision throughout\\nthe nation’s history.\\xa0In the end, Paul teaches us what we already kind of\\nknew: The men and women who built and governed this nation never really knew\\nexactly what they were doing.\\xa0But by hook or by crook, driven by\\nprinciple, a little politics, and maybe a skosh of luck, they somehow succeeded\\nin building (and funding) a pretty amazing place. \\n—Jack Spencer is vice\\npresident of the Institute for Economic Freedom and Opportunity at The Heritage\\nFoundation.\\n5) “Political Visions and Illusions: A Survey and Christian Critique of Contemporary Ideologies” by David Koyzis\\n“There’s often a grain of truth in a lie.” We hear that saying in everyday life, but it’s a deeply true insight when applied to political thought, as David Koyzis shows in his winsome and accessible book. Liberalism, nationalism, socialism—each of these contain something of the truth, even if they’re ultimately wrong. How can that be? As a Christian, Koyzis points to Scripture, which teaches that God created all things good. The problem in life, and in politics, is that we’re prone to pick one good thing out of creation and ascribe ultimacy to it, putting it in the place of God. For liberals, that means giving ultimate value to the individual. For democrats, the voice of the collective people is ultimate. For socialists, material equality is ultimate. Koyzis argues that each of these political ideologies (and others) are a form of idolatry that, at root, are deeply religious—no matter how secular they may claim to be. His solution is to stop elevating one aspect of reality over others, and instead to find order in all that God has created.\\nKoyzis’ book offers Christians a helpful and salient way to assess political ideologies. For the non-believer, it shows how biblical truths make sense of the politically charged world we find ourselves in.\\n—Daniel Davis is the commentary editor of The Daily Signal and co-host of The Daily Signal Podcast.\\n6)\\xa0“Letters to the Church” by Francis Chan\\nThe early Church, as described throughout the book of Acts,\\nwas called to be an unstoppable force in a broken world looking for answers,\\nand hope that could only be found in a life following Christ. Francis Chan\\nreminds readers of these fundamental principles that marked the Church at its\\ninception. He challenges believers to risk it all for God’s mission in the\\nworld and passionately pursue His vision for the Church, and to transform their\\nSunday attendance from what’s often become a mundane ritual to a genuine\\nspiritual encounter with the one true God. \\n—Thaleigha Rampersad is a production specialist at The Heritage\\nFoundation.\\n7) “You are Worth It: Building a Life Worth Fighting For” by Kyle Carpenter\\nKyle Carpenter’s book is an insightful reflection on living\\nfor others. Carpenter, the youngest living Medal of Honor recipient, shares his\\nstory from childhood through his fateful moment during a deployment in\\nAfghanistan when he threw himself on a grenade to protect his unit. Despite his\\nsignificant injuries, Carpenter explains how he had to choose to accept his\\ndisabilities with humor and humility in order to use his story to support\\nothers going through challenges. \\nA particularly poignant moment that provided the name of the\\nbook came from a conversation with his Uber driver, an immigrant who was\\nprofoundly grateful for the opportunity to be an American. After being thanked\\nfor his service, Carpenter without thinking replied, “You are worth it.” One of\\nthe most inspiring takeaways from the book is that we are all given the chance\\nto be someone else’s miracle as we go about our daily lives, something that\\nCarpenter sees as his new mission after leaving the Marines. \\n—Abby Bird is the\\nrecruitment and training coordinator at The Heritage Foundation.\\n8) “When Breath Becomes Air” by Paul Kalanithi\\nThis paradigm-shifting book was recommended to me by Heritage colleague Joshua Meservey. An auto-biography, “When Breath Becomes Air” drops you into the life of up-and-coming neurosurgeon Paul Kalanithi, who receives an unexpected diagnosis of terminal cancer in his early 30s. It takes you on a journey exploring the meaning of life and death as Kalanithi grapples with these concepts during his final days. The book is simultaneously about the eternal and the present, and its beautiful prose calls you to contemplate the meaning of your own life and death. Easily in my top three books I’ve ever read.\\n—Olivia Enos is a senior\\npolicy analyst in the Asian Studies Center at The Heritage Foundation.\\n9) “The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York” by Robert A. Caro\\nThis Pulitzer Prize-winning biography shows not just how one\\nman corrupted New York, but how pervasive corruption can be hidden from the\\npublic—even in America. Caro’s legendary, meticulous research shows the reader\\nhow power works in America and proves that our perceptions of power can be\\ndisastrously wrong. Robert Moses, for example, built public works that were\\nadored by the masses on an unparalleled scale (many are still in use today),\\nmaking himself the most popular man in New York in the process. However, his\\nstrong arm methods and explicitly racist philosophy broke New York City’s\\ngovernment and infrastructure for generations to come. \\nThis in-depth history classic reads like a novel. He leads\\nthe reader to hope that “maybe they can stop him this time,” only to see him\\ntime after time subvert the checks and balances of liberty in the most creative\\nways. Caro’s conversational style guides the average reader through complex\\npolitical issues at a very accessible level. A must-read for any American who\\nthinks they would know if their government was hijacked.\\n—Patrick Hulehan is a senior accountant at The Heritage Foundation.\\n10) “Storm of Steel” by Ernst Jünger\\nThis book is about soldiering, plain and simple. First published in German in 1920, and later translated into English, this is a story about trench warfare in World War I as told by a plucky young German soldier. Jünger does not delve into the complex origins or political circumstances that led to the outbreak of war. If he held any political views about the Kaiser or the conduct of the war, he does not share them. If that’s what you are looking for, then this book is not for you. If you’re looking for a raw account of what it was like to fight as a young man (wounded seven times) on the losing side of one of the deadliest conflicts in human history, this is your book. \\n—Luke Coffey\\nis the director of the Allison Center for Foreign Policy Studies at The\\nHeritage Foundation.\\n11) “Miles Gone By: A Literary Autobiography” by William F. Buckley Jr.\\nBuckley offers a selection of previously published writings\\nthat limn “a narrative story of my life, at work and play.” The pieces reveal\\nwhat matters most to the founder of the modern American conservative\\nmovement—family, friends, and his travels on land and sea. \\n—Lee Edwards is the\\ndistinguished fellow in conservative thought at The Heritage Foundation’s B.\\nKenneth Simon Center for Principles and Politics.\\n12) “Why Soldiers Miss War: The Journey Home” by Nolan Peterson\\nI was first introduced to Nolan Peterson in 2015 and soon realized his tremendous talents as a writer and war journalist when we hired him as The Daily Signal’s first foreign correspondent. What I came to learn later was his rich history as a combat veteran. In his latest book, Peterson draws from his own experience as a U.S. Air Force special operations pilot in Afghanistan and Iraq to explore the lasting effects of war and the challenges of coming home.\\n—Rob Bluey is executive\\neditor of The Daily Signal.\\n13) “Leaving Cloud 9” by Ericka Andersen\\nIf you enjoy memoirs, you’ll love the heartbreaking story in\\n“Leaving Cloud 9” of a boy who grew up amid abuse and poverty—ultimately\\novercoming his past through a transformational relationship with God. After\\njoining the Army at 18, suffering through PTSD, divorce, and extreme\\ndepression, Rick was at rock bottom. Meeting his wife led him through church\\ndoors he had long abandoned. This book has been compared to “Hillbilly Elegy”\\nand lives up to the name. You’ll walk away recognizing that the power of God\\nand individual influences in our lives are far more powerful than any\\ngovernment policy. A truly incredible story of redemption.\\n—Michelle Cordero is the digital\\ncontent manager for The Heritage Foundation.\\n14) “Option\\nB: Facing Adversity, Building Resilience, and Finding Joy” by Sheryl Sandberg and Adam Grant\\n“Option B” combines the story of a\\xa0real-life tragedy,\\nexperienced by tech executive Sheryl Sandberg, with insights by psychologist\\nAdam Grant to help people through grief and onto a path to healing and\\nthriving. It’s a tremendously moving and inspiring book that will be\\nparticularly valuable for those suffering from loss and the people that\\nsurround them. Whether you’re the person who is in pain or are trying to help a\\nfamily member, a friend, or a colleague who is experiencing grief, “Option B”\\nis an invaluable guide for living through pain and building resilience to find\\njoy again.\\n—Romina Boccia is the director of the Grover M. Hermann Center for the Federal Budget at The Heritage Foundation. \\n15) “The Only Plane in the Sky: An Oral History of 9/11” by Garrett M. Graff\\nIt’s often been said that there isn’t a New Yorker that\\ndoesn’t have a Sept. 11 story. This book pieces together some of the most\\npoignant ones interspersed with the stories from some of the key players of the\\nBush administration who were with the president on the day time stood still for\\nthe nation. Whether you pick up an audio version (which has powerful playback\\nfrom voicemails left for loved ones from passengers on the planes before they\\ncrashed) or purchase the hard cover copy, Graff places you directly into the\\nshoes of people who were affected by the events of Sept. 11, 2001.\\xa0\\nOnce Air Traffic Control and the country’s leadership\\nunderstood the grave danger of the events that were unfolding, all planes\\nacross the country were grounded until further notice—except one, Air Force\\nOne. Some of the most moving testimonies are from members of the Bush\\nadministration and the fastidious notes they took on the day of the attacks.\\nRecognizing that they may have had one of the most unique and interesting\\npoints of view from that day, the stories they tell are ones so often not heard,\\nbut so pivotal in the scheme of history.\\xa0\\n—Thaleigha Rampersad is a production specialist at The Heritage\\nFoundation.\\n16) “The Great Partnership” by Christian B. Keller\\nYou don’t have to be a Civil War buff to find this book\\ninteresting. Sure, it’s filled with historical details from several key Civil\\nWar battles, but they’re all in the service of showing how the partnership\\nbetween Robert E. Lee and Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson developed, and why it\\nproduced a string of military wins that stunned the pre-Gettysburg Union\\nArmy—victories that are studied to this day. \\nSo while Keller’s book will probably prove most appealing to\\nthose who love history, it’s also valuable for those trying to learn more about\\nleadership and how to forge an effective team—in war, yes, but also in sports\\nor business. Drawn from numerous primary sources, it can help just about anyone\\nlooking for insights into what makes a partnership work, offering lessons that\\ncan help readers in any field.\\n—Paul Gallagher is manager\\nof editorial services at The Heritage Foundation.\\n17) “Hymns of the Republic: The Story of the Final Year of the American Civil War” by S. C. Gwynne\\nIn Gwynne’s third historical volume, he tackles a critically\\nimportant but seldom reviewed chapter of American History. He follows the Civil\\nWar and its major characters from Ulysses S. Grant’s ascension as Abraham Lincoln’s\\ntop general through the aftermath of the president’s assassination. This is a\\nstirring, beautifully written book that will give each reader an appreciation\\nfor the narrative and significance of the war’s final year. Gwynne carries you\\nthrough the military, political, and personal dynamics that finally reunited\\nour nation.\\xa0\\n—Raz\\nShafer is senior assistant to the president for donor relations at The\\nHeritage Foundation.\\n18) “Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup” by John Carreyrou\\nElizabeth Holmes was the founder of Theranos, a Silicon Valley startup that promised to revolutionize medical treatment. Theranos said they had developed a printer-sized device that could carry out blood tests using only tiny samples. It would enable more people to identify potentially fatal diseases in their earliest stages, saving countless lives. Holmes visualized one in the home of every American. \\nThe concept was a sensation, and Theranos regarded as potentially the Apple of health care (a dream for Holmes, who was so obsessed with Steve Jobs she would dress like him and attempt to speak in his tone of voice). Holmes herself was a rising superstar who titans of the business and political world were scrambling to work with, including Gen. James Mattis, Henry Kissinger, and George Shultz. At its peak, Theranos was worth $9 billion.\\nThere was, however, a catch. Theranos’ technology didn’t work. It was all a con. \\nHolmes is today awaiting trial on two charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and nine counts of wire fraud. She faces up to 20 years in jail. “Bad Blood” explains how she went from being the darling of Silicon Valley to the disgrace of it. The ugly, full extent of Holmes’ megalomania, her attempts to conceal the scale of her deception, and the damage she did to all those in her orbit, are thrillingly laid out in a tale steeped with ambition, paranoia, and obsession.\\n—Robin Simcox is the\\nMargaret Thatcher Fellow at The Heritage Foundation.\\n19) “The British Are Coming” by Rick Atkinson\\nHistory buffs will remember Atkinson as the author of the critically acclaimed Liberation Trilogy describing the liberation of Europe in World War II, a volume that won the Pulitzer Prize.\\xa0Atkinson, a former journalist, has embarked on a new enterprise, the Revolution Trilogy.

Frank said,\\n“Despite everything, I believe that people are really good at heart.”\\n\\nThe Newsweek headline, “Conservative Radio Host\\nRidicules Anne Frank,” was simply a lie. In order for readers to\\nappreciate the level of mendacity, I had my entire response transcribed and\\nplaced it in the column.\\nA few days later I received a message from Nancy Cooper,\\nglobal editor-in-chief of Newsweek. She emailed me her personal cellphone\\nnumber and asked me to call her. I did, and we had a good conversation. She\\nagreed that what Newsweek published mischaracterized my remarks and corrected\\nboth the headline and the article, written by deputy editor Benjamin Fearnow.\\nShe changed the headline to “Conservative Radio Host\\nCounters Anne Frank’s View That People Are ‘Good at Heart.'”\\nIn addition, she deleted Fearnow’s sentence characterizing\\nme as having mocked Anne Frank. And she deleted another Fearnow falsehood: “He\\nalso brings up Nazi comparisons frequently on his radio program, “The Dennis\\nPrager Show,” to criticize modern Democrats and liberals.”\\nI told Cooper that in 37 years of radio, I have never\\ncompared Democrats or liberals to Nazis; Fearnow had made that up out of whole\\ncloth. \\nIn its place, she wrote the truth: “He also brings up Nazi comparisons on his radio program, ‘The Dennis Prager Show,’ saying the left ‘cheapens’ Nazi evil by using the term to dismiss political opponents or that liberals focus on Nazism while failing to acknowledge the horrors wrought by Communism.”\\nThe following notice now appears at the end of the article:\\n“Update 1/8, 4:45 p.m. ET: The original headline on this story\\nmisrepresented Prager’s comments; the headline and story have been edited to\\nreflect that Prager did not ‘ridicule’ or ‘mock’ Anne Frank but took issue with\\nher view.”\\nAs I wrote to Cooper, “Your attention to this says a\\nlot about you and your hopes for Newsweek. Thank you.”\\nBut the story doesn’t end there.\\nFirst, has Newsweek disciplined Fearnow in any way? (I never\\nheard from Fearnow.)\\nSecond, and more important, the original lie about me has\\ntaken on a life of its own. It was conveyed on numerous left-wing sites.\\nWonkette, under the sarcastic headline “Dennis Prager Will Not Be Bullied by Anne Frank,” wrote a deceit-filled article about my comments about Anne Frank.

But what’s the government’s role here? Is it making things worse? And if so, what’s the solution? Richard Vedder, author of  “Restoring the Promise: Higher Education in America” shares his thoughts. Read the interview, posted below, or listen on the podcast: \\nWe also cover these stories:\\nThe Daily Signal podcast is available on\\xa0Ricochet,\\xa0iTunes,\\xa0SoundCloud,\\xa0Google Play, or\\xa0Stitcher.

He is senior fellow at the Independent Institute and author of the book “Restoring the Promise: Higher Education in America.” \\nMr. Vedder, thank you for joining us.\\nRichard Vedder: Delighted to be with you, Daniel.\\nDavis: So, lots of younger folks, in my generation and younger, are saddled with student debt and I want to ask you about that. \\nWe often think of student federal aid as a good thing, something that helps us afford college, but you write in your book that government aid actually contributes to the problem. Can you explain that for us?\\nVedder: Sure. When they started the student loan programs around 1970, and they grew very large in the late ’70s, an extension of the Student Loan Act provided this money. \\nWhen this happened, colleges said, “Aha! Kids are going to be able to afford college more than before, so we can be more aggressive in raising our fees.” \\nSo colleges, starting in the late ’70s, started to raise their fees. They used to go up a little bit more than the inflation rate, maybe 1% more a year than the inflation rate. Now they started going up far faster, 3% or more faster than the inflation rate. \\nAnd if you compound that over 40 years, which is the amount of time that has passed since then, … kids are now paying about double the tuition fees they would’ve paid if that had not happened.\\nSo the tuition fees in America have been pushed up by the student loan programs. I think Bill Bennett, who was secretary of education, wrote a op-ed in The New York Times, of all places, in 1987 where he made that point. \\nAnd a lot of people poo-pooed it and said, “Ah, that’s not true.” But the research from the New York Fed and the National Bureau of Economic Research has validated what Bill Bennett said.\\nDavis: Wow. So would you say government intervention really is the key driver, the main driver of tuition these days? We see tuition every year going up.\\nVedder: It has been. Now, in fairness, in a lot of recent developments, tuition fees are starting to rise less rapidly and schools are desperate because enrollments have been falling. \\nFees went up so much that college became prohibitively expensive for some people, particularly low-income people [who] saw these massive sticker prices and they just didn’t apply in some cases to college. \\nSo the irony of it is we put in student loans to help mostly low-income people, supposedly, and the reality is the low-income people have been scared away from college more than the affluent, middle-income or upper-income people. \\nI call this the law of unintended consequences. Things turned out to be just the opposite of what the government intended.\\nDavis: Do you think there’s any hope of reversing that with federal policy?\\nVedder: It’s going to be tough because our vested interests are always going to fight change. If we did things right, we would start reversing that and we can whittle away at it. \\nWe can limit student loans, the number of years you could borrow, we could limit it to only undergraduate education and not expensive graduate education. We can cut out something called Plus loans, which are loans often made to parents of students. \\nWe could also make the loans more on a commercial basis, that is you don’t get the money unless there’s some reasonable prospect that you’re going to graduate. You got to have a minimal academic status. \\nThere are a lot of things we could do to improve the system, but we need to start doing those things.\\nDavis: I want to ask you also about the issue of free speech on campus, which is increasingly an issue that even the president has addressed. \\nBack in the ’60s, the sort of young, new left on campus were championing free speech. And speculate as to why, I mean, it certainly helped their voice. But now that they have a monopoly on the university, it seems that they’re more in favor of shutting it down. \\nJust historically, I’m curious about when this started. When did free speech really start getting shut down on campuses? Is this a recent phenomenon?\\nVedder: You could argue that free speech has been closed down on campuses since the 15th, 16th century. Galileo wasn’t allowed to say what he wanted to say and faced the consequences. But when the Enlightenment came in the 18th century, the idea is that free speech is liberating. It improves the mind, it improves the economy, and so forth. \\nAnd we had the classical liberal revolution that is what made us what we are today as a nation and planet, really, a wealthy and prosperous place. All that started way back then and then we were getting rid of barriers to free speech, the ideas enhancing free speech.\\n … We had, in the 1950s, some restriction on free speech, but in what was called the McCarthy era, where Sen. [Joseph] McCarthy, who was … most people would say was a conservative Republican, but I don’t look at that in quite that way, he was fiercely anti-Communist. And we had loyalty oaths that some professors had to sign in order to have jobs as teaching and so on. \\nSo we’ve had episodes in American history where government has interfered with the process of education to impose certain restrictions.\\nThat’s coming back again, it’s not so much the government, it’s … well, in some sense, the government is enforcing it, I think, because diversity of ideas is not part of the agenda of the welfare state. And indeed, the agenda the welfare state seems almost to be the opposite. \\nWe all have to think alike because there is a progressive way of thinking and that problem has grown, I think gradually, since the ’80s and the ’90s, but it is certainly reached a crescendo level in the last decade or so.\\nBut again, if the federal government weren’t in the higher ed business at all, which essentially they weren’t before 1960 or ’65, I don’t think we would be having these problems. Or at least we wouldn’t have them at the level of severity that we do. Because colleges were competing for students without subsidies from the government. \\nThere are consequences when you turn people off and a lot of these protests have turned people off.\\nLook at Evergreen State in the state of Washington where they went wild with protests and, at one time, were even telling certain students, white students, that they couldn’t go to campus. And what’s happened there, dramatic decline in enrollments and so forth.\\nI think the American people, by and large, have a different set of values with respect to these things than is prevailing in the collegiate communities. \\nSchools like Yale get away with murder in this regard because for one thing, they have huge endowments so no matter what they do, they’re insulated from the market. And we need to let market forces work more and the biggest single thing that would help that is for the government to get out of the higher education business.\\nDavis: Yeah. I saw a few years ago … the Mizzou controversy with the professor getting fired because she was involved in the physical confrontation. I mean, they saw a drop-off of students.\\nVedder: Dramatic at Missouri. Several thousand, they’ve had to let go a number of faculty members and what not. \\nThe irony of it is, a secondary effect is appropriations on the part of the state government from the university have fallen significantly because the legislators are fed up with this. And rightfully so, I might add, in this case.\\nSo protesting is costly to universities, but they feel they have to allow [it] because they’re being intimidated by a small group of students. Sometimes not so small, sometimes medium-sized group of students on some of these campuses. \\nIt’s time that we stand up to this and one way to do it is to threaten the removal of federal funds. President Trump intimated as much in his recent executive order.\\nDavis: Last question I just want to ask you. … Some members of Congress [are] talking about how … they’ve kind of been turned off by the way that universities have gone and are saying that college isn’t for everyone, it’s not as good as it’s cooked up to be, we need to consider trade schools, look at those. \\nI think a lot of conservatives are interested in that because it would break up the monopoly that, among other things, is indoctrinating a new generation of people. \\nSo with that, with the college costs, and everything that goes into a four-year university, do you think it’s still worth it for young people to attend the four-year college?\\nVedder: There are some people that benefit from a four-year college and will continue. There are things that colleges do that some people will benefit from. \\nPart of it is vocational, they’ll develop credentials that make them look good to law schools and look good to employers and so forth. And so there are some students, some people for whom this is true. \\nBut there’s a large group of students for whom this is not true or who drop out or fail. Forty percent of the kids drop-out, another 40% graduate and they end up doing jobs like being a barista or working in a Walmart or a Home Depot or something like that. So the risk of going is rising. The risk of going to college.\\nSo is it less risky to be trained to be a welder or a plumber? Yes. Even there you can fail, but if you fail, the consequences are not as great. You don’t have four years of schooling, you have less money involved.\\nDavis: You make a lot more money welding.\\nVedder: And you make more money welding. \\nSo I generally wish [for] government [to] get out of the education business. But if you’re going to be in the education business, I think it would be smart to turn some of our resources away from the traditional universities toward these kind of programs. \\nVocational education, which, by the way, 50, 75 years ago, we did have a more vibrant vocational education program in America and we got away from that because we told everyone, “College is for all. You have to go to college.” That was very bad advice and we’re reaping the consequences of it now.\\nDavis: Well, the book is called “Restoring the Promise: Higher Education in America.” Richard Vedder, really appreciate your time.\\nVedder: Thanks.',\n",

I helped organize a large group of black pastors to come to Washington from around the country and demonstrate support for him.\\nWhen Branch Rickey, president and general manager of the then-Brooklyn Dodgers, recruited Jackie Robinson to be the first black player in Major League Baseball, Rickey warned Robinson that he would be challenged to focus on the game and not react to the racist jeers that would come—not just from the stands, but from his own white teammates.\\n“They’ll taunt you and goad you,” Rickey warned. “They’ll do anything to make you react. They’ll try to provoke a race riot in the ballpark.”\\nClarence Thomas had to stand the same test.\\nExcept this time, it was not whites trying to drive a black man off the field. It was liberals—black liberals and white liberals—trying to drive a black conservative off the field.\\nThomas describes what he had to endure: “[Y]ou’re not really black, because you’re not doing what we expect black people to do.”\\nAnd with regard to what the left was trying to achieve with Hill, he said: “People should just tell the truth: ‘This is the wrong black guy. He has to be destroyed.’”\\nThat circles back to Thomas’ similarities with Robinson. Both men drew their strength from their deep faith to stand with integrity in the face of merciless attacks.\\nThomas talks about the restoration of his Catholicism after his youthful rebellion and black radicalism: “I asked God, ‘If you take anger out of my heart, I’ll never hate again.’”\\nAnger and hate are just other forms of slavery. Other people are controlling you.\\nThomas became a free man once his faith was restored.\\nThomas is now the most senior justice on the Supreme Court and has become one of America’s great conservative elder statesmen. His opinions over the years already have created a legacy of finely and rigorously reasoned jurisprudence, faithful to the core principles on which America was founded.\\nWhen Thomas was sworn in—after enduring what no man or woman should have to endure in his confirmation hearings—he alluded in his speech to Psalm 30, which reads: “I will praise you, Lord, for you have rescued me. You refused to let my enemies triumph over me. … Weeping may go on all night, but joy comes with the morning.”\\nWhat better way to pay tribute to America and black history than going to see this important new film?\\nCOPYRIGHT 2020 CREATORS.COM',\n",

He’s the deputy director of the Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies and senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation. He is also the author of a new Heritage Foundation report, “The 1972 Equal Rights Amendment Can No Longer Be Ratified—Because It No Longer Exists.” Tom, thank you so much for being with us today.\\nJipping: Thanks for having me.\\ndel Guidice: So on Monday, Virginia passed the Equal Rights Amendment, or the ERA. Before we get started, can you just kind of briefly go over what the ERA is?\\nJipping: Sure. The Equal Rights Amendment is a proposed amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The effort to make it part of the Constitution has been going on since the 1920s, and proposals to send it to the states have been introduced in Congress more than a thousand times over those years. \\nIt got the two-thirds vote of both houses of Congress that the Constitution requires only once and that was in 1972, and that sent the ERA to the states. The Constitution requires that three-quarters of the states must ratify an amendment before it becomes part of the Constitution. \\nIn terms of what the ERA says, the version that was sent to the states in 1972 is very short. It simply says that that rights shall not be denied based on sex. And it was increasingly controversial when it was proposed in the 1970s, a lot of states ratified it quite quickly, and then that progress slowed dramatically as different organizations really urged state legislatures to examine not just the words of it, which sound pretty simple, but what it could be used to do.\\nAs a result, a total of 35 states ratified it by the deadline. It did have a seven-year deadline when it was proposed, so that deadline would have been in March of 1979. And then Congress extended it once to June 30, 1982. And when that deadline passed and there weren’t three-quarters of the states on board, the ERA effectively died. \\nThe reason we’re talking about it today is that after about kind of 20-25 years of just sort of sitting there, some ERA activists and some feminist organizations started thinking a little more creatively, if they could get the progress going, could they pick up where they left off back in 1982? \\nAnd some made the argument that states could still ratify the 1972 ERA and if they had three more states, that would get them to 38, that was three-quarters, and bingo, it would happen.\\nSo, Nevada ratified in 2017, Illinois ratified in 2018, and now Virginia claims to be the 38th state to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment. \\nIn my paper, I explain what really is a pretty commonsense idea. The deadline was a deadline, June 30, 1982. After that date, the ERA no longer existed. It wasn’t pending before the states anymore. So, whatever it is that Virginia says that it did, you can’t ratify a constitutional amendment that doesn’t exist. \\nIf activists want the ERA be part of the Constitution, they’re going to have to start over again. They’re going to have to get Congress to propose it again and get it to the states for ratification. But the 1972 ERA is dead.\\ndel Guidice: So proponents of the ERA, a local Richmond news station had said that these people are saying that the amendment will enshrine equality for women in the Constitution. Would you say, knowing what the ERA is, is that the case?\\nJipping: As I said, the debate about what the ERA would or wouldn’t do, either intended or unintended consequences, has been going on since literally the 1920s. \\nIn the very beginning, believe it or not, feminist groups and labor unions strongly opposed the ERA because they said it could be used to prevent legislation that would actually benefit women. Today, those roles are reversed, but there’s a lot of discussion and has been since it was proposed in 1972 about how much mischief it could actually be used for.\\n … This goes to your question as well, the other debate is whether existing law, either provisions of the Constitution, state constitutions, many states have passed their own ERAs, whether those laws that are in place today, that certainly weren’t in place in the 1970s, provide the legal protection that women need. \\nThere’s certainly debates about those questions. I do think that the threat or the possibility that something even as simple as the ERA could be used, especially in the courts, for all kinds of other things. I think that danger is much more real today even than it was in 1972.\\nWe see all the time groups going to the courts with a Constitution that says one thing and they persuade judges that it says something else. And we end up changing the country in profound ways that were never intended. And I think whether it’s abortion, the LGBT agenda, all sorts of things that would very definitely be on the litigation agenda, should the ERA become part of the Constitution.\\ndel Guidice: You touched on this a bit earlier, but to drill down into it a little bit more, Virginia is claiming, as you mentioned, to be the 38th state to pass the ERA. So does that mean that it’s now a constitutional amendment? You hinted on this, but just to clarify for everyone listening.\\nJipping: The process, and this is laid out by a federal statute, once a state does what Virginia did, it sends what the statute calls ratifying documents to the Office of the Federal Register—that’s an agency here in Washington that publishes the federal register, which is a record of regulations. \\nOnce the Office of Federal Register has received those documents from 38 states, they notify the archivist of the United States and then the archivist does a review of those documents for what the statute calls legal sufficiency. Basically just to make sure that they’re legally sound. \\nAnd then if there are 38 states’ ratifications that are legally sound, it becomes part of the Constitution. Congress has no role, they don’t have to take any vote. The president isn’t involved.\\nSo the question is, if the ERA expired in 1982, if it literally was not available for ratification, when these documents get here to Washington and the archivist does his review, what’s he going to say? Can he say that ratification of a amendment that doesn’t exist is legally sound? I don’t think so. But that’s the process that is spelled out in federal statute. \\nAnd I suppose almost everything ends up in court at some point in this country. So, I suppose at some point thereafter there might be a lawsuit. But that’s what has to happen next.\\ndel Guidice: Five states tried to take back their support of the ERA. Can a state do that?\\nJipping: Well, that’s an important part of the ERA story. As I said, the effort to get states to ratify the ERA really took off in 1972, and a couple of dozen states very quickly ratified it. Not only did the pace of new states dwindle, but because of the rapidly increasing opposition, as you said, five of the states that did ratify, they rescinded that ratification.I believe those rescissions are valid. \\nIn other words, until 38 states ratify the amendment, it’s not an amendment. It’s not part of the Constitution. It’s still pending. And a state can make its decision, they can change their mind, they can do one thing one year and five years later, undo it if they want. Until that ratification deadline happens, the amendment is pending and as long as it’s pending, states can do what they want to do.\\nIn my opinion, by the deadline, by the 1982 deadline, only 30 states had validly ratified the ERA and they would’ve needed eight more. But my dad said close count only counts in tiddlywinks or horseshoes or something and 35 is just as far away from 38 as 30 is. Either way, the ERA is dead.\\ndel Guidice: In 2019, there was a House committee that passed a bill that would have removed the 1982 deadline for the ERA. So could the Senate and House, hypothetically speaking, retroactively remove that 1982 deadline and let the Equal Rights Amendment move forth?\\nJipping: No. As I said, June 30, 1982, the ERA is dead. Congress cannot amend a bill that has failed. That would be like introducing an amendment today to a bill that was introduced three years ago or something like that. It doesn’t exist. A deadline is a deadline. \\nThe Constitution gives Congress a significant authority to propose constitutional amendments and the Supreme Court has held clearly that that includes the authority to set a deadline. Congress did that. The deadline is passed. Everyone knows what a deadline is. The deadline has passed. As frustrating as that might be to some political activists, as much as people might wish that hadn’t happened, it did.\\nThe Congressional Research Service, which, as I’m sure you know, is a well-respected, widely used resource of nonpartisan research—when I worked in the United States Senate, we relied on them frequently—they’ve published a huge work about the Constitution and its interpretation. I mean, it’s literally almost 3,000 pages long, covering every subject imaginable. \\nAnd for more than 20 years, the Congressional Research Service has said that on June 30, 1982, the ERA died. We can make, and lawyers can make, any subject really complicated no matter how simple it is, but that’s the deadline. It passed. The ERA is dead.\\ndel Guidice: So you have people celebrating it even still, even though we have this deadline that has passed, and if these advocates still wanted to go about and actually do this the right way, how would they go about doing that? Would they reintroduce it? What are the steps to that?\\nJipping: The process is the same as they did for the 1972 ERA. A member of Congress would introduce a joint resolution that includes a deadline, if there is one. It designates whether states must ratify the amendment by legislature or convention. And then it includes the language of the amendment. \\nIf two-thirds of Congress pass that, it gets sent to the states, three-fourths of the states ratify it, it becomes part of the Constitution. So that process has to start over. \\nAs I said, since the ’20s, those resolutions to propose the ERA have been introduced over a thousand times. Everybody knows that that’s the process and that if it doesn’t work the first time, you do it again, you start over.\\nAs I say, I realize that’s frustrating. With the opposition to the original ERA there’d probably be more opposition now, and so the likelihood that it would become part of the Constitution is probably lower. \\nI can see where they would want to grasp whatever strategy they thought could give them a leg up on that, but this isn’t it. The deadline passed 37 years ago.\\ndel Guidice: Earlier this week, Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring said per American University Radio, “I am committed as ever to making sure we have and use every single tool at our disposal to make sure the Equal Rights Amendment becomes part of the United States Constitution.” So in his role as Virginia attorney general, is there anything he can do to achieve that?\\nJipping: You’ll notice that he didn’t say anything specific about whether the 1972 ERA has in fact been ratified by Virginia. Interestingly, in 1994, the deputy attorney general of Virginia issued an opinion saying specifically, he was responding to a member of the legislature that the ERA was no longer pending and could not be ratified. That was 25 years ago. \\nSo Attorney General Herring I’m not aware has reversed that. What he’s saying is he wants to see the ERA become part of the Constitution. Lots of people do, and there’s a process for that.\\ndel Guidice: Alabama, South Dakota, and Louisiana, they’re suing the head archivist of United States saying that it would be illegal to add the ERA as an amendment. What’s your perspective on that suit and where do you think it will go?\\nJipping: As I mentioned about the process, the archivist is sort of the final step of the process. He has to make that review to make sure that the documents he’s received from at least 38 states are legally sound. He hasn’t done that yet, he hasn’t made any decision on that yet. So the lawsuit is probably a little premature, but they’re focusing it in the right place. \\nIn other words, they’re following federal statute as to what the process actually is. It doesn’t become part of the Constitution unless the archivist issues a proclamation to that effect. So he’s where the buck stops, and that’s the final decision that has to be made. But they’re right to do it, and it really doesn’t matter whether your state has or hasn’t ratified.\\nI wish that more people, including in this case, feminist groups and so on, … would be more united on the process that has to be followed for our government to function under the Constitution. \\nWe all ought to agree on that, that the Constitution’s rules apply to everyone. No one gets to skirt around a different way, or come up with a way of avoiding what the Constitution requires. Doesn’t matter what your politics are. \\nWe all ought to respect that and insist that the Constitution’s rules be followed. If we do in this case, the ERA has to start over.\\ndel Guidice: Going off of that point, Tom, really quickly, why don’t you think there were Virginia lawmakers—maybe there were a few, I didn’t see any and I could have missed it—that said, “Hey, this deadline has been missed. We have no business doing this”?\\nJipping: Unfortunately, I think we have more politicians than statesman in a lot of our legislatures. I saw quotes from members of the Virginia Legislature, including Republicans, who said, “Well, just let the courts sort that out. This is an important time to take a stand so let’s just let the courts figure that out.” \\nThat’s a complete abdication of their responsibility and it violates their oath of office. They took an oath to support and defend the Constitution and that includes the Constitution’s rules for amending it. And so to simply kind of duck out of that and weasel out of that responsibility and just say, “Ah, the courts will sort it out,”—good grief.\\nThe courts have done enough damage to our country in taking authority away from our elected representatives and away from the people for making these kinds of decisions. That was more than disappointing to hear that. \\nWe ought to have our representatives follow their oath of office, insist on those basic rules, and then we can handle and address our political differences. \\nBut if the system itself is going to crumble because our elected representatives don’t care about it, then we’re in bigger trouble than I thought.\\ndel Guidice: Tom, you mentioned this a little bit earlier, but saying that everything usually ends up in court at some point in time. So, … depending on what happens with different states ratifying, do you foresee a legal battle at some point with the ERA?\\nJipping: Well, I do. If, for example, the archivist were to say, as I think he should, that the last three states to supposedly ratify—that would be Nevada, Illinois in Virginia—their ratifications are not legally sound, and shouldn’t be recognized, then I suppose there might be states in left-wing groups that would go to court to try to force him to do that. \\n … There’s a lot at stake with something that is this symbolic, something that has been around this long. It stands for an awful lot, both positively and negatively. So a lot of political interest would see, one way or another, that their interests are tied up in the ERA, and that usually means that someone will go to court.\\ndel Guidice: You can find Tom’s report, “The 1972 Equal Rights Amendment Can No Longer Be Ratified“—Because It No Longer Exists on heritage.org if you want to learn more about it. Tom, thank you so much for being with us on The Daily Signal Podcast.\\nJipping: Thanks for having me.',\n",
       " 'Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.,  speaks July 17, 2019, on \"Medicare for All\" at George Washington University in Washington. (Photo: Alex Wong/Getty Images)\\n\\nRobert Moffit\\n\\nRobert E. Moffit, Ph.D., a seasoned veteran of more than three decades in Washington policymaking, is a senior fellow in domestic policy studies at The Heritage Foundation.\\n\\nDouglas Holtz-Eakin\\n/\\n@djheakin\\n\\nDouglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, is president of the American Action Forum.\\nA majority of House Democrats are co-sponsoring legislation (HR 1384) to outlaw virtually all Americans’ public and private health insurance and replace their coverage with a new government plan. In the Senate, Sen. Bernie Sanders’ “Medicare for All” bill (S 1129) would accomplish the same objective.\\nAmericans must fully grasp the necessary trade-offs—the sacrifices—they would have to make if Congress were to create and run such a massive program.\\nMedicare for All poses a very big question: Is the promise of universal health  insurance under a new government health program worth the deliberate  destruction of all other public, private, and employer-based coverage?\\nIn today’s churning insurance markets, about 30 million American  residents are uninsured. Examining the data, American Enterprise  Institute analysts note that about 15 million Americans already are eligible for coverage under Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, and the Affordable Care Act of 2010 (also known as ACA or Obamacare).  \\nMysteriously, they do not enroll.\\nAlmost 4 million are eligible for  employer-sponsored insurance, but do not enroll. Several million (at least 4 million) are here illegally and thus ineligible for taxpayer-financed coverage. An additional 2 million have annual incomes that exceed 400% of the federal poverty level ($103,000 for a family of four) and are ineligible for Obamacare insurance subsidies.\\nFinally,  about 2.5 million of the uninsured are poor Americans who live in states that didn’t expand Medicaid. This is a problem that can be solved through targeted measures—without destroying all  existing health coverage.\\nThen there’s the cost. In the initial 10 years of implementing a Medicare for All program, the aggregate price tag could range between $54.6  trillion and $60.7 trillion, according to Charles Blahous, a former  Medicare trustee. \\nComprehensive econometric analyses, ranging from the Urban Institute to the Rand Corp., also show that such a program would substantially increase total costs over current law.\\nMost Americans would also pay more for their health care than they do  today. According to a recent Heritage Foundation analysis, financing  such a program would require broad-based taxation equal to 21.2% of all wage and salary income, and reduce the disposable income of  nearly two-thirds (65.5%) of American households, making them financially worse off than they are today.\\nAnother big trade-off would be a decline in the timely access to quality care. For example, Sanders’ Medicare for All plan would cut medical-provider rates by an estimated 40% below projected private reimbursement. Such a sharp reduction  would inevitably mean increased waiting times, longer delays, and denials  of care.\\nMedicare today sets prices for more than 8,000 physicians’ services and hundreds of hospital procedures in more than 3,000 U.S. counties. Government  price-fixing often results in medical goods or services being reimbursed  at levels that are often too high or too low. In short, either  beneficiaries or taxpayers are routinely shortchanged.\\nCongressional champions of Medicare for All legislation often insist that a new universal Medicare-like entitlement, compared with multi-payer private insurance, would centralize all provider payment and secure significant administrative  cost savings.\\nComparisons between Medicare and private insurance are often apples-to-oranges comparisons. For example, private firms tend to concentrate more heavily (and  successfully) on such items as utilization review, quality measurement, and fraud detection. \\nMedicare does not concentrate as effectively in these areas, and though it  records lower administrative costs, it also loses tens of billions of  dollars annually (roughly 10%) in waste, fraud, abuse, or  “improper” payments.\\nThese are real costs, but they are rarely counted as part of Medicare’s  administrative costs. The Government Accountability Office has recorded more than $50 billion annually in waste, fraud, or abuse. If  today’s Medicare is the model, taxpayers can expect those large annual losses to increase to scale with a universal program.\\nPublic policy is not simply a matter of setting goals. It is also a process of making trade-offs, and Medicare for All has some very serious ones: \\n—Destruction of existing health insurance coverage, regardless of personal preferences.\\n—Abolition of alternatives to government care.\\n—Higher personal and public health care  costs.\\n—Longer wait times and delays and denials of care.\\n—A more thorough politicization of health care decision-making, courtesy of Congress and whatever presidential administration controls the levers of bureaucratic power.\\nCongress can—and should—take a different approach. \\nLawmakers should enact policies that will give individuals and families much greater control over their  health care dollars and decisions, and compel health insurers and medical professionals to compete and deliver high-quality care at competitive prices.\\nOriginally published in The Washington Times',\n",
       " 'It seems that Americans may have been happier, and certainly less lonely, during the Great Depression and World War II than today. (Photo: \\nVichai Phububphapan/Getty Images)\\n\\nDennis Prager\\n/\\n@DennisPrager\\n\\nDennis Prager is a columnist for The Daily Signal, nationally syndicated radio host, and creator of PragerU.\\nI began part one of “Why Are So Many Young People Unhappy?” with data showing the apparently unprecedentedly high rate of unhappiness among young people in America (and elsewhere, but I am focusing on America). \\nThe rates of suicide, self-injury, depression, mass shootings, and loneliness (at all ages) are higher than ever recorded. \\nIt seems that Americans may have been happier, and certainly less lonely, during the Great Depression and World War II than today, even with today’s unprecedentedly high levels of health, longevity, education, and material well-being.\\nThere is, of course, no single explanation, and I listed a number of possible explanations: \\nIncreased use of illicit drugs and prescription drug abuse, and less human interaction because of constant cellphone use are two widely offered, valid explanations. Less valid explanations include competition, grades anxiety, capitalism, and income inequality. And then there are young people’s fears that because of global warming, they have a bleak, and perhaps no, future.\\nBut I do believe that a loss of values and meaning are the two greatest sources of unhappiness. \\nAmong the values lost are those of communal associations. As the great foreign observer of early American life Frenchman Alexis de Tocqueville wrote in 1831, Americans’ unique strength derived largely from their participation in innumerable nongovernmental associations—professional, social, civil, political, artistic, philanthropic, and, of course, religious.\\nBut these have all dwindled as government has become ever larger. Whereas Americans got together and formed bonds of friendship through nongovernmental associations, through what organizations will Americans form friendships today? \\nIn a video presentation at its 2012 national convention, the Democratic Party offered its answer: “Government’s the only thing that we all belong to,” the narrator said.\\nThen there are traditional middle-class values, like getting married first and then having children. \\nToday, a greater percentage of Americans are born to unwed mothers than ever before, and fewer people are marrying than ever before. There are, for the first time in our history, more single Americans than married Americans. \\nWhile it is certainly possible to feel lonely in a marriage, people are far more likely to feel lonely without a spouse, and increasingly without children, than with a spouse and children.\\nAnd now we come to the biggest problem of all: the lack of meaning.\\nAside from food, the greatest human need is meaning. I owe this insight to Viktor\\xa0Frankl\\xa0and his classic work “Man’s Search for Meaning,” which I first read in high school and which influenced me more than any book other than the Bible. \\nKarl Marx saw man as primarily motivated by economics; Sigmund Freud saw man as primarily driven by the sexual drive; Charles Darwin, or at least his followers, sees us as primarily driven by biology.\\xa0\\xa0 \\nBut Frankl was right. \\nAs regards economics, poor people who have meaning can be happy, but wealthy people who lack meaning cannot be.\\nAs regards sex, people who do not have a sexual life (such as priests, who keep their vow of chastity; many widowed and divorced older people; and others) but have meaning can be happy. Sexually active people who do not have meaning cannot be.\\nAs regards biology, there is no evolutionary explanation for the need for meaning. Every creature except the human being does fine without meaning.\\nAnd nothing has given Americans—or any other people, for that matter—as much meaning as religion. But since World War II, God and religion have been relegated to the dustbin of history. \\nThe result?\\xa0 \\nMore than a third of Americans born after 1980 affiliate with no religion. This is unprecedented in American history; until this generation, the vast majority of Americans have been religious.\\nMaybe, just maybe, the death of religion—the greatest provider of meaning, while certainly not the only—is the single biggest factor in the increasing sadness and loneliness among Americans (and so many others). \\nA 2016 study published in the American Medical Association JAMA Psychiatry journal found that American women who attended a religious service at least once a week were five times less likely to commit suicide. Common sense suggests the same is true of men. \\nThe bottom line: The reason so many young people are depressed, unhappy, and angry is the left has told them that God and Judeo-Christian religions are nonsense; their country is largely evil; their past is deplorable; and their future is hopeless.\\nThat seems to be a major reason, if not the reason, for so much unhappiness: not capitalism, not inequality, not patriarchy, sexism, racism, homophobia, or xenophobia but rather having no religion, no God, no spouse, no community, no country to believe in, and, ultimately, no meaning. That explains much of the unprecedented unhappiness. \\nAnd it explains the widespread adoption of that secular substitute for traditional religion: leftism. But unlike Judaism and Christianity, leftism does not bring its adherents happiness. \\nCOPYRIGHT 2020 CREATORS.COM',\n",
       " 'Anti-abortion activists participate in the March for Life, an annual event to mark the anniversary of the 1973 Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion in the U.S., outside the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., Jan. 18, 2019. (Photo: Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images)\\n“Life Empowers: Pro-life Is Pro-Woman” is the theme of this year’s March for Life, set to take place Friday in the nation’s capital. Since 1974, the March for Life has gathered to remember the lives lost since the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade ruling legalizing abortion, and to remind America that each life has value. \\nJeanne Mancini, president of the March for Life, joins The Daily Signal Podcast to discuss what to expect at this year’s march and where the pro-life movement as a whole is headed in 2020. Listen to the podcast or read the lightly edited transcript below.\\xa0 \\nVirginia Allen: I am joined by the president of March for Life, Jeanne Mancini. Jeanne, thank you so much for being with me today.\\nJeanne Mancini: Thanks so much for having me, Virginia.\\nAllen: Now, March for Life began in January of 1974, one year after the passage of Roe v. Wade. March for Life really started out just as a small, peaceful demonstration, but it quickly grew into the world’s largest pro-life event. The 2020 march is taking place on Jan. 24 in Washington, D.C. Can you share with us what the theme is that you all chose for this year’s march?\\nMancini: I’d love to and if it’s OK, I’ll just give a little bit of backdrop that every year we do a lot of thinking and discerning about the appropriate theme because with the March for Life being the only place where all of the different pro-life groups come together annually, it’s an awesome springboard to message, essentially, about what we think are the most cutting edge, most pressing issues in building a culture of life. \\nThemes in past years have included adoption and nubile decision. Another year, in fact, last year, we had pro-life as pro-science and really delved into the science behind embryology and some of the wonderful neonatal surgeries available, etc.\\nThis year our theme is “Life Empowers: Pro-Life Is Pro-Woman.” And, of course, this is the year where we celebrate the centennial anniversary of the 19th Amendment, which created a woman’s right to vote. \\nSo it’s a great opportunity to go back and look at the suffragist, the early feminist, the early female leaders who recognize the inherent dignity of women and the inherent dignity of the unborn. We’re not at odds with each other and they had a really good understanding about that.\\nWe’re having a lot of fun with this theme and we’re excited to be able to talk about that more next week.\\nAllen: Absolutely. Now, who is\\nspeaking at this year’s march?\\nMancini: We’ve got a great, great, great lineup and stay tuned because there are more announcements to be made even tomorrow. \\nLegislatively, we will welcome to the stage Representative Chris Smith, as well as state Representative, state Senator, as of yesterday, Katrina Jackson. \\nChris Smith is very well-known. He’s from New Jersey and just a stalwart on our issues. \\nKatrina Jackson as well is very interesting because she’s one of the few pro-life Democrats and, in particular, we’re so interested to have her this year because she was the author of the bill in Louisiana related to abortion clinic regulations that then became a law. And now will go before the Supreme Court in March. And so it’ll be very interesting to hear from Senator Jackson. \\nSo those are some of our legislative speakers and there’s a few more to be there.\\nWe have Claire Culwell and Melissa Ohden. They both have these incredibly inspiring stories. They both survived abortion, essentially. And their lives are such witnesses and so they’re going to share their stories. And, of course, we’ll link that very much to the born-alive discharge petition in the House. \\nRight now we’ve got Jim Daly from Focus on the Family, Marjorie Dannenfelser, head of Susan B. Anthony List—a good year for Marjorie to speak with the theme. Another wonderful woman, she’s a pro-life leader in New Mexico, Lisa Martinez.\\nWe also have a local pastor, David Platt from McLean Bible Church, a very well-known church here in the D.C. area. He will be doing our closing prayer. \\nAnd, like I said, we’ve got a few more announcements. And I should say our favorite speaker, at least when we do our surveys after the March for Life, is almost always the young person that speaks because, of course, by and large the participants in the March for Life are young people. \\nOur one specific designated young person who’s speaking this year is Catalina Scheider Galiñanes. And she is from Oakcrest, a school in Vienna, Virginia. She’s going to speak about why she’s pro-life.\\nAllen: Wow. So many amazing speakers. I really look forward myself to hearing many of them at the event on the 24th. \\nPeople come to March for Life in Washington, D.C., from states all across America. What is that message or motivation that you are really hoping that marchers will take with them back to their home states and their communities?\\nMancini: The March for Life is very interesting in that it’s a place to come and witness and testify to the beautiful inherent dignity of the unborn person. And yet, ironically, for those of us who participate in the march every year, it’s an opportunity for our own hearts and minds to be changed even more about this issue.\\nI’ll just give you a quick example of that … I know I’m kind of backing my way into the answer here, but I had a family member come and participate from out West last year and it was the first time he had come and he’s always been pro-life, but it was quite a sacrifice to come. \\nHe and his wife and one of his children came and had a really beautiful time. I think … his eyes were opened to the significance of the issue and perhaps his heart was changed even more in the direction of life.\\nAnd while he had a very busy schedule last year with having kind of a … I guess you could say a break from work for a few months as he was changing to a new job. This year, he’s again coming because he realized how important it is and it’s like, again, his own experience was changed and he wants to do more in his local community.\\nSo what I would say is that the March for Life, again, while it’s a moment to testify and to give witness in the public square about the unborn, it also changes our own hearts. \\nOur deepest hope as those of us who pull this event together is that marchers go back home and make a difference in their local community. Because if it’s just one day that we’re coming together and are really [having a] motivating and exciting day, then we’re not doing our job. The job is really recognizing that we each have a role to play in building a culture of life and to do that in the area where we are planted.\\nAllen: Speaking of working in that area where you’re planted, you all have also launched a number of marches across America in different cities. Why did you feel that it was important to not just have the national march but also to have marches in states across America?\\nMancini: Well, a few years ago as a pro-life organization in D.C,. we found that we were being tapped to do all things and there was a bit of … mission creep even within the organization, not terribly so, but it allowed for some reflection. \\nAfter some time I think we were all a little bit burned out and it gave us an opportunity to really look interiorly as well as look up to God and really think about why was the March created and what do we bring to the pro-life movement and to building a culture of life that no other pro-life group brings. \\nSo, what can we do better and more of to end abortion, to change hearts and minds so that abortion is unthinkable in our country? And simultaneously, if you were to ask us, “What is the single thing that you get the most calls about or the most questions about?” It was to help groups start marches in their states and in their local areas.\\nWe didn’t really have the bandwidth to do that well. I mean, we had sort of a very informal toolkit and we take calls and try to give technical assistance, but for the most part, we weren’t really staffed up to be able to help groups do that in a powerful way. So all of that led to a lot of soul-searching and deep discernment with the board.\\nWe decided to try as a beta test, a state march program. So our first state march was in Virginia last year and it was in April and we brought out over 7,000 people for it. And we’re the lead story on the Richmond Times-Dispatch, which is the local Richmond paper. And for so many reasons, it was a huge success and we didn’t quite anticipate that it would be as big of a success as it was. \\nSo this year we’ll have a second march in Virginia on Feb. 13. We’ll also have a march in Pennsylvania. That’s on May 18. And a march in Hartford, Connecticut, on April 15. Stay tuned for more announcements.\\nAllen: That’s so exciting. I do want to take just a moment to ask you to share a little bit about your own pro-life journey and how you got connected with March for Life.\\nMancini: Oh, well, thank you for asking that. Well, let’s see. I grew up in a Catholic family and social justice and just understanding human dignity was something that was ingrained in my understanding of life and the most important things of life. … \\nI was 1 of 5. So we loved life, my family, and definitely lived in a way that was very respectful of life. … \\nAfter college, I did a volunteer corps, I did something called the Jesuit Volunteer Corps. I worked with young people that were in a crisis setting. They were in a youth crisis shelter. \\nThey were being moved either from a situation that wasn’t safe for them to be in or they’d been found on the streets. And there was a long-term search for more of a permanent home, whether that was going to be foster care or a residential treatment center or what have you. \\nSo my time working with those young people was very informative and I grappled a lot with the deeper questions about would it be better if some of these lives hadn’t been born? Is it unfair to bring some lives into the world when there’s such a difficult scenario and such heavy crosses that these people carry that nobody’s ever really meant to carry? \\nAnyways, I did a lot of sort of introspection and I came out on the other side really recognizing that every life is a gift. And I guess realizing with humility, who am I to judge the value of someone’s life because they’ve had some hard things happen to them?\\nAnd then along the way I’ve had different experiences, obviously, in life. For certain one experience [that] weighs heavily on my heart is two people very close to me when I was in college decided to have an abortion and they didn’t tell me before, they told me after. And then in some cases it was a long time after. \\nJust hearing the pain that they underwent was so sad and even this terrible guilt that they were experiencing. Of course, there’s always hope and healing. \\nAnd I should say that to anyone listening to your podcast, anyone who’s been involved in abortion, there’s so many wonderful groups and people to speak with to find hope and healing after having been involved in abortion. \\nBut I just realized personally through these people who were close to me that women deserve so much better than abortion.\\nIt was just a lived experience of what I’d always believed but I thought in a very sad reality in these situations. So, along the way there have been many different I guess you could say epiphanies throughout my life. \\nAnd you asked how I ended up getting to the March for Life. So this is a very long-winded way of answering that. But I guess about 10 or 11 years ago, I was working with Family Research Council and I was their pro-life spokesperson and just loved that job. It was so fun and I got to do a lot of policy analysis, which is really what I love to do. \\nSo, a few years into that job, I was asked to join the board of the March for Life. And I did expecting just to be a board member for a period of time. But I never really made it to my first board meeting without a major happening. And that was that the founder of the March for Life, Nellie Gray, passed away before I went to my first board meeting. \\nSo my first board meeting was an emergency board meeting where we were coming up with a plan for how we were going to continue the march. \\nIn a short-term capacity, I and another board member, Patrick Kelly, took on the leadership and we thought we’d we had our plans for how that was going to happen and here I am seven and a half years later, still working with the March for Life. And lots has changed over that time. But it’s just been a big blessing.\\nAllen: Certainly. That’s so neat just to hear that background and your story and kind of see how all those pieces came together. It’s really, really neat.\\nMancini:\\nThank you.\\nAllen: Increasingly, unfortunately, we are seeing an attitude among the pro-choice movement. It is really not only pro-abortion but advocates flaunting abortion. And you know, we see this through the Shout Your Abortion movement, examples like actress Michelle Williams during her award acceptance speech at the Golden Globes. We could go on and on, but what should the response of pro-lifers be to this really blatantly pro-abortion rhetoric?\\nMancini: I think a couple things. One is to just have great confidence in what we believe. So, to remember that reality is not arbitrary and that calling something a certain name or saying that something shouldn’t have stigma or shame or what have you doesn’t make it so. \\nAbortion—whatever you’re going to call it, if you’re going to shout it, if you’re going to tell your story about it, etc.—always takes the life of one and most frequently wounds the life of another. So calling it something different doesn’t change that reality.\\nSo I think just to A, recognize that. And then B—this might sound a little counterintuitive based on what I just said—to take a very merciful approach. \\nI mean, look, we are in a culture of what I would describe as the walking wounded because so many women and men have been involved in abortion and that very much impacts their response to these kinds of things. There’s so much woundedness around it. And so I think approaching any conversations about this topic with a lot of mercy and love and tenderness is critical.\\nAnd … I feel that we don’t ever have to twist someone’s arm behind their back to agree with us because we should have so much confidence. \\nLife is inherently beautiful and the pro-life message is so positive and attractive. So we really just need to show it for what it is instead of twisting someone’s arm behind their back if they don’t agree with us. \\nConversely, the more that we understand about the abortion industry and even abortion procedures, it’s dark. I mean, it’s really, really dark. So to the extent that we can show that reality for what it is as well, and certainly try to prevent people from any kind of pain and loss of life. I think that’s important too.\\nAllen: President [Donald] Trump is often referred to as the most pro-life president in history. Looking back at his first three years in office, what, to you, are some of the most notable pro-life victories of his administration?\\nMancini: Oh, that’s a great question. In terms of really creating pro-life policy, I would agree he has done more for the pro-life movement than any president when it comes to enacting policy. \\nBecause of my job, I have to just start by talking about the March for Life. Prior to the Trump administration, we never had a president or vice president of the United States come to the march. In fact, a speech writer once told me, and this was a former speech writer, that presidents were counseled to go to Camp David around the time of the March for Life because they didn’t want to be photoed with some graphic images or something like that. \\nSo … there’s almost been a real fear at top levels to associate with something this important. And we’ve seen the opposite from this White House. And it’s been incredible.\\nI will never, ever, ever forget one week after being inaugurated, there was the vice president in person at the March for Life and Kellyanne Conway, who ran a successful campaign. And that was, again, the first time. \\nIt was a historic moment because it was the first time ever in the history of a March [for Life] that a standing vice president had come and spoken in person. \\nThen the following year, President Trump addressed the marchers about a mile away from the rally. So he was in the Rose Garden and there were a couple hundred young people there in the Rose Garden with him on big jumbotrons at the rally’s site. We broadcast that live and that was very exciting. \\nLast year, again, we had Mrs. [Karen] Pence and the vice president. So it’s just been incredible to have that level of support from the administration.\\nBut in terms of amazing policies that they’ve enacted—gosh, there’s been so much. One of my personal favorites is the Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance policy that had been formerly called the Mexico City policy, but that’s been reinstated and broadened. \\nAnother favorite, of course, would be Supreme Court appointments, nominations and confirmations of both Justice [Neil] Gorsuch and [Justice Brett] Kavanaugh. \\nAnd then all of the excellent judicial nominations that are going to be at the appeals court and the district court, I think there have been over 218 of those. I don’t have the number right in front of me, but it’s high. \\nReturning Title 10 funding decisions to the state, launching an investigation into Planned Parenthood. I mean, again and again, there have been so many really, really great things.\\nAllen: Yeah. And just earlier this month, over 200 members of Congress signed an amicus brief asking the Supreme Court to reconsider Roe v. Wade. \\nOf course, like you mentioned, we’ve seen all of these great new policies and legislation come out of the Trump administration. Also … 2019 did see some really devastating pro-choice legislation pushed forward. So what do you think we can expect in 2020?\\nMancini: That’s a great question. Well, I think that some of the things that we need to think about are, first of all, the election. And the March for Life doesn’t endorse candidates, but we do educate. And I think that elections matter. \\nI know having worked in the Office of the Secretary at HHS [the Department of Health and Human Services] and seeing all of the policies change—I was there during the Bush administration and then in the beginning of the Obama administration—I just have to say the pro-life vote makes such a difference. \\nSo, elections matter and to prepare well for the election ahead because it’s going to be a big year. That’s one thing. \\nI know that something that we are very much focusing on at the March for Life this year is the born-alive discharge petition and just the born-alive troops.\\nYou mentioned that there have been so many extreme laws enacted at the state, though. Of course, Illinois now passed the Reproductive Act, which makes it sort of the most pro-abortion state in our country. New York, of course, did last year. Vermont passed another similar law. \\nEssentially, it’s just so critical that we’re aware of these kinds of things and that we do as much as we possibly can to message on the truth about things like the born-alive discharge petition or born-alive bills at the level of the state by the ERA, etc., etc. …\\nYou asked the question and it’s a little hard to know [what to expect this year]. The elections are in front of us. We have a mixed Senate and House, so it’s hard to pass the federal legislation right now. And then in the states there’s all sorts of different things happening. \\nSo to fight the extreme stuff, especially in places like Virginia, my own home state, and we’re seeing the ERA [Equal Rights Amendment] is going to get voted on soon there, but to continue as much as we possibly can to pass good pro-life legislation, for example, the Born-Alive [Abortion Survivors Protection] Act, which any person with common sense would agree with.\\nAllen: And you recently co-authored a commentary for The Daily Signal titled “Early Feminists Were Right About Unborn Human Life.” Can you tell us a little bit more about these American suffragists?\\nMancini: I would love to. To the best of my knowledge, I don’t think that there is even one suffragist who was pro-abortion. \\nSo we’ve got some fantastic quotes from, for example, Alice Paul, who called abortion the ultimate exploitation of women. Elizabeth Cady Stanton was very strong in her views on this. Of course, Susan B. Anthony, etc. \\nBut these early female pioneers, again, knew that a woman’s capacity for fertility and motherhood wasn’t a liability, but that it was a beautiful thing. I think they saw men and women as being equal in dignity but different not having to do away with the part of them that can make them mothers. \\nSo it’s wonderful to look back and to see sort of this first wave of feminists and where they were coming from and their understanding of these kinds of issues. And then to see sort of where things are today and how far we’ve gotten from that. \\nFor any of your listeners who have an interest in that, I cannot highly recommend enough coming to our conference the day before the March for Life. \\nOur keynote is one of my favorite speakers, especially on this topic. Erika Bachiochi—she’s a pro-life feminist and a legal scholar at the Ethics and Public Policy Center. And she’s got so much to say about this and herself has a tremendous testimony and story of coming from a more pro-abortion feminist perspective to where she is today.\\nAnd then we have a stellar lineup of panelists, very much speaking to different nuances about this. Sue Ellen Browder will be speaking, she’s an author, she wrote a wonderful book called “Subverted.” Now she’s got a book coming out called “Sex and the Catholic Feminist.” She’s essentially going to go into this question that you just asked me, what the early suffragettes said and a history of that. She’ll read quotes and papers, etc. \\nWe also have Christina Francis, OB-GYN, who’s the chairman of the board of AAPLOG, the American Association of Pro-life OB-GYNs, and she’s going to talk about the consequences of abortion and especially the physiological consequences.\\nWe also have Mary McCluskey, who works with Project Rachel Ministry on helping women and men who regret having been involved in abortion. And then Brandi Swindell, who’s the founder and CEO of Stanton Healthcare—named after Elizabeth Cady Stanton, of course, an early suffragist. \\nSo I highly recommend coming in and hearing about our theme.\\nAllen: And how can our listeners find out more about the march that’s happening in D.C. and then the state marches that are going to be taking place throughout this year?\\nMancini: Well, follow us on all of our different mediums on social media, and check us out particularly on our website at marchforlife.org, and you can count down the hours, like you mentioned, Virginia, right at the beginning.\\nAllen: Yeah. Thank you so much,\\nJeanne. We just really appreciate your time.\\nMancini: Thanks for having me. It’s been a pleasure.',\n",
       " 'President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un stand on North Korean soil at the Demilitarized Zone on June 30, 2019. (Photo: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images)\\n\\nOlivia Enos\\n/\\n@OliviaEnos\\n\\nOlivia Enos is an Asian Studies Center senior policy analyst within The Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy at The Heritage Foundation.\\n“If you step forward, you will be the first U.S. president to cross the border,” said Kim Jong Un through a translator to President Donald Trump on Sunday. \\nThe two men stood at the Demilitarized Zone on the border of North and South Korea. That moment made history. \\nThe question is: Will it have a significant impact on stalled negotiations?\\nDiplomacy between the two leaders seemed to have hit a roadblock since the Hanoi summit in February, which ended abruptly when the two leaders left Vietnam without a deal. The swirl of summitry that began in Singapore last year has, so far, resulted in little progress. \\nTo put a\\nfiner point on it, North Korea is no closer to complete, verifiable,\\nirreversible dismantlement of its nuclear program than it was prior to the\\nfirst meeting between Trump and Kim. For that matter, it is also failing to\\nimprove its egregious track record of human rights abuse.\\nSunday’s last-minute meeting between Trump and Kim was prompted by a presidential tweet. This set into motion a photo op that handed Kim yet another legitimizing appearance on the world stage without having made any major concessions in negotiations.\\nThe\\nprimary deliverable from Sunday’s meeting was a promise to resume working-level\\nnegotiations. While this is a positive development, it’s hardly a promise\\nworthy of fanfare. \\nKim is a brutal dictator—one who imprisons between 80,000 and 120,000 people in political prison camps, murders people in broad daylight for merely possessing a Bible, and restricts all of the freedoms that Americans hold so dear. That’s to say nothing of its illegal nuclear and missile programs.\\nKim, no doubt, desires legitimacy. Every time the two leaders meet and Kim makes no concessions, he is emboldened to press the U.S. to accept North Korea as a nuclear power, and for that matter, a legitimate state—of which it is neither.\\nFollowing the historic meeting at the DMZ, there are now rumblings that the administration might be considering a “freeze for freeze”—essentially, North Korea freezing its nuclear program in exchange for the U.S. lifting some of the tougher sanctions on Pyongyang. \\nThis would essentially acknowledge North Korea as a nuclear state, something that negotiators refused to do in previous negotiations. \\nThis would\\nbe a mistake. A freeze-for-freeze would undermine the most successful pillar of\\nthe Trump administration’s North Korea strategy—the maximum pressure policy—and\\nwould fall short of legally-required standards that North Korea denuclearize\\nprior to getting sanctions relief. \\nThis is not the first time diplomacy has impacted the maximum pressure policy. \\nAfter the Singapore summit, Russia and China reportedly began easing implementation of their sanctions—sanctions that North Korea acknowledged helped bring them to the negotiating table in Hanoi. Kim would like nothing more than to see these sanctions lifted.\\nNow that\\nthe DMZ meeting has happened, the question is, “Where do we go from here?” \\nU.S. negotiators should use working-level dialogue to press North Korea to accept the legally-required definition of denuclearization and to lay out a step-by-step process to irreversibly dismantle its nuclear program. \\nAnd, rather than viewing human rights as an afterthought, the administration should press for improvements to human rights, recognizing that the Kim regime uses human rights abuses to retain power for itself and continue its nuclear and missile programs. \\nGoing forward, the administration should articulate a comprehensive strategy where both national security and human rights challenges are addressed in tandem. It should refrain from high-level, diplomatic photo ops that bring us no closer to solving these problems. ',\n",
       " 'An opinion from Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas tying abortion to eugenics \"keeps truth, hope, and justice alive,\" Alveda King tells The Daily Signal. (Photo: Prince Williams / Contributor/Getty Images)\\nSupreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas is right to call out some abortions as a form of eugenics, a niece of civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr. told The Daily Signal.\\nThomas’ concern, expressed in a Supreme Court opinion Tuesday, is not only relevant but “keeps truth, hope, and justice alive,” Alveda King said the next day in a phone interview.\\n“It is so important and it’s so true that abortion is eugenics,” King said when asked about Thomas’ opinion. “And Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, basically said colored people were like weeds and need to be exterminated.”\\nThomas made his comments in a concurring opinion as the high court upheld an Indiana law requiring abortion providers to bury or cremate fetal remains, but declined to review another Indiana law banning abortions on the basis of sex, race, or disability.\\n“Given the potential for abortion to become a tool of eugenic manipulation, the Court will soon need to confront the constitutionality of laws like Indiana’s,” Thomas wrote. \\nNevertheless, Thomas wrote that he joined fellow justices in deciding not to hear arguments on the Indiana law banning selective abortions until more lower courts had addressed the issue. \\nIn his opinion, Thomas traced the intertwined history of abortion, eugenics, and Planned Parenthood, which grew into the nation’s largest abortion provider.\\nKing, a former Georgia state legislator, is now director of civil rights for the unborn at the organization Priests for Life.\\nShe told The Daily Signal that “evidence of a eugenics effort” could be seen in Planned Parenthood founder Sanger’s “Birth Control League, her Negro Project, [and] giving free vasectomies and free tubal ligations to colored people, [as] they called us back then.”\\nEugenics is a way of controlling reproduction so that only “desired” populations produce offspring, and not “undesired” ones. \\nAbortion has made eugenics more palatable to American society, Thomas wrote. \\n“The individualized nature of abortion gives it even more eugenic potential than birth control, which simply reduces the chance of conceiving any child,” the 70-year-old justice wrote, adding that “abortion has proved to be a disturbingly effective tool for implementing the discriminatory preferences that undergird eugenics.”\\nSanger reportedly ran in Ku Klux Klan circles and she wrote about meeting with the white supremacy organization in her autobiography.\\n But King, whose father A.D. King also was a Baptist minister and civil rights leader, said Sanger’s involvement with the Klan and eugenics has fallen under the radar. \\n“Margaret Sanger herself was a consultant for the Ku Klux Klan [and] we know that part of the agenda of Planned Parenthood has always been—and the abortion lobby—is to minimize and control the African-American population and other minority populations,” King said. \\xa0\\xa0 \\nThose who claim to fight for “women’s rights” need to be sure they are not neglecting others’ right to life, she said. \\n“Passion sometimes can be clouded by emotion, and that way, it’s not always as helpful as it’s desired or intended to be,” King said.\\n“And so when you are trying to give rights to women, the emotional pull on that forgets the civil rights of the child and the person in the womb, because sometimes emotion can cloud genuine compassion and action.”',\n",

Send an email to Genevieve.\\nImmigration is one of the fundamental building blocks that help\\nmake America the unique nation that it is.\\nBut the debate over border security and immigration has become\\ntoxic because politicians have put politics before principles. And reasonable\\nAmericans find themselves trapped between zealots on both sides.\\nFor over two centuries, the United States has welcomed millions of people from every corner of the globe. And today, we lawfully admit over 1 million people every year. That is more than any other country in the world.\\nThe debate is not about whether we should allow immigration—it’s about how we do so in a way that protects American sovereignty, respects the rule of law, and is beneficial to all Americans.\\nSo what does a thoughtful agenda for American immigration reform\\nlook like?\\nHere are four guiding principles:\\n1. We must respect the consent of the governed—that is, the will of the people.\\nIndividuals who are not citizens do not have a right to American citizenship without the consent of the American people. That consent is expressed through the laws of the United States.\\nThrough those laws, we the people invite individuals from other\\ncountries, under certain conditions, to join us as residents and fellow\\ncitizens. \\n2. We cannot compromise national security and public safety.\\nEvery nation has the right, recognized by both international and\\ndomestic law, to secure its borders and ports of entry and control what and who\\nis coming into its country. \\nA disorganized and chaotic immigration system encourages people\\nto go around the law and is a clear invitation to those who wish to take\\nadvantage of our openness to harm the nation. \\nSecure borders, especially in a time of terrorist threat, are\\ncrucial to American national security.\\n3. Becoming a citizen means becoming an American. We must preserve patriotic assimilation.\\nThe founding principles of this nation imply that an individual of any ethnic heritage or racial background can become an American. That’s why we have always welcomed immigrants seeking the promises and opportunities of the American dream.\\nPatriotic assimilation is the bond that allows America to be a\\nnation of immigrants. Without it, we cease to be a country with a distinct\\ncharacter, becoming instead a hodgepodge of different groups.\\nIf we are to be a united nation, living up to our motto of e pluribus unum—out of many, one—we all must understand and embrace a common language, history, and civic culture.\\nAnd that not only benefits America, but also those immigrants and\\ntheir families who aspire to prosper here.\\n4. Our lawmakers must respect the rule of law, and immigration is no exception.\\nFailure to enforce our immigration laws is unfair to those who\\nobey the law and follow the rules to enter the country legally.\\nThose who enter and remain in the country illegally should not\\nbe rewarded with legal status or other benefits. When politicians condone such\\nbehavior they only encourage further illegal conduct.\\nBased on these principles, immigration reform should include transitioning to a merit-based system. We should end practices like chain migration, birthright citizenship, the visa lottery, arbitrary per-country immigration caps, and any form of amnesty for those here illegally.\\nWe must close loopholes that prevent enforcement of our laws and\\nhave overwhelmed immigration courts, allowing illegitimate asylum claimants and\\nother lawbreakers to remain in the U.S. indefinitely.\\nAnd we must take on these issues one by one. A comprehensive “deal” subjects the fate of policies with universal appeal to the fate of the most controversial topics. The key is to begin by working on the solutions on which most Americans agree.\\nWe must and can address this issue in a manner that is fair, responsible, humane, and prudent. This is too important an issue to not get right and too important an issue to be driven by partisan agendas.\\nLet’s stay focused on what is best for the welfare of all Americans, both those of today and those of the future.',\n",

James formerly served as director of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management and as Virginia's secretary of health and human resources. She is also the founder and president of The Gloucester Institute.\\nThis week, as Americans commemorate\\xa0Independence Day\\xa0and the creation of the most free, most prosperous nation on earth, we will inevitably hear from those who say there’s no reason to celebrate a country where not everyone gained their freedom or their equality in 1776. \\nThey will say that a nation stained with the evil of slavery, a nation that once refused women and blacks the right to vote or hold property, isn’t a nation worth lauding.\\nAs a woman and as a black person who lived through segregation, I have experienced both the inequality and the opportunity of this nation. \\nAs a student of history and as someone who works with governments around the world, I know how women and minorities are treated in other societies compared to the United States. \\nBecause of these experiences, I want to tell you exactly why America is worth celebrating.\\nDespite their flawed nature as human beings, our Founders laid out principles for forming a nation based on humanity’s highest ideals. Nowhere else on earth had that ever been done before. \\nThose founding principles have guided this nation and created a framework that allows society to recognize the error of its ways.\\nThe fact is, we abolished slavery. We even fought a war over it. We ultimately recognized women’s and minorities’ right to vote, to own property, and to have the full and equal rights of any other citizen. \\nWe have endeavored through our laws and our actions to eradicate the unequal treatment and marginalization of fellow Americans because of their ethnicity, religion, politics, or other characteristics.\\nJuly 4, 1776—and the principles that day epitomized—began the foundation for a nation that would right its own wrongs.\\nThe unfortunate reality is that we had to grow into our principles. The Founders knew what we aspired to be, but the country wasn’t there yet and even today, we still have a ways to go. \\nIn fact, every Founder admitted in his writings that slavery contradicted the equality principle of the Declaration of Independence. \\nThey knew that it would be a journey for us to fully realize our ideals, but they set a course for achieving them, and every generation since has been working to advance them. \\nThat’s what has made America the unique and wonderful nation that it is.\\nI love America not only because we’ve grown to rectify many of our wrongs, but also because we’ve been an incredibly positive force for good. \\nWe’ve built a free and prosperous nation where anyone has the opportunity to thrive and live out their dreams. We’ve also shared that gift with the world, helping others to achieve the same.\\nDespite that success, we continue to hear from the “America is irreparably flawed” crowd that our freedom and free market system only bring opportunity to the wealthy and well connected. They claim that the system just makes the rich richer and the poor poorer.\\nThe reality is exactly the opposite: Capitalism has done more to lift people out of poverty than any other economic system in history. \\nPlain and simple, over the last 25 years, it has been free markets that have cut the global poverty rate by two-thirds. \\nIn the United States, every segment of the population—including women, minorities, and even the lowest income earners—have seen their incomes rise and their opportunities grow.\\nRealizing that people around the world deserve the same blessings of freedom and prosperity that we have, Americans work through our government, nonprofits, and private charities to spread these blessings to other countries. \\nWe’ve even helped others fight for their very freedom—from both world wars to peacekeeping missions around the world. \\nDespite the leftists who call our nation imperialist, when we help other countries defeat tyrants or repel invaders, we don’t use the opportunity to conquer them and build an empire. Rather, we help them to rebuild and become self-sufficient.\\nThese are all proofs of a nation reaching for its highest ideals.\\nWhile it took too long to correct many of America’s early injustices, and while we will always be a work in progress, our founding principles themselves created the framework that has allowed us to solve some of our biggest issues. \\nWhile not perfect, we are a great force for good that works to bring freedom, prosperity, and that problem-solving ability to our own land and to others that want to replicate them. This is all part of what we are celebrating on\\xa0Independence Day.\\nAlexis de Tocqueville said admiringly of America, “The greatness of America lies not in being more enlightened than any other nation, but rather in her ability to repair her faults.” His words still ring true almost 200 years later.\\nSo, on this\\xa0Independence Day, I encourage you to join me in watching fireworks, eating hot dogs and apple pie, proudly celebrating America, and continuing to work toward the vision of the nation our Founders thought we could be.\\nHappy\\xa0Independence Day!\\nOriginally published in The Washington Times. \",\n",

The BBC reporter asks one of\\nthe men whether it was his choice to be in a political reeducation facility.\\n“Yes,” he replies. “A policeman at my village told me to get enrolled in the\\nschool and transform my thoughts.”\\nThe reporter also speaks to Chinese officials. Nearly every one alludes to the notion that the roughly 800,000 to 1 million people interned in Xinjiang are affected by religious extremism and in need of reeducation so that their thinking aligns with the Chinese Communist Party. \\xa0\\nThe\\nconflation of religion with extremism took shape in new regulations instituted\\nin February of last year. These regulations continue the government’s practice\\nof “Sinicizing”—or secularizing—religion, so that it conforms to the core\\ntenets of the Communist Party.\\nIn\\naddition to “thought transformation,” people in these facilities must undergo\\nMandarin lessons, self-criticism sessions, forced labor, and even torture. Occasionally,\\nthere are deaths. \\nSo-called vocational training is a core component of most inmates’ curriculum. One Chinese official in the report explained that inmates spend between two to four months learning how to do simple tasks like making a bed. \\nThe\\nreality—which was not shown in the report—is that these people are subject to forced labor,\\nproducing goods that likely make their way into U.S. supply chains. \\nOne case reported by the Associated Press suggests that Badger Sportswear, a North Carolina-based company, had its supply chain tainted with goods produced by a Chinese business, Hetian Taida Apparel, which shares warehouses with a political reeducation facility in Xinjiang. \\nIf the allegations are true, Badger Sportswear may face repercussions for importing goods produced with forced labor into the U.S.\\nThe BBC\\nreporter notes up front that the facilities they were permitted to visit were\\ncleaned up for journalists’ prying eyes. Satellite images showed that prior to\\nthe BBC’s visit, watchtowers and barbed wire were removed from the premises and\\nbarren outdoor spaces were transformed into sports facilities.\\nDocumentaries like this one are incredibly important to building a human rights case against the Chinese government. They provide additional evidence, especially of what the Chinese government wants the outside world to see. \\nSuch evidence augments the troves of satellite imagery collected over the last several years and eye-witness testimony of former prisoners, who can testify that these facilities are far from benign.\\nThe existence of these facilities and the hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people arbitrarily detained within their walls is now irrefutable. Which raises the question: How will the world respond?\\nEarlier this year, The Heritage Foundation released a cutting-edge report on the crisis in Xinjiang.

The purpose of the exhibit is to highlight the role of average Americans and their response to the events of the Holocaust.\\nAs I wandered the halls of the museum, my eyes were drawn to articles from World War II highlighting Kristallnacht and the concentration camps of Nazi Germany. But nothing was more stunning than the row of miniature suitcases lined up—each one representing 1,000 Jewish people (mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, grandmothers, grandfathers) who sought asylum in the United States.\\nThe exhibit transitioned quickly from the reality of the needs (hundreds of thousands seeking asylum) to the U.S. response. American journalists wrote droves of articles; student groups lobbied; and Treasury Secretary\\xa0Henry Morgenthau, the lone Jewish member of FDR’s Cabinet, paved the way for the creation of the War Refugee Board that resulted in more than 100,000 European Jews being resettled in the U.S. and ultimately spared during the Holocaust.\\nNow, instead of witnessing the assault of the German government on Jewish people, the American people are watching history repeat itself, as another government—this time,\\xa0China—launches an all-out assault on the Muslim religious minority Uighurs.\\nThe breakneck speed with which the Chinese government has collectivized and interred what is now believed to be 1.8 million Muslims in political reeducation camps is breathtaking.\\nThe facts are now undeniable.\\nThe recent leak of classified data from\\xa0China\\xa0by The New York Times confirmed the existence of a vast web of political prison camps that Xinjiang expert Adrian Zenz of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation now believes number between 1,300 and 1,400.\\nThe data leak, now termed the Xinjiang Papers, traces the massive repression and internment directly to the very top of the Chinese political system. There can be no doubt that Xi Jinping created, sold, and orchestrated this modern phenomenon in partnership with Xinjiang Party Secretary Chen Quanguo. \\nThe proposal of mass collectivization and arbitrary detention of nearly 2 million people was apparently objected to by some members of the Chinese Communist Party. The Xinjiang Papers reveals that those who objected were subsequently purged.\\nThere is no shortage of reasons why anyone might object to these camps. Prisoners in the camps are subject to reeducation reminiscent of the Cultural Revolution. Forced to recant their religious beliefs or at least make them conform with the CCP’s ends, they are also induced to forsake their native language in favor of Mandarin. \\nNew reports indicate that individuals in the camps may be subject to forced sterilization and are injected with unknown substances to be experimented on like lab rats. Torture is increasingly reported, and some have even died while in custody.\\nWhile Chinese authorities have sought to sell reeducation camps as vocational training centers that Uighurs graduate from and go on to live so-called reformed lives, what that means in practice are countless Uighurs missing, their family members lucky enough to be abroad calling attention to their cases and even starting a Twitter campaign, #StillNoInfo, as they search for those still missing. \\nIt also means well-educated Uighurs being forced to trade in their white-collar jobs for work in factories that leave them dependent on the Chinese state for their income.\\nWhat sets collectivization of the Uighurs apart from previous periods of collectivization, both in\\xa0China, but also in other parts of the world, is the rapid pace in which it took place.\\nThe speed at which such a large population of people could be uprooted from their homes and extrajudicially interned was made possible principally through surveillance technology—technology that, according to Human Rights Watch, deems it suspicious to exit out the back door rather than the front door of your home, and sees attendance at mosque as grounds for interrogation or internment. \\nNormal human behavior, to live one’s life according to one’s closely-held beliefs, is seen as threatening the Chinese Communist Party, to whom the state supersedes all other allegiances.\\nIn the face of such atrocities, it is easy for individuals and governments to feel paralyzed. After all, how does one respond to such distortions of human existence like the Holocaust, genocide in Rwanda, Darfur or Burma, or the gulags of the Soviet Union?\\nThe Americans and the Holocaust exhibit really was a charge to all Americans.\\nTo the American people—who among you will call on your elected leaders to respond? Who will be a good neighbor? Even to your neighbor across the Pacific.\\nWill you be there for them in their time of need?\\nTo the students—who will organize student groups and events to raise awareness?\\nTo civil society—Who will write the articles and document the evidence for future justice? Who will hold prayer meetings? Who will support local Uighurs recently resettled in the United States as they mourn lost family members or try to find those still missing?\\nTo the U.S. government—who will be the next\\xa0Henry Morgenthau?\\nThe American people have a beautiful penchant for loving and caring—a philanthropic spirit, as it is often described. This is because U.S. leaders such as Ronald Reagan called us to our better selves—to be that shining city on a hill—in whatever form that looks like in the present.\\nPersecution of the Uighurs demands a strong U.S. response, but as illustrated in the case of the Holocaust, it took pressure from the American people, from civil society, and leaders in the U.S. government to be willing to lead and do what it is possible for the United States to do to serve those in need in the face of such earth-shattering atrocities.\\nDoing what is possible means advancing freedom and values in Asia.\\nDoing what is possible means sanctioning Chen Quanguo.\\nDoing what is possible may involve granting priority refugee resettlement status to Uighurs.\\nIn the face of such severe human rights violations, the United States should not miss this opportunity to demonstrate its commitment to freedom wherever it is challenged. Today, it’s in\\xa0China.\\nOriginally published in The Washington Times',\n",

Video of the shooting spread quickly on the internet. Thankfully, the student is stabilized.\\nThe shot itself represented the sharpest uptick in violence since the protests began. But Monday night’s protests were also among the more violent and stood in sharp contrast to what have been, thus far, largely peaceful efforts to ensure the long-term preservation of fundamental freedoms in Hong Kong. \\nThe police official who fired the shot\\nclaimed self-defense, saying that he thought his life was in danger. The shot\\nwas reportedly fired amid a standoff in which protesters allegedly hit security\\nofficials with metal pipes, while others are said to have swarmed, tackled, and\\nbeat up another riot officer. \\nIn addition to that incident, many news\\nagencies reported an overall uptick in violence, with protesters throwing gasoline bombs in subway\\nstations, throwing rocks at windows, and\\ndamaging private property.\\nRegardless of the circumstances that led to the 18-year-old student protester getting shot, though not fatally, many in Hong Kong and the international community will see this as a clear-cut case of police brutality and a misuse of force. \\nHong Kong’s “shot heard around the world” will hopefully lead the special administrative region’s authorities to finally undertake an independent inquiry into police brutality. That’s something that protesters have made repeated requests for and clearly the thing that could best calm the situation. \\n>>> ‘We Are Facing One of the Biggest Authoritarian States’: A Hong Kong Politician Speaks Out\\nDemonstrators first took to the streets\\nearlier this year in response to the Legislative Council’s proposed extradition\\nbill, which, if passed, would have permitted individuals to be extradited to\\nChina at Beijing’s request. \\nThe proposed bill—which was tabled and\\nthen later fully withdrawn by Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam—posed an\\nexistential threat to the rule of law there. \\nThe withdrawal of the bill was a notable success for protesters, but came at the 11th hour and was perceived as too little, too late by many in Hong Kong. In spite of the bill’s withdrawal, protests continued. And as demonstrations continued, demands grew.\\nWhile, initially, protesters simply wanted the extradition bill fully withdrawn, their demands have since increased from one to five. They now include a call for an independent inquiry into police violence, amnesty for all protesters, universal suffrage, and a request that protests not be referred to as “riots.” \\nSome have also called for the removal of Lam from office. \\n>>> Protests Escalate in Hong Kong\\nThe U.S. should continue to be\\nsupportive of peaceful protests and urge restraint on both sides. \\nViolence is rarely an effective way to secure liberty, and protesters who have taken to the streets in defense of the rule of law and freedom do their cause a disservice by flouting the rule of law themselves. \\nThe international community should also send an unequivocal signal that it will not tolerate police brutality in Hong Kong. It could do so by supporting calls for an independent inquiry into the conduct of security forces. \\nThere have been a number of instances over the past several weeks and months in which protesters sustained serious harm at the hands of the Hong Kong security forces. It’s a complicated situation, and the emotions at play are intense. \\n>>> What Hong Kong Unrest Tells Us About China’s Plans for the Rest of the World\\nWhatever the events that have led to the current impasse between protesters and police, however, the reputation of the police must be restored. \\nIt is difficult to see how that happens\\nwithout systematically and independently addressing the grievances that have\\naccumulated since the protests started.

Time is running out.\\nIn\\nlight of these significant challenges, Congress sprang into action.\\nThe House Foreign Affairs Committee passed the Divided Families Reunification Act (H.R. 1771) with bipartisan support on Oct. 30. It awaits a vote in the full House. \\nThe bill would direct the State Department and the U.S. special envoy on North Korea human rights to prioritize reunions of Korean American divided families and their family members in North Korea.\\nThe\\nterm “divided family” refers to those who are separated from their relatives\\ndue to the division of the Korean Peninsula. That tragic separation has lasted\\nfor more than 60 years. \\nMany\\nof them are not even sure whether their loved ones are still alive. According\\nto the Ministry of Unification in South Korea, 133,361 people are registered in the Divided\\nFamily Information System. \\nDivided families are classified into four groups: \\nThe\\nHouse Foreign Affairs Committee’s recent attention is nothing new. Congress has long sought to shed light on this\\npressing issue. \\nIn 2007, the Congressional Commission on Divided Families was founded. Since then, the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal 2008 (H.R. 4986, Section 1265) was passed by Congress and signed into law by President George W. Bush. It required the president to report to Congress on necessary governmental efforts to facilitate family reunions.\\nCongress also discussed calling on the\\nU.S. special representative on North Korea policy to prioritize the divided-family\\nissue and to designate a coordinator for the families, if necessary. \\nHistorically, it has been a lack of political will at the executive branch level in Washington and Pyongyang that has stymied progress. Most recently, family reunions were not raised at either of the U.S.-North Korea summits in Singapore or Hanoi. \\nWhen\\nthe Voice of America asked about the possibility of family\\nreunions after the Singapore summit, the State Department just repeated a perfunctory\\nstatement that it was committed to building a close relationship with North\\nKorea for peace and prosperity. \\nNorth\\nKorea has made a limited number of statements on family reunions. In August\\n2017, North Korea’s Permanent Mission to the United Nations sent a letter to the Northern California\\nCouncil of Korean Americans from North Korea saying that it would actively\\nsupport the association’s family-reunion projects. \\nHowever,\\nit has never led to a government-to-government agreement. If the subject of\\nfamily reunions is broached during negotiations, it’s highly likely that Pyongyang\\nwill seek compensation in return for hosting reunions, an unreasonable demand the\\nU.S. is unlikely to meet.\\nStill, that shouldn’t prevent the Trump administration from trying. As it considers issues to prioritize, the reunion of Korean American divided families should be on the list, especially given the time-sensitive nature of the challenge. \\nWorking-level talks between the U.S. and North Korean counterparts in Stockholm in October ended with no agreement. Talks remain stalled, but if they resume, hosting family reunions might be a small issue where Washington and Pyongyang can make progress and maintain momentum in negotiations.\\nFamily\\nreunions may also provide an opportunity for Seoul and Washington to work\\ntogether. The South Korean government has years of experience hosting family\\nreunions with North Korea and may be able to assist the U.S. as it considers a\\ntenable process to start hosting family reunions. \\nThe\\nreunification of ethnic-Korean families, especially those involving Americans,\\nshould be a priority for policymakers. Congress deserves high marks for helping\\nmake it one. ',\n",

Since 2017, more\\nthan 1 million Muslim minorities, including Uighurs, have\\nbeen taken to detention without any\\nproper trials. \\nDetainees are\\nforced to show their loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party and deny their Islamic\\nfaith. Forced\\nlabor and torture are\\ncommon.\\nUighur\\nwomen testify to the horrors they have endured, including new reports of forced\\nsterilization. One Uighur woman interviewed by\\nFrench television said she was constantly injected with a substance during her\\ndetention that stopped her periods. \\nMihrigul\\nTursun, another Uighur woman now living in exile in the U.S., first testified before\\nthe Congressional Executive Commission on China last November. This month, she raised\\nalarm over forced sterilization again at Amnesty\\nInternational’s conference in Tokyo.\\nShe had\\nbeen detained in a re-education camp three separate times and said the\\nofficials forced the Uighur women to take unknown drugs and drink some kind of\\nwhite liquid. Those caused them to lose consciousness and sometimes to lose\\nmenstruation. \\nSome of\\nthe Uighur women even died from extreme bleeding. \\nAfter coming to the U.S., Tursun underwent a proper medical examination, which confirmed her worst fears. She had in fact been sterilized and would never be able to bear children again.\\nShe added triplets that she had given birth to prior to internment underwent an unknown surgery without any consent during her detention. One of them died, and the other two still have health problems.\\nWhile reports of human rights violations in the camps are a dime a dozen, Chinese officials continue to insist that they are just re-educating Uighurs to protect the region from Islamist attacks. \\nShohrat Zakir, Xinjiang’s Uighur governor, defended the practices as vocational training for Uighurs by comparing them with boarding schools. But these are no boarding schools.\\nUighur repression is one component of the Chinese Communist Party’s “Sinicization” policy. Since Chinese President Xi Jinping took power, the party has sought to make religion conform to the party’s doctrine and Han-ethnicity customs. \\xa0\\nThe Chinese\\nCommunist Party also threatens future generations of Uighurs. Children whose\\nparents are detained in the camps are often sent to state-run\\norphanages and brainwashed to\\nforget their ethnic roots. \\nEven if\\ntheir parents are not detained, Uighur children need to move to inner China and\\nimmerse themselves into Han culture under the Chinese government’s “Xinjiang\\nclassrooms” policy.\\nThe reports of forced sterilization are leading many to fear\\ncomplete cultural genocide of the Uighur population. \\nGenocide is defined in both international law and U.S. law as the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, an ethnic, racial, religious, or political group. According to international law, an attempt to restrict births and forcibly moving children to another group are two methods a country can employ to carry out genocide. \\nThe international community should be alarmed that China is destroying an ethnic minority by infringing on its personal decisions related to family planning and religious freedom.\\nOne of the reasons the U.S. withdrew its funding from the\\nUnited Nations Population Fund was China’s coercive family-planning policies\\nthat restrict the number of children the average Chinese family can have to\\ntwo. \\nDriven by concerns that China was using money from the U.N. Population Fund to carry out forced abortions, the Trump administration pulled all U.N. Population Fund funding, as recommended in a Heritage Foundation  report. \\nThe U.S. should consider additional steps it\\ncan take to respond to the Xinjiang crisis, especially anything that it can do\\nto respond to reports of forced sterilization. \\nAs Tursun mentioned in her testimony, Uighurs “look to the\\nUnited States as the beacon of hope for the oppressed people around the world.”\\n\\nNow is the time for the U.S. and the international community\\nto respond to the crisis in Xinjiang with strong resolve.

But his execution could happen any day now. \\nGiven the severity of\\nthe ongoing crisis in Xinjiang—an estimated 1 million or more minority Muslim\\nUighurs are held by the Chinese government in political re-education facilities\\ntoday—the U.S. has a responsibility to act. \\xa0\\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has called consistently for the release of all those arbitrarily detained in Xinjiang, should press now, along with others in the administration, for the release of Tiyip and all those detained in Xinjiang.\\nTiyip was a professor in the geography department at Xinjiang University and in 2010 became president of the school. As was required, he was a member of the Chinese Communist Party. \\nBefore his apprehension, Tiyip was respected as a model of how Uighurs could succeed within the Chinese system and even acknowledged by Chinese state media as a “model minority leader.” \\nHow did the “model\\nminority leader” fall from grace?\\nAccording to reports, Tiyip was sentenced to death because the Chinese government suspected he was a separatist. \\nThe promotion of separatism is a non-starter in China, whose government prizes sovereignty as one of its primary foreign and domestic policy priorities (the other being the continued rule of the Chinese Communist Party). \\nThose who knew Tiyip say accusations of separatism are false. It’s more likely that Tiyip’s high-profile academic status and myriad travels abroad made him a prime target in the midst of the Chinese government’s broader crackdown on Uighurs. \\nThe exact details of how and why he was apprehended are largely unknown given that the trial was secret.\\nTiyip’s targeting comports with a broader trend. Some of the first targets of China’s efforts to collectivize and arbitrarily detain Uighurs in Xinjiang were Uighur students studying abroad, Uighurs living abroad, or Uighurs with family living abroad. \\nMany were lured back to Xinjiang—with threats levied against their families if they did not return—only to be arbitrarily detained in the estimated 143 camps where there are reports of torture, self-criticism sessions, and even limited reports of death in the camps. \\nFormer detainees confirm these abuses and others.

His arrest came on the heels of the government shutting down three large, unregistered churches, including Wang’s congregation, Early Rain Covenant Church in Chengdu. \\nWang was\\ntaken into custody along with his wife and more than 100 of Early Rain’s congregants.\\nExcept for Wang, all others were eventually released. \\nNow, a\\nlittle more than a year in custody, Wang has been charged by the Chengdu Intermediate\\nPeople’s Court with “illegal business operations” and “inciting subversion of state\\npower.” The latter is a charge frequently brought in order to silence perceived\\npolitical opponents in China. \\nSuch politically\\nmotivated charges are especially pernicious because they often come with the deprivation of political rights, meaning\\nthe prisoner cannot\\nvote or be elected, or exercise the freedoms of speech, assembly, and press,\\namong other restrictions.\\nKnowing the character of the Chinese regime, Wang wrote a letter last year titled “My Declaration of Faithful Disobedience” and gave it to his congregation to publish were he ever to be imprisoned. \\nThe letter is both a defense of his faith and his actions, and is summarized in this excerpt:\\nThe Bible teaches us that, in all matters relating to the gospel and human conscience, we must obey God and not men. For this reason, spiritual disobedience and bodily suffering are both ways we testify to another eternal world and to another glorious King.\\nThis is why I am not interested in changing any political or legal institutions in China. I’m not even interested in the question of when the Communist regime’s policies persecuting the church will change. Regardless of which regime I live under now or in the future, as long as the secular government continues to persecute the church, violating human consciences that belong to God alone, I will continue my faithful disobedience. For the entire commission God has given me is to let more Chinese people know through my actions that the hope of humanity and society is only in the redemption of Christ, in the supernatural, gracious sovereignty of God.\\nAccording to Bob Fu, founder of ChinaAid, an organization that assists the persecuted church in China, “Pastor Wang’s nine-year sentence represents the harshest persecution of an ethnic Chinese house church pastor in more than a decade. … [T]he Chinese Communist Party is trying to send a chilling signal to the already-persecuted Christian community in China that unless you’re silent on the face of the evil regime, you are going to be put in jail.”\\nEarly in\\n2018, China’s President Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party put in place\\nnew regulations on religious activity in an effort to “Sinicize” or secularize\\nreligion to conform to the Chinese Communist Party’s precepts. These\\nregulations and the principle of Sinicization have amplified China’s already-severe\\npersecution of religious groups. \\nFor Christians, churches in China have been shuttered and pastors and congregants imprisoned—some even killed, like Li Baiguang. For Catholics, the Vatican has capitulated to Beijing’s demands to share control over the appointment of bishops in China. For Muslims, more than 1 million Uighurs have been arbitrarily detained in political reeducation facilities, and other Muslims are facing increasing persecution. \\nFor\\nBuddhists, Tibetans continue to face restrictions on religious\\npractice and the use of the Tibetan language. For Falun Gong, members of the\\ngroup face various forms of persecution, and some have even allegedly had their\\norgans harvested. \\nPeople of\\nall faiths are enduring persecution at the hands of the Chinese Communist Party,\\nwhich seeks to eliminate the political threat it sees from religious practice.\\nChina’s severe threats to religious freedom merit a response. The U.S. government should consider ways that it can strengthen its response to threats to religious freedom around the globe. \\nAs\\nadvocated in a recent Heritage Foundation paper, the U.S. should make ample use of\\nits human rights-based sanctions authority to hold government officials accountable\\nfor violating religious freedom. The U.S. government should also continue to\\nshine a spotlight on China at the annual Ministerial to Advance Religious\\nFreedom. \\nThese and other steps should make up part of the response to Wang’s unjust sentencing, and the broader religious freedom violations taking place in China.

       " 'The outside world can do little to assure the future of freedom in\\xa0Hong Kong\\xa0beyond making the case that preserving the principles of liberty are at stake. Nevertheless, the plight of that territory’s more than 7 million souls can teach us an important lesson about what China has in mind for the rest of the world. It is not good.\\nFor starters, the continuing protests speak volumes about China’s commitment to “one country, two systems.” When the British transferred sovereignty over Hong Kong to China in 1997, Beijing agreed to this arrangement. It guaranteed that\\xa0Hong Kong\\xa0would be allowed to maintain its own governance and economic system.\\nThe Hong Kong system—one of great economic freedom—has produced tremendous economic success. But economic freedom is no more popular than political freedom among the\\xa0Chinese Communist Party. And in recent years, Chinese authorities have been encroaching on the rights supposedly guaranteed to Hong Kongers under the “one country, two systems” agreement.\\nMatters came to a head this April, when the Hong Kong government, under heavy pressure from Beijing, introduced legislation that would allow people accused of crimes against mainland China to be extradited. The proposal set off alarms among residents who know well that the mainland’s thoroughly politicized legal system is not to be trusted.\\nFear that Beijing would quickly weaponize the proposed law to target democracy activists and journalists sparked massive protests. Efforts to suppress the demonstrations have only ignited more public demonstrations.\\nThe protests also tell us a lot about mainland China. There is one strain of thought that Beijing, while quite happy to bully Hong Kong, would not be so rash as to put down the protests with harsh military action. That kind of response repulsed the world when the Soviets did it, ultimately leading to the break-up of the USSR.\\nYet many observers fear that Beijing will step in and crack down on the demonstrators. After all, they note, the USSR’s demise didn’t stop the People’s Army from rolling tanks into Tiananmen Square.\\nThere is no question that Beijing is waging a war on nerves. Last month, it assembled troops and equipment along the border with Hong Kong. It’s also begun airing footage of troops training for suppressing riots in urban settings.\\nThis all speaks volumes about the callous cynicism with which the Chinese government treats its own people. The Hong Kong police are already doing Beijing’s dirty work for them (helped, to be fair, by protesters and agitators who have crossed the line and become violent or destructive).\\nAs long as “pro-democracy” demonstrations don’t spread to the mainland cities, Beijing might not be too concerned to see Hong Kong’s stature as a stable and dependable place to do business diminished. Hong Kong just doesn’t mean near as much to the Chinese economy as it did 20 years ago. \\nBesides, the Chinese would rather see investment flow to mainland cities like Guangzhou and Shanghai that are more firmly under the regime’s control. As for the welfare and future of the people of Hong Kong, that is the last thing Beijing cares about.\\nMost mainland Chinese seem indifferent about the protests. Many are jealous of the privileges long enjoyed by the people of Hong Kong. Rather than press for similar freedoms, they are happy to see the islanders brought down a notch. \\nThis is yet more evidence that the hope that opening up China to the world would encourage Beijing to integrate smoothly into an equitable and liberal rules-based order is little more than magical thinking.\\nFinally, there are lessons for the rest of us. China’s encroachment on Hong Kong represents yet another in a long string of promises broken by the communist regime. \\nIt has violated its commitments to U.N. Convention on the Law Seas, violated U.N. sanctions (which it voted for) against North Korea, and delivered debt and corruption (rather than the promised prosperity) through its vaunted Belt and Road economic “initiative.”\\nIn sum, Beijing has a well-deserved rep for playing fast and loose with the rules as it tries to bully its way to the top—and its actions with Hong Kong only reinforce that reputation.\\nNothing reflects the contemptuous attitude of the Chinese more than their prosperous propaganda claim that the Hong Kong demonstrations were engineered by the CIA. \\nThey know no right-thinking person in the world would believe this, but they don’t care.\\xa0They know that the people of China will accept this explanation (after all, they’ll hear no other), and that’s all they want.\\xa0\\nChina is acting like a global bully. Like most bullies, it will continue to do so—until the world stops tolerating Beijing’s intolerable behavior.\\nHong Kong is a warning to the world. The world ought to take notice.\\nOriginally published by Fox News',\n",
       " 'Anti-extradition protesters gather at Kwai Fong MTR station in Hong Kong on Aug. 20. (Photo: Lillian Suwanrumpha/AFP/Getty Images)\\nPro-democracy protests in Hong Kong continue as China flexes its muscles and warns of an intervention. Today, we feature an exclusive interview with Alvin Yeung, a politician from Hong Kong who supports the protests and hopes to achieve reforms. Read the interview, posted below, or listen on the podcast:\\nWe also cover these stories:\\nThe Daily Signal podcast is available on\\xa0Ricochet,\\xa0iTunes,\\xa0SoundCloud,\\xa0Google Play, or\\xa0Stitcher.

You can also leave us a message at 202-608-6205 or write us at\\xa0[email\\xa0protected].\\xa0Enjoy the show!\\nDaniel Davis: We’re joined now over the phone by Alvin Yeung. He is an elected representative from Hong Kong where he leads the pro-democracy Civic Party and is a member of the Legislative Council. \\nMr. Yeung, thanks so much for your time today.\\nAlvin Yeung:\\xa0\\xa0Hello. Thank you for having me.\\nDavis:\\xa0We’ve been following the recent protests in Hong Kong as they’ve developed, but I wanted to take a step back first and get some context. \\nYou’re an elected member of Hong Kong’s legislative body, where the extradition bill was originally proposed and then tabled. Can you explain for us why that bill was able to be proposed if it turned out to be so unpopular?\\nYeung:\\xa0Audience from America have to understand the fact that the Hong Kong legislature is not entirely democratic as it sounds. \\nHalf of the legislature was returned by geographical “one person, one vote” system, and that’s where I come from. But the other half of it comes from something called functional constituencies and they are representatives from different industries like the banking, legal, medical, etc. And some of them have corporate votes. \\nNot everybody working in a bank gets a vote to vote for their banking representative, but only those bankers or the people who actually own a bank get to vote. \\nSo there’s this inequality in the system, and when the government enjoys a majority because of that system, they would count the votes and they think they could just go ahead on anything controversial.\\nKate Trinko:\\xa0Of course we’ve all been following these massive protests, and is the main thing at seat the extradition bill? Or are there other issues, other demands, from the protesters of things they want to see changed?\\nYeung:\\xa0At the beginning, people in Hong Kong took to the street to protest against this highly controversial extradition bill, but shortly after we understand that it goes way beyond the bill, it’s the system itself. \\nThe system cannot reflect what people really want. When the chief executive is not being elected by the people, when half of the legislature is not being elected by the people, then we demand democracy. We demand the fact that we have a right to directly elect, and choose, the chief executive and the full legislature.\\nTrinko: And are there any other demands that the protesters are looking to get?\\nYeung:\\xa0We are demanding the government to stop prosecuting people who participated in all these protests over the past two and a half months. We’re also demanding the government to withdraw their labeling of this protest as rioting. This is just plainly wrong.\\nDavis:\\xa0Is there a path toward that kind of reform you’re looking for? What’s the strategy going forward?\\nYeung:\\xa0Right now the ball is in the court of the Hong Kong government and Beijing. If they really treasure Hong Kong, especially this very special city, then they have to understand that what Hong Kong people are demanding is not something so unreasonable. \\nWe are not asking for the moon. We are simply asking for something that was promised by Beijing, as stated clearly in the Basic Law, Basic Law is our mini constitution.\\nTrinko:\\xa0How does your party, and other politicians in your party, feel about the protests right now?\\nYeung:\\xa0We understand that Hong Kong people are so united, we stand in solidarity. Over the past weekend or two, we saw Hong Kong immigrants protesting around the world in support of Hong Kong people. We understand that the world is watching and we are also asking the world, the international community, to continue paying attention in support of Hong Kong people’s peaceful demonstrations.\\nDavis:\\xa0We’ve seen reports that the Chinese military is doing drills in Shenzhen, right across from Hong Kong. How would you, and your political allies, respond if China decided to intervene?\\nYeung:\\xa0We do have a fear that the army, or the armed police, would be deployed to Hong Kong. But again, this is why we are asking the international community to continue paying attention to Hong Kong. \\nNever forget Hong Kong is not an ordinary city of China. We are not in isolation. Hong Kong is an international financial city. … The United States has huge amounts, billions of dollars, of investments and 85,000 United States nationals working or living in Hong Kong. So that would not only affect and harm Hong Kong, that will also harm the rest of the world who has a stake in Hong Kong. \\nI just hope that Beijing would have the wisdom not to deploy troops in Hong Kong, because that will end “one country, two systems.”\\nTrinko: There’s been concerns, particularly with this action from China, that this could end up being another Tiananmen Square. Do you think that that analogy makes sense or do you reject it?\\nYeung:\\xa0Again, I do share that fear that Hong Kong will become another Tiananmen Square, but then again, I have to repeat this, we are now in 2019, it’s not 1989. \\nHong Kong is not another Tiananmen for the simple fact that we are an open society, the world is watching, we are well-connected to the rest of the world. Anything that happens in Hong Kong would be seen in everyone’s TV screen or phone screen within seconds. So if Beijing dares to really risk the special status of Hong Kong, then it would be extremely wrong to them.\\nDavis: And of course so much of this … comes in the context of the 50-year window between the handover in 1997 and 2047, when Hong Kong is scheduled to return fully to the Chinese system. \\nHow do you, and your political allies, look toward the future looking at that 2047 deadline? Would you like to see it delayed or some alternative future?\\nYeung:\\xa0We are working very hard to lay foundations for the future negotiation with Beijing if that ever happens. That we wish to see Hong Kong stays unique, we wish to see Hong Kong stay as a member of liberal democracy. That the values that we share with the rest of the world, at least the Western world, that freedom of speech can be upheld, that we can still have free elections. Although these are the things that we are facing challenges with. \\nRight now Hong Kong is under challenge on all different fronts, but then we are urging the rest of the world to pay attention to Hong Kong, so that we can continue to enjoy the freedoms that we were supposed to have.\\nTrinko:\\xa0Have you been able to participate in any of these protests yourself?\\nYeung:\\xa0Yes, I have been joining different protests, or standing at the forefront. Not all of them, but most of them.\\nTrinko:\\xa0What is the experience like? What are people saying? How long are they out there? I think it’s just extraordinary. I believe one of them had 1 out of every 7 people in Hong Kong there. Those numbers are just unheard of. What is it like on the ground when you’re there?\\nYeung:\\xa0Yeah. I have to tell our audience here that Hong Kong has around 7 million people of population, but in early June we had 1 million people take to the street in opposition to the bill. And one week later, we had 2 million people take to the streets. And over the past two and a half months, we have all different kinds of protests or demonstrations against police brutality, against the fact that this government is not listening. \\nMost recently, in the last weekend, we had 1.7 million people take to the streets in a peaceful manner, under the rain, to tell the rest of the world—and of course the Hong Kong and Beijing government—that all we are asking for is, No. 1, democracy, and No.2,  a formal withdrawal of the bill and investigation of police misconduct.\\nDavis:\\xa0We’ve seen so many of those powerful images and even videos of protesters recently waving American flags and singing “The Star-Spangled Banner.” What role should the United States be playing in this, if at all?\\nYeung:\\xa0I’m here in the United States right now while we are talking to have a Hong Kong-U.S. dialogue with a U.S. congressman and senator. And we are telling our friends here to continue paying attention to Hong Kong, as Hong Kong is not standing in isolation. \\nWe are at a forefront of two different ideas, that is the liberal democracies ideas, and we are facing one of the biggest authoritarian states on Earth. So Hong Kong cannot stay alone. We need support, at least moral support, or any kind of support, from the rest of the world so that we understand we are not fighting this fight just on our own.\\nTrinko: Is there anything else that we didn’t ask you about that you think Americans should know?\\nYeung:\\xa0I appreciate the attention, and care, and support paid by Americans over the past two and a half months. I just wish that that could continue because we need support from the rest of the world, especially those from the United States of America.\\nDavis:\\xa0All right. Alvin Yeung, thank you so much for your time today.\\nYeung:\\xa0Thank you very much.',\n",

       " 'It was not a happy Thanksgiving for President Donald Trump’s detractors, as the president showed with his surprise trip Thursday to Afghanistan that “America First” is not a code term for isolationism.\\nTrump’s visit with U.S. troops, his meeting with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, and his announcement that the U.S. has reopened peace talks with the Taliban showed that America is in anything but retreat.\\nBy now, it should be clear to everyone that accusations claiming Trump is really an isolationist are bogus.\\nMost recently, when Trump announced a shift in Syria policy, he was accused of “abandoning the Middle East.” Over time, the facts on the ground didn’t bear that out.\\nNow we know that the U.S. brokered a cease-fire between Syrian and Kurdish forces that undoubtedly helped avoid needless bloodshed. America continues to fight the Islamic State terrorist group and work with the Kurds, and no adversary has realized any real gains from the shift in the U.S. footprint.\\nStill think the isolationist label sticks to Trump? How does that square with his action in signing legislation supporting the people of Hong Kong in their struggle with China?\\nNow the U.S. is on record to support the effort of Hong Kongers to retain the political and economic freedoms that Beijing promised to honor when Britain returned Hong Kong to Chinese control.\\nTrump faced tremendous pressure from Beijing to veto that legislation. He didn’t. That doesn’t jibe with the notion that the president wants to turn his back on the free world.\\nTrump’s trip to Afghanistan was yet another reminder that he is willing to go to the ends of the Earth to protect America’s interests. Keeping the Taliban from overrunning Afghanistan is key to peace and stability in South Asia, and to blocking a resurgence of the likes of al-Qaeda.\\nTrump differs from his predecessors in that he seeks neither to solve all the world’s problems nor to ignore legitimate threats to U.S. interests. What he is trying to do is establish a credible and sustainable global footprint that makes clear to adversaries that the U.S. is no pushover and it doesn’t intend to become one.\\nTo that end, Trump has pushed friends and allies to bear their fair share of the peace-and-stability load. He has pushed U.S. forces forward not to fight endless wars or act as the world’s policeman, but to safeguard our interests and partner with those who share our vision for a peaceful, prosperous global space.\\nAfghanistan is a case in point for what can be called the Trump Doctrine. Trump shifted the mission of U.S. forces there from fighting a war to providing advice and support for the Afghan people. He made a commitment to stick it out. And he offered the Taliban an off-ramp from the conflict.\\nIf the Taliban are willing to talk peace with the Afghan government, then the U.S. is willing to talk, too—but all the while, America will continue to provide military support for the Afghan government and conduct counterterrorism operations.\\nTrump has made similar offers to all of America’s competitors: Iran, Russia, China, and North Korea.\\nThe president’s trip to Afghanistan demonstrates his continued resolve to follow through. No doubt, Trump was also pleased to spend time with the troops he loves—and to let them know how thankful he and the entire country are for their service and sacrifice.\\nThe Trump Doctrine—and any responsible foreign policy—cannot succeed without our courageous men and women in uniform. The president clearly appreciates their patriotism and all they do for our country.\\nOriginally published by Fox News',\n",
       " 'What a difference a decade makes.\\nIn 2010, we got the\\xa0Arab Spring\\xa0and\\xa0Obamacare. Neither turned out as well as we had hoped.\\nWe got\\xa0iPads, iPhone 4, and Angry Birds. Tech has definitely moved on.\\nWhat about America’s foreign policy?\\xa0It had its ups and downs. Here is a list of the top 10 foreign policy hits and misses of the decade.\\n1.\\xa0Hit. Sticking It\\xa0Out in Afghanistan (2010)\\xa0\\nAfter coming into office, one of President Barack Obama’s first big foreign policy challenges was to decide what to do about the war in Afghanistan. In 2010, he surged U.S. forces, turning around a rapidly deteriorating situation. Equally important, he started a transition from an American-led effort to building an Afghan military that could take up the responsibility for defending the Afghan people.\\xa0\\nPresident\\xa0Donald Trump has followed through, and after this next drawdown, U.S. force levels in Afghanistan will be about what they were when Obama left office.\\nOverall, the U.S. effort in Afghanistan has served American interests well. The region is far more stable now. The Taliban are not winning, and the Afghan government seems in no danger of collapse. The likes of al-Qaeda and ISIS no longer can use it as a sanctuary or a platform for global terrorism. As long as this condition prevails, we win.\\n2. Miss.\\xa0Pulling Out of Iraq (2011)\\xa0\\nYou could make a case that invading Iraq was the wrong move. And there’s an even stronger case to be made that the subsequent occupation—poorly planned and sloppily executed—was even worse. Yet the situation Obama inherited there in 2008 was at least manageable. Unfortunately, he made it worse.\\nHe made no\\xa0serious effort to get a status of forces agreement to keep U.S.\\xa0troops in the country.\\xa0Instead, he\\xa0rapidly\\xa0withdrew American forces and influence in 2011, triggering\\xa0a free-for-all\\xa0that ended in\\xa0political fragmentation, the rise of ISIS,\\xa0the\\xa0near-collapse of\\xa0the\\xa0Iraqi military, and\\xa0a\\xa0surge of Iranian meddling.\\xa0We are still coping with the aftermath.\\n3.\\xa0Hit. Killing Bin Laden (2011)\\xa0\\nObama deserves full credit for taking out the mastermind of the 9/11 terrorist attacks and effectively capping the war on global terrorism. No, the threat of global Islamist terrorism isn’t eradicated completely. But the U.S. has continued to deal with that threat effectively throughout the decade.\\n4. Miss.\\xa0Bungling Benghazi (2012)\\xa0\\nAfter abandoning his famous “red line” in Syria, Obama planned to save face with a lead-from-behind campaign to liberate Libya. So enamored with his light-touch foreign policy, his administration refused to acknowledge, let alone address, a spiraling security situation that resulted in the tragic and needless death of Americans, including the U.S. ambassador. The debacle seemed to make the Obama administration even more risk-averse when it came to standing up for America’s interests around the world.\\n5. Miss. Iran\\xa0Deal\\xa0(2013)\\xa0\\nObama brokered the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, claiming it would solve the problem of Iran as a nuclear threat and instigator-in-chief of Middle Eastern instability. It didn’t. \\nArmed with boatloads of cash and the chaos wrought by ISIS in Syria and Iraq, Iran mobilized its surrogates—Hamas, Islamic Jihad, the Houthi rebels in Yemen, Hezbollah, and the Shia militias in Iraq.\\xa0As a result,\\xa0the\\xa0entire region was far worse off when Obama left office than when he was sworn in. And the problems weren’t just in the Middle East. A rising China, a restive Russia, and a belligerent North Korea were also threatening vital U.S. interests—and they continue to do so today.\\n6.\\xa0Miss.\\xa0Playing\\xa0Pals\\xa0With Putin (2018)\\xa0\\nIn 2016, it was hard to make sense of Trump’s\\xa0“America First” pledge. It may have worked as a campaign slogan, but it told us nothing about his foreign policy. In 2017, he published a sound\\xa0national security strategy\\xa0addressing all the big problems, yet folks debated whether the president supported his own foreign policy blueprint.\\nHe did himself\\xa0no\\xa0favors with his first NATO\\xa0meeting\\xa0and a subsequent press conference with Russian strongman Vladimir Putin.\\xa0Afterward, the administration spent weeks reassuring\\xa0people\\xa0that\\xa0the U.S.\\xa0wasn’t leaving NATO, lifting sanctions on Russia, or selling out Ukraine. \\nFolks had a hard time distinguishing between “Showman Trump,” who made all kinds of outrageous public comments for all kinds of reasons,\\xa0and “Serious Trump,” who delivered\\xa0sound decisions and policies in America’s interests.\\n7.\\xa0Hit. Crushing\\xa0the Caliphate (2018)\\xa0\\nTrump showed there was a serious leader behind the showman when he doubled down on defeating ISIS as decisively and quickly as possible. So long, risk-averse foreign policy; hello, self-assured, decisive action. The U.S. continues to press a global campaign against Islamist terror threats, most notably by hunting down\\xa0Baghdadi, the head of the crushed caliphate, and\\xa0bin Laden’s son.\\n8.\\xa0Hit. Withdrawing From\\xa0INF\\xa0(2019)\\xa0\\nBy pulling out of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, Trump served notice that the U.S. was now committed to facing the world’s problems rather than turning a blind eye to them. The Obama administration had tried to ignore Putin’s cheating; Trump just pulled the plug.\\nIt wasn’t the only stiff-arm the U.S. gave Russia. Trump gave arms to Ukraine,\\xa0increased military support to Europe,\\xa0kept\\xa0up the sanctions\\xa0on Moscow,\\xa0and backed\\xa0NATO enlargement. He did exactly everything Putin hated.\\nThat tough love approach carried over elsewhere—from Iran to North Korea (“maximum pressure”) to Beijing (trade war and more). His basic message was simple: America is a pushover no more. After three years, it was clear Trump had a solid plan for dealing with problems around the world.\\n9.\\xa0Miss. Explaining Syria\\xa0(2019)\\xa0\\nWhile Trump’s policies had more hits than misses, not so his rhetorical talents. His explanation of the U.S. response to Turkey’s incursion in Syria created chaos. While the\\xa0predictions of disaster were proved wrong, much of the outrage and anxiety could have been avoided by responsible explaining.\\n10. Hit.\\xa0NATO’s\\xa0London\\xa0Meeting\\xa0(2019)\\xa0\\nYou know that Trump rocked it at the NATO meeting because the best his detractors could muster was “small ball” carping. In contrast, his accomplishments were real: promoting increased investment in NATO,\\xa0focusing attention on the China threat,\\xa0and emphasizing the strategic importance of space. \\nTrump has pressed our allies to do more, even as he has led the U.S. to strengthen our own military and increase military sales to allied and friendly nations—in every key theater.\\nAdding up the plus and minuses, it is hard to argue the U.S. isn’t better off than when the decade\\xa0began. While Trump doesn’t earn\\xa0Obama’s\\xa0style points, he has done more to keep America free, safe, and prosperous—and\\xa0it doesn’t look like impeachment is slowing him down.\\nOriginally published by Fox News',\n",
       " 'It’s fine for astrologers and bookmakers to make predictions, but there’s no absolute certainty about what the future holds. That’s true regarding matters of\\xa0national security—and there the stakes are truly high.\\nConsider\\xa0Iran. There is no more risky business than predicting when an authoritarian regime will collapse under the weight of its own putrefaction. Natan Sharansky has an excellent explanation of this phenomenon in his book “The Case for Democracy” (2004).\\nBy their nature, he notes, these\\xa0regimes\\xa0are opaque. Their leaders hide the truth from the outside world, their own people—even from each other. \\nAt the same time, they control every element of governance, civil society, the economy, the military, and the media. This makes it really hard to see the cracks that eventually lead to failure and collapse.\\nMoreover, there are no relief mechanisms that allow for accommodation, dissent, and change. When under assault from without and within, these regimes can\\xa0roil with a furious boil until the pressure cooker explodes—a catastrophic failure that takes many by surprise.\\nHow close the Tehran regime is to condition red is anybody’s guess. Today it faces the authoritarian’s worst nightmare: intense pressure from the outside and the inside.\\nThuggish regimes excel at handling one or the other. When pressed from without, they rally the people and even use the external threat as a pretext for clamping down on dissent even more harshly. When threatened from within, they ruthlessly suppress opposition voices. \\nBut\\xa0when these regimes are hammered from both directions simultaneously, they struggle.\\nToday, Tehran is being jackhammered—and not just by the Trump administration. The foreign ministries of Germany, the United Kingdom,\\xa0and France have joined in calling out the regime for non-compliance with the Iran nuclear deal\\xa0and denouncing the regime’s actions as unacceptable. \\nIran is on its way to more crippling “snap-back” sanctions.\\nMeanwhile, inside Iran, the natives are more than restless. Perhaps the most stunning clue of how times have changed from the revolution of 1979 is the stunning video of Iranian students streaming down the street, deliberately refusing to walk over images of the American and Israeli flags on the sidewalk. \\nWho would have thought we would have seen such a thing in our lifetimes? It may not be quite as startling as taking a sledgehammer to the Berlin Wall, but it is nonetheless stunning.\\nThe protesters aren’t the only challenges the regime faces. Iran’s economy is bottoming out. Its surrogate military forces—bringing death and instability from Syria to Yemen, Iraq, and more—are now under assault themselves throughout the greater Middle East. And its supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, is no spring chicken. \\nNo one expects the octogenarian ayatollah\\xa0to hang on that much longer—and the smart money says a leadership struggle will follow his passing.\\nBut this is not to say that freedom is just around the corner in Iran.\\nThis is a tough bunch of mullahs. They have sustained the revolution for nearly a half-century and show no signs of letting up or losing control. They have doubled down on suppressing internal dissent and are as recalcitrant as ever in their stand-off with President Donald Trump.\\nOdds are the government won’t just collapse, nor will Iran\\xa0turn overnight into a “normal” nation like Norway, as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pines for. \\nThe most likely scenario is the regime turns a little risk-averse, metering its foreign adventurism so it can focus on stabilizing its internal security. That is what the regime has done in the past when the revolution felt squeezed.\\nStill, there is no telling what steps or missteps Iran may take—and the U.S. shouldn’t try to guess. The consequences of guessing wrong could be really bad.\\nThe best course now is for Trump to stick to his current strategy, for the simple reason that it is the one best calculated to safeguard U.S. interests. \\nThe U.S. should not press for regime change. For one, it’s not clear that’s an achievable goal. For another, it is far from clear what would come after. There would likely be a whole new set of challenges.\\nIf the Iranian people opt for regime change (and who could blame them?), that’s their business. The people of Iran have a perfect right to cry “freedom.” If they throw the mullahs out, we and the rest of the world will just have to deal with the aftermath.\\nIf the regime hangs on, the mullahs will have to learn to live with being a pariah state, or they will have to take the bold choice of taking Pompeo’s advice and joining the family of responsible nations.\\nOriginally published by Fox News.',\n",
       " '“Thank you for your service.” Our troops hear that often from their fellow Americans, and not just during the holidays. Well, our gratitude can go even deeper. We also can be thankful that our military isn’t fighting “endless wars.”\\nCalls for “no more endless wars” may be catchy, but they’re a bumper-stick excuse for a serious foreign policy. \\nSure, there are many intractable conflicts around the world. But that’s not what defines America’s military deployments. And if President Donald Trump’s critics could look at the facts on the ground, free from political bias, they would see that his administration has done an excellent job aligning America’s global footprint with U.S. national interests.\\nThe White House has drawn the most criticism for its operations in Syria, which without question will remain a fractured country plagued with instability and conflict for years to come. \\nThis, simply put, is not our war. That didn’t stop critics from assailing the president. Nor did they retract their criticism when it became clear that while we aren’t planning on being a party to the conflict, we aren’t walking away from our responsibility, either.\\nThe U.S. is adjusting its presence to continue the fight against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, and positively contribute to minimizing conflict that affects friends and allies. What the president is doing throughout the Middle East is transitioning to a more sustainable posture, one that equitably shares the burdens while keeping the pressure on ISIS and Iran, the chief destabilizing threats in the region.\\nIn a similar manner, the U.S. is still in Afghanistan. But we aren’t fighting a war. We are, along with our NATO allies, providing advice and support to the Afghan people, who are defending themselves.\\nAfghans don’t want to live under the oppression of the Taliban. Supporting them is not only a noble mission, it serves U.S interests. If the Taliban overran Afghanistan again, we would be right back to the dangerous conditions we faced on 9/11.\\nIn Western Europe, this administration actually has increased America’s military might—not to fight a war, but to deter a future one. And it’s hard to argue with success. Under Trump’s watch, not one more inch of European soil has fallen into Russian President Vladimir Putin’s grasp. That’s a record that can’t be matched by the past two presidents.\\nIn Asia, China is undergoing an unprecedented military expansion. No one outside Beijing thinks that’s going to make the world a safer place. There’s no question that the U.S., in concert with its allies, needs to step up and counter this expansion. \\nThat’s far from warmongering. Support for the effort is also truly bipartisan, recognizing America has to do more to ensure its future as an Indo-Pacific power.\\nIn other places around the world, our troops are deployed in numbers large and small. They aren’t looking for a fight. They aren’t looking to own a square foot of soil. They are there because America is a global power with global responsibilities.\\nOur troops aren’t the world’s policemen, but they are looking after our interests around the world. They are part of America’s most important export, a force for peace and stability.\\nSo as we remember our troops this holiday season—as they often experience about as much comfort as the exhausted, ragged Continental Army did when heading for its winter camp in Valley Forge—let’s remember exactly why we should be grateful.',\n",
       " 'The case of Navy SEAL Chief Petty Officer Eddie Gallagher, which\\nultimately resulted in the firing of Navy Secretary Richard Spencer, should\\nhave been handled differently.\\xa0 \\nThe prosecution mishandled the case, President Donald Trump intervened prematurely, and the Navy secretary got caught between trying to do the right thing, an unorthodox president, and keeping the defense secretary in the loop. \\nThe case highlights a number of red flags, each of which we highlight below, and unless and until those issues are resolved, the fiasco that was the Gallagher case is likely to repeat itself.\\xa0It didn’t have to end this way, and should be a lesson going forward.\\nBefore getting into the specifics of the Gallagher case,\\nlet’s start with the basics.\\nUnder our constitutional framework, the president is the commander\\nin chief of the U.S. armed forces. Civilian control over the military is a\\nstrength and distinguishing feature of our democratic republic. The secretary\\nof defense, a Cabinet-level officer appointed by the president, is the senior\\nDefense Department civilian in day-to-day charge of the military. Effective\\ndefense secretaries maintain close ties to the president, especially during\\ntimes of war or ongoing military operations, like those we have today.\\xa0 \\nAs we have written\\nelsewhere, the military exists to defend the nation. To accomplish that\\nmission, leaders must ensure that those who serve under them are combat-ready,\\nand once ordered into armed conflict, combat-effective. Maintaining good order\\nand disci\\xadpline in the armed forces is essential to accomplish\\xading the mission.\\n\\nThe United States military justice system is integral to the\\nmilitary’s mission. It is unique, and for good reason. Unlike the civilian\\njustice system, which exists solely to enforce the laws of the juris\\xaddiction\\nand punish wrongdoers, our military justice system exists in\\norder to help the military to succeed in its mission to defend the nation. \\nIt is structured so that those in charge, commanding\\nofficers, can carry out the orders of their civilian leaders. Ultimately, it is\\nstructured to fight and win wars. It does so in accordance with rules or laws\\nto which the U.S. has agreed, so as to minimize the extremes and horrific\\nabuses to which war can drive people as was experienced in the two world wars.\\nThroughout our nation’s history, there have been isolated instances\\nwhere U.S. service members have been accused of violating the laws of war. Fortunately,\\nthose cases have been few and far between, as almost every soldier, sailor, airman,\\nand Marine carry out their duties honorably and follow the rules, even under\\ntremendously difficult circumstances.\\xa0 \\nWhen breaches of discipline or law do happen, there is\\nusually an investigation. If investigated properly, and if there is evidence of\\na potential crime, the service member (who is presumed innocent under the law)\\nmay be sent to a court-martial (a criminal trial), but not until he is afforded\\na free attorney and due process.\\nThese cases are handled within the military justice system, and it is rare that they come to the attention of a president. In high-profile cases, the press may write stories about the case, and Congress may take an interest in it, but for the most part, the system of justice methodically proceeds step-by-step through the finest military justice system in the world, with all the procedural protections built into the system.\\xa0 \\nWhen the commander in chief does become aware of high-profile\\ncases, it has been the practice and custom for presidents to let the process run\\nits course, as there is no guarantee how any case will turn out.\\xa0 \\nPresidents in the past have weighed in to commute a sentence or pardon a service member, but they usually wait until after the case has run its course, for good reason. A president is not required to wait, but it is usually the prudent thing to do, as it sends the obvious message to all that process matters, that the commander in chief understands and appreciates the need to maintain good order and discipline in the armed forces, and that the system itself is to be trusted.\\xa0 \\nThat’s not to say that when past presidents have waited, and then acted, that those actions have been popular with the military—or the public, for that matter. President Barack Obama’s commutation of Pvt. Chelsea Manning’s sentence from 35 years to a mere seven years was highly controversial, and unwarranted, in our opinion. \\nManning was convicted and sentenced by a military judge for disclosing more than 800,000 classified documents to WikiLeaks, which in turn published that trove of documents, causing untold damage to our national security.\\nObama claimed he commuted Manning’s sentence because it was disproportionate to the crimes committed, and when compared with other leakers’ sentences.\\xa0As we have written, we disagreed with that rationale, as there was no other leaker nearly as profligate as Manning in American history.\\xa0 \\nGiven the vast amount of actual battlefield experience accumulated by many within our military, there is a keen understanding of the incredibly difficult choices fellow warriors have to make. They (1) are presumed to know the rules of engagement; (2) are presumed to have followed those rules, and (3) are given the benefit of the doubt when it is a close call. That is what we should expect from the profession of arms; namely, experienced warriors making prudent decisions based on all available information.\\nAll of which brings us to Trump and the Gallagher case.\\nFor starters, Navy SEALs are amazing warriors. They are highly intelligent, exquisitely trained, deeply experienced special operators. SEALs are routinely tasked with missions that are incredibly dangerous, fluid in nature, and require strength, intelligence, stamina, courage, patience, sagacity, and teamwork.\\xa0Most Americans would be hard-pressed to fully understand the challenges and pressures faced daily by our Navy SEALs.\\xa0 \\nBut SEALs are human, and like the rest of us, they make mistakes.\\xa0Most mistakes are minor, but some can be significant. And while it is understandable on one level that mistakes will happen, given the repeated combat tours and high-stress environment that SEALs work in, SEALs are not immune from the rules. When they violate them, they must be held to account.\\nIn 2017, Gallagher, a decorated SEAL, was on his eighth combat tour in Afghanistan when he is alleged to have committed various crimes. He was charged with premeditated murder, aggravated assault, assault with a dangerous weapon, wrongful use and possession of controlled substances, obstructing justice, and wrongfully posing for a picture with the corpse of an ISIS fighter, along with some other minor charges for actions he allegedly took in Iraq in 2017. \\nFinding sufficient cause to bring the case to trial, the\\nconvening authority within Gallagher’s chain of command did so in 2018, an\\nentire year after the alleged crime. By then, the case had grown cold, and\\ncritical evidence had not been preserved for the trial. \\nTo make matters worse, the original prosecutor in the case,\\na Navy commander, was dismissed by the military judge for unethical behavior. A\\njunior prosecutor took over the case and called other SEALs as witnesses in the\\ncase against Gallagher, including those who were at the scene of the death of\\nthe ISIS fighter and, therefore, had firsthand knowledge of what took place.\\xa0 \\nOne of those witnesses was Special Warfare Operator 1st Class Corey Scott, to whom the prosecution gave immunity in exchange for his testimony against Gallagher.\\xa0The immunity deal came back to bite the government, because at trial, Scott testified that, contrary to the allegation that Gallagher had stabbed the prisoner to death, Scott himself had blocked the prisoner’s breathing tube and killed him as an act of mercy.\\xa0\\xa0 \\nThe military jury acquitted Gallagher of the murder charge, and all other charges, except for posing with a corpse, finding him guilty of the latter offense.\\xa0They sentenced him to four months’ confinement, and reduced him in rank by one pay grade. Since Gallagher had already served 201 days in pretrial confinement, he was given credit for time served and was released from confinement. \\nAfter his conviction, Gallagher was still in the Navy. The\\nSEAL leadership had to decide what to do with a sailor with a court-martial\\nconviction. In a normal case, Navy leaders would have sent the case to an\\nadministrative discharge board, and that panel of three officers would decide\\nwhether to fire the sailor from the Navy or let him continue to serve. But\\ngiven presidential, congressional, and media interest, this was no ordinary\\ncase.\\nSenior Navy leaders decided that Gallagher should go before a Trident Review Board (a panel of SEALs) who would decide whether he should keep his Trident, the distinctive badge earned by SEALs. \\nThe question was whether Gallagher’s conduct was sufficiently bad as to bring discredit on the special operations community—the SEALs in particular—such that his expulsion from the SEALs (but not the Navy) was warranted. \\nThis would have been far from unprecedented. Trident Review\\nBoards have reviewed, and removed, Tridents from more than 150 SEALs in recent\\nyears.\\nWhen the members of Gallagher’s savvy defense team learned that their client might lose his Trident pin, they worked the media, especially Fox News, to drum up support for their client.\\nAn avid consumer of media reporting, especially Fox News, Trump\\ntweeted on Nov. 21, “The Navy will NOT be taking\\naway Warfighter and Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher’s Trident pin. This case was\\nhandled very badly from the beginning. Get back to business!” That tweet,\\ncoming from the commander in chief, was Trump’s unorthodox way of giving an\\norder to the Navy: Don’t send Gallagher to a Trident Review Board.\\xa0 \\nOther presidents probably would have waited to see what the Trident Review Board did before acting. Trident Review Boards are composed of fellow SEALs, who sit in judgment of fellow SEALs, and decide whether or not to allow their shipmates to keep their Tridents, given the alleged misconduct.\\xa0 \\nBut Trump acted on instinct and put a halt to the board\\nbefore it could take place, depriving the SEALs of the opportunity to weigh in\\non their shipmate’s conduct. Some see this as a character flaw in the president;\\nnamely, a consistent habit of acting impulsively, even recklessly. Others see his\\nunorthodox and quick decisions as a welcome breath of fresh air, a president\\nwho takes action rather than dither or be hostage to long, drawn-out,\\nbureaucratic processes.\\xa0 \\nIt is clear that Trump believed, like many Americans, that\\nGallagher had gone through enough, that he had been exonerated of the worst\\ncharges, that he had served his country bravely and with honor for many years,\\nand that further action against him needed to end.\\xa0 \\nWe believe in an orderly process, and that to maintain good\\norder and discipline, following the process was paramount and should have\\nhappened.\\nTrump’s actions put Spencer, the Navy secretary, in a tough\\nspot. As a former Marine, he knew maintaining good order and discipline is key\\nto an effective fighting force and that process mattered. But he also knew that\\nthe president wanted the Navy to halt the Trident Review Board (and quite\\npossibly an administrative discharge board if that followed). \\nSpencer tried to satisfy everyone involved by crafting a deal with\\nthe White House that would allow for Gallagher to retire from the SEALs if\\nTrump stayed out of the case.\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\nThe problem was that Spencer had told senior defense officials, according to The Washington Post, that he was considering resigning if Trump forced the issue, implying that he would stand against the president’s directive in order to allow the process to move forward without interference. But this side deal could only be interpreted as Spencer trying to get the president what he wanted—an honorable exit for Gallagher—even if the review board concluded otherwise. \\nIt was, as others have called it, a\\n“sham review process with a preordained outcome.” Further, the side deal was\\noffered in secret, without the knowledge of the secretary of defense, something\\nSecretary Mark Esper could not let go unaddressed. When the defense secretary\\nfound out about Spencer’s side deal, he got Trump’s permission to fire Spencer.\\xa0 \\xa0\\nWhen Obama commuted the sentence of Manning, it sent a loud\\nand clear message that leaking millions of classified documents to WikiLeaks\\nwas not that serious, even though the publication of those documents has been\\ndescribed by senior intelligence officials as the most damaging leak of\\nnational security secrets in our nation’s history. \\nAt least Obama commuted the sentence the old-fashioned way: He\\nlet the process play out until conviction, and then acted. He acted,\\nconsequences be damned.\\nGallagher is no Manning—far from it. Gallagher is not a war\\ncriminal, as some have suggested, but he was convicted of posing with a corpse\\nafter an investigation and flawed prosecution. The president had every right to\\nweigh in and let Gallagher keep his Trident, especially given the way the case\\nwas handled from the beginning. \\xa0\\nBut how the president handled this, and other recent\\nmilitary cases, also warrants review and, in our opinion, criticism. It would\\nhave been far better for the president to allow the judicial and review\\nprocesses to play out to make it clear that the military’s legal system is\\ninherently good and can be trusted, even when it bungles a case on rare\\noccasion. \\nIt would have also sent the message to the military that\\nevery individual and his or her actions are subject to review, judging them\\naccording to standards of behavior essential to good order and the values we\\nhold dear as Americans, but also accounting for the circumstances of war as\\nappropriate.\\xa0 \\nWhen the few service members who violate the military’s Uniform Code of Military Justice are convicted by a jury of their peers, and their convictions are upheld on appeal, you’re not “sticking up for the military” by pardoning them. Such action can be interpreted as excusing criminal behavior, undermining the system, and eroding good order and discipline in the armed forces. \\xa0\\nPardoning military members should be a sober, thoughtful,\\nand judicious act, one untainted by even the perception of political self-interest.\\xa0 \\nThe military justice system isn’t perfect, but it is very,\\nvery good and has a lengthy history of dispensing true justice fairly and in\\naccordance with American values, legal protections, and the imperative of\\nhaving a military that is effective in war while disciplined in its conduct of\\nwar.\\nThis specific case was handled poorly from the beginning. But\\nthis episode should act as a reminder that good order and discipline in the\\narmed forces can only be achieved when people follow the rules and procedures. \\nIf and when the commander in chief wants to exercise\\nexecutive leniency, it is best done after serious consultation with senior\\nmilitary officials, and after the process has run its course, and only when\\nleniency is deserved.\\xa0 \\xa0',\n",
       " \"Jack Spencer\\n\\nJack Spencer oversees The Heritage Foundation's research on a range of domestic economic and trade issues as vice president for the think tank's Institute for Economic Freedom and Opportunity.\\nPresident Donald Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He on Wednesday signed Phase 1 of the U.S.-China Economic and Trade Agreement.\\nThe long-awaited deal is the result of two years of tough trade negotiations between Washington and Beijing. \\nOver this period, new taxes have\\nbeen placed on hundreds of billions of traded goods across the Pacific as the\\nU.S.-China trade war escalated. This led American importers to pay roughly $43\\nbillion in new taxes, not to mention the cost to American farmers of losing market\\naccess to China.\\xa0\\nNow, the new Phase 1 deal takes a significant step toward normalizing the U.S.-China trade relationship as it’s easily the most comprehensive agreement our countries have signed since China’s entry into the World Trade Organization.\\nAmerican companies’ access to China’s\\nmarket, the protection of their intellectual property rights, and ability to do\\nbusiness free from Chinese government coercion long has been a concern of the\\nTrump administration. \\nThe Phase 1 deal attempts to address these concerns by implementing procedures to protect American intellectual property and stopping the forced transfer of trade secrets to Chinese entities.\\nThe agreement also opens up new\\nopportunities for U.S. farm and agriculture exporters by removing nontariff\\nbarriers to China’s market.\\nThe deal includes commitments by China to increase its purchases of U.S. agriculture, manufactured, and energy goods and services by $200 billion over two years. \\nAlthough the agreement attempts to shift China’s political economy to a more market-based one, free from government intervention, there is nothing market-based about these government-directed purchases.\\nThe Phase 1 deal, while not perfect, is a step in the right direction and we should welcome the swift conclusion of a Phase 2 deal and removal of all tariffs levied over the past two years. \\nIn December, the Trump administration announced it would hold off on new tariffs on roughly $160 billion worth of imports, and halve the tariff rate Feb. 14 on roughly $120 billion worth of imports from China as part of the Phase 1 agreement. \\nBut until a Phase 2 deal is concluded, Americans will continue to shoulder the cost of tariffs on up to $370 billion worth of imports from China.\",\n",
       " 'This article s adapted from a lecture James Carafano gave at The Heritage Foundation’s Dec. 9 event, “The Problem of Nationalism.”\\nI have two recommendations to address nationalism. One is called parsing and the other is called spade work.\\nThis is not about arguing about bumper stickers, and the problem cannot be solved by discussing bumper stickers. When my Heritage Foundation colleague Jack Spencer says liberalism, he’s talking about Adam Smith. When Sen. Elizabeth Warren is talking about liberalism, she’s talking about the opposite from Adam Smith.\\nA really good illustrative example is “America First.”\\nAmerica First was a fine bumper sticker. Right after Donald Trump used it for the first time in a campaign speech, I went to the guys in the corner. I said, “Hey guys.” I said, “You know where this comes from, right? Lindbergh, isolationism?” \\nAnd the response was really interesting. They said, “Ninety-nine percent of the people that vote for us, they have no idea where it comes from. And the other thing is, it’s not what we mean.” \\nThat might be a fine argument for a campaign slogan, but it’s a completely inadequate basis for governance. So as much as America First helped get the Trump administration elected, it spent as much time explaining to American people and the world how what they mean by America First is not isolationism, that America may be fighting for self-interest, but it doesn’t mean America is selfish [because] we engage with friends and allies.\\nThe bumper sticker can’t solve the fundamental, underlying policy debate that has to be had and has to be taken more serious than that, because when people say nationalism, I think Kim Holmes covered the waterfront well. \\nFor some people, it’s just about how do we engage conservative voters, or how do we energize the popular space? Other people, when they use that term, they have a much darker, insidious, and evil meaning for that and you cannot solve that debate by replacing that bumper sticker with a different bumper sticker. \\nFor the serious policy community that’s interested in governance and keeping America free, safe, and prosperous, we simply have to do better than that. So I have really divided this into two categories, the parsing and the spade work.\\nI think the parsing falls into two areas. One is we have to have the courage and seriousness and honesty to differentiate between tolerance and the polity. \\nTolerance is about our understanding of the right of free speech and the willingness that a person say any kind of wacky thing they really want to as long as nobody gets hurt or died. Tolerate that all you want. That’s very different from saying that person has a legitimate part in the national conversation, that that is a legitimate part of the polity, that that person deserves a seat at the table. \\nIf somebody wants to be a white nationalist or a racist or a fascist or a communist, that’s their business. But that doesn’t mean that they’re a legitimate part of this national conversation. Those are tough things that I think we have to do to make those distinctions.\\nThe other kind of parsing I think is between sovereignty and popular sovereignty. We believe in a state system because it’s the best alternative to global anarchy. It’s not God-given. It’s not a natural right. It’s just a practical system of governance, which has worked over years, and actually serves America’s interests fairly well. \\nSo, we would broadly respect the sovereignty of other states, because they should broadly respect ours and we would only impinge on theirs when they impinged on our vital interests and we’re not surprised when they do likewise. \\nThat is very different from the concept of popular sovereignty, in which the United States should remain legitimately and importantly a global champion. The difference is between a nation where the people serve the state and a state that exists to serve the people. Those are two very different conversations and we have to be particular and careful to differentiate those two different discussions. Sovereignty and popular sovereignty, tolerance and the polity.\\nThis gets to the second category, which I call spade work. We have to do our homework, both in the parsing and in the policy.\\n In the parsing, I don’t think it’s legitimate to sit down at a table with communists and racists and white supremacists and have a discussion about what the future of America should be. \\nSome say, “Well, having them at the table shows that you’re respecting free speech.” No, it doesn’t. It means I’m giving legitimacy to their ideas. I think we have to have the courage to recognize there are people that rightfully should be excluded from the national conversation about serious governance in the United States. I think that’s fair.\\nNow having said that, I don’t think it’s fair if somebody is excluded because somebody says, “Well, he’s a fascist,” or, “He’s a racist,” or, “He’s a white nationalist,” or, “He’s a communist,” because that’s just a tactic of exclusion. \\nWe’ve seen the Russians do this all the time. I mean, nobody’s more fascist than [Russian President] Vladimir Putin, and Putin’s No. 1 instrument is to run around and call everybody in Europe a fascist so they’re excluded from the conversation.\\nYou can’t make those kind of difficult judgment calls between whether somebody that organized a riot to purposefully get people killed in Charlottesville should be part of your conversation from maybe a government in Western Europe that decides that they want to have a different judicial system or organize their elections differently. That’s something that’s not covered in a bumper sticker, and that requires all of us to do a bit of our homework.\\nThere also needs to be spade work in policy. The Heritage Foundation recently published “True North: The Principles of Conservatism.” They’re not policy prescriptions, but they’re statements that really go back to the purpose of what we tried to achieve in the Constitution, which is how do we create a fair and equitable society that respects natural rights and human liberties and create a system that fosters that? \\nThe bumper sticker debate is never going to get those issues, never get to those serious questions, and so I think it’s impingement upon us to take the conversation beyond the bumper stickers and actually get to the particular policies. \\nI don’t want to sit down and have a conversation with a white nationalist because I know already I don’t think they’re part of that conversation because they don’t believe in natural rights. They don’t believe in individual human freedoms.\\nOn the other hand, you like Obamacare? I don’t know why, but we should sit down and have a conversation together about what is the best way to do this, and I think we have to be prepared for that conversation and these kind of ideas really get us to that next level that’ll enable us to do that. And I’ll just cite one: “International agreements and international organizations should not infringe on American’s constitutional rights, nor should they diminish American sovereignty.”\\nWe shouldn’t do anything that undermines the sovereignty of the American people, or allows international, multinational organizations to impinge upon that. That’s not about being a nationalist. That’s being about preserving the freedoms of the American people.\\nFor example, China has a particular policy of taking Chinese nationals and placing them in various U.N. organizations because their view is that those Chinese nationalists are, above all, subservient and report to and act on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party. \\nTheir purpose in those organizations is not to assist in the governance or the operation of the organizations. It’s to drive the policies that China wants, to create the norms and outcomes that China demands. \\nWe should oppose that, not because we’re nationalists. That is antithetical to American interests. That is a direct assault on our popular sovereignty, to create international norms and international institutions which are designed at the behest of a foreign power essentially to undermine our freedoms and liberties.\\nIf we’re stuck in a debate about nationalism, then we have lost. If we’re not into the weeds of discussing actual policies and how they operationalize the protections of human freedom, then we have a great problem. \\nJust to cite one example, I think what Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has done with the commission he’s organized on unalienable human rights, defining what are actual human liberties, human rights, that fundamentally should not be abridged and that should be foundational to understanding of our policy of what we do and shouldn’t do in the world.\\nThat’s not just a reflection of our sovereignty. It’s a reflection of the nation of popular sovereignty and the foundational idea of exceptionalism, why America was created. That’s the kind of effort that’s worthwhile.\\nWe could have done a lot to get beyond America First. We’ve been slow in filling out the community of policymakers and representatives that deal in international organizations, that deal with the U.N., that deal with public diplomacy and some of these other areas because we’ve got to get to a level beyond a bumper sticker. \\nThere’s much more that can be done, and I challenge you. We have to be part of that conversation and, if we’re not in the business of parsing, if we’re not in the business of doing the spade work to get to the real depth of issues, then we have failed as advisers, thinkers, policymakers in the community. \\nBecause at the end of the day, it’s about we own this. And what are we doing to advance the ideas that the role of government is limited, that it’s there to facilitate our freedom and our prosperity and our security in equal measure?\\n>>>\\xa0Read the first article in this series, “The Problem of Nationalism,”\\xa0by Kim Holmes.\\n>>> Read the second article, “Founded on a Creed’: Understanding America’s Unique Beginning,” by Mike Gonzalez.\\n>>> Read the third article, “Nationalism Would Transfer Power From the People to Washington,” by Jack Spencer.\\n>>> Watch the full Heritage Foundation event, “The Problem of Nationalism,” here:',\n",
       " 'In his address to the nation Wednesday, President Donald Trump’s re-upped–clearly and in no uncertain terms–his commitment to challenging Iran’s continuing efforts to run amok in the Middle East.\\nWhile Trump’s critics in the U.S. like to claim his policies are mercurial, inept and irresponsible, the Iranian regime no doubt knew exactly what he was going to say. After all, they gave him all the information needed to shape his speech.\\nFirst, Iran gave Trump the inept face-saving fireworks display  Wednesday morning, showering more than a dozen missiles on bases in Iraq where U.S. military forces are stationed. The “retaliatory” attack was a transparent attempt by the Iranian regime to save face with the folks back home.\\nTechnically, Iranian leaders can tell their increasingly disaffected citizens that they’ve now done something to avenge the death of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, Iran’s chief architect of terrorism. But what they did was pretty much next to nothing.\\nTo reduce the possibility of U.S. blowback, the Iranians actually notified Iraq before the missile shower–a message they surely know would be conveyed to the Americans and other coalition forces in the target areas.\\nAs intended, the missiles did little damage. Then the regime quickly announced the payback was over. The message could not have been any clearer if the Iranians had said: Ladies and gentlemen, this is all a show.\\nTrump’s response was measured, responsible, and proportional – just as was the drone strike that killed Suleimani.\\nNo, Trump said, the U.S. isn’t going to fire back at Tehran like in some cinematic Wild West shootout. Instead, the U.S. will continue to take actions designed to get Iran to “be better”–actions that will further isolate and punish the regime for its destabilizing behavior. \\nTrump’s endgame also remains the same: limit the Iranian regime’s ability to wreak mayhem, while offering it the option of going back to the negotiating table to do a real deal–one that addresses the mullahs’ most troubling behaviors.\\nOdds are the Iranians knew this is exactly the speech they were going to get. Their face-saving strike that saved no face can be cold comfort at best. \\nThis article originally was published by Fox News.',\n",
       " 'At least nine American women and children were\\xa0slaughtered\\xa0in northern Mexico on Monday, the victims of cartel violence.\\nTragically, such\\xa0carnage\\xa0is all too common.\\nThe unchecked power of\\xa0criminal enterprises\\xa0in Mexico poses an unacceptable threat, not just to Mexico, but to the entire Western Hemisphere. The cartels’ reach extends from the tip of Latin America to Northern Canada. It’s past time for a common effort to break them.\\nFirst, let’s be clear: This isn’t just about drugs. The cartels will traffic in anything that makes a buck. Most recently, they have cashed in on the rush to smuggle illegal aliens across the U.S. border. \\nA report by RAND, for example, estimated that in 2017, the cartels made almost $3 billion from human smuggling. To repeat: The problem isn’t drugs—it’s the cartels.\\nThese criminal networks aren’t just limited to the Western Hemisphere. Cartel smuggling networks extend to Africa, Europe, and Asia as well.\\nThese gangs aren’t just smuggling operations; they are diversified enterprises. They engage in every manner of criminal activity from murder-for-hire to kidnapping, extortion, fraud, money laundering, car theft, and on and on. Their avarice, braveness, ambition, and unconstrained violence would awe Al Capone.\\nAnd, the danger they pose is not just to public safety. Where civic institutions and governance are weak, the criminal cartels intertwine with oligarchs. Together they seize control of political power and state-owned enterprises, creating a stranglehold that chokes off civil society, democracy, and the rule of law.\\nVenezuela is the poster child for this pernicious phenomenon. Nicolas Maduro has driven virtually the entire country into poverty—leading millions of refugees to flee the hellhole he and his cronies have created. Yet, despite international pressure, sanctions, and internal opposition, his illegitimate regime still clings to power. In part, Maduro is still there because his regime is fueled by\\xa0drug cash\\xa0from the criminal cartels.\\nMonday’s murder of innocent Americans—three women, two infants, and four other children—shocks because of the senselessness and the brutality. Yet the harsh truth is that cartel-related violence in Mexico kills tens of thousands every year. Many of these are just as innocent, their lives just as precious—people who deserved a far, far better fate.\\nWhile the cartels are the real enemy here, we have to acknowledge that the Mexican government’s way of countering the threat has been largely wrong-headed. \\nMexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, commonly called AMLO, has generally adopted the old leftist policy of seeking “social peace”—a policy dedicated to the proposition that, if the government doesn’t go after the cartels, the cartels won’t go after the government. \\nInstead, the theory goes, they will largely confine their violence to terrorizing and murdering each other, and spend the rest of their time contentedly laundering their money and lounging by the pool.\\nAMLO’s way is clearly not working. Mexico’s homicide rate has skyrocketed over the last two years. Before AMLO, the record for homicide was about 28,000 in 2011. Last year, under AMLO, it was 35,000.\\xa0This year will top that.\\nPresident Donald Trump has offered to partner with AMLO in fighting the cartels. AMLO should take him up on the offer. He won’t find a more resolute battle buddy. These two, very different leaders have proven they can work together.\\xa0They have pressed for approval of a new trade deal.\\xa0 They have worked together on border security and refugee policy.\\xa0They can do this.\\nTrump and AMLO can go down in history as the leaders who broke the back of the cartels once and for all.

It would be difficult to have a more realistic appreciation for what it was like to land on “Bloody” Omaha Beach during the Normandy invasion without a time machine. \\nMore recently, Chris Nolan’s “Dunkirk” (2017) hit that mark, as well. \\nThese movies have avoided the kind of groaning missteps that detract from otherwise excellent movies like “Patton” (1970), which paraded around “German” armor that were clearly just American tanks painted up with Wehrmacht symbols. \\n>>> US-China Trade Deal Is a Welcome First Step\\nWhile you can’t smell the retching horror of filth, decay, and cordite in the trenches, “1917” dwells on every visual cue from grinning corpses to the fat rats gorging on the detritus of war. \\nTo understand just how accurate the look of the movie is, compare “1917” to Peter Jackson’s incredible documentary “They Shall Not Grow Old” (2018), which relies exclusively on recovered archival footage from the World War I. \\nThe other point on which the film excels is portraying the human dimension of war. \\n>>> Trump’s Iran Endgame Remains the Same\\nAt the height of the European enlightenment when philosophers were talking about the perfection of human enterprises from economics to governance, Carl von Clausewitz, the great Prussian military theorist, said, “Not so fast.”\\nClausewitz was himself a veteran of several campaigns—on both the winning and losing sides. One of the essential insights of his monumental treatise, “On War,” was that conflict was anything but a mechanistic, linear, predictable act. \\nSoldiers, at their own peril, ignored the foibles, misjudgments, and shortfalls of men in battle and the importance of terrain, the unpredictability of weather, and the many other forces and factors that can determine the outcome of combat. He called it the “fog of war” and the “friction of battle.” \\n>>> Let’s Be Thankful America Isn’t Fighting ‘Endless Wars’\\nIn this film, Clausewitz would have lamented setbacks to the Prussian military, but he would have well appreciated the trials, tests, and uncertainties that confront the soldiers on the way to the front.\\xa0\\nMostly, the film reminds viewers that it is never a good idea to think of war in antiseptic or abstract terms. Whether it’s the decision to go over the top\\xa0or take out Qassim Suleimani, we must\\xa0never forget that war is a competition between living, breathing, cunning, determined foes and that the price of failure and, oftentimes, success is always measured in blood and tragedy.',\n",

(Photo: Iranian Supreme Leader Press Office/Handout/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\\n\\nMaryam Rostampour\\n\\nMaryam Rostampour is an Iranian Christian who survived eight months in Iran's Evin Prison.\\n\\nMarziyeh Amirizaeh\\n\\nMarziyeh Amirizaeh is an Iranian Christian who survived persecution and a death sentence from the Iranian government.\\nIn 2009, the Iranian government arrested and imprisoned us and sentenced us to death by hanging because of our evangelical Christian faith. We recounted that experience in the book “Captive in Iran.”\\nWe have experienced firsthand the cruelty of the Iranian regime, including the intelligence officers and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps forces who were responsible for brutally torturing our best friend, Shirin Alam Hooli, a Kurdish activist, and her execution by hanging, among many of their other cruel actions. \\nThe Revolutionary Guard is notorious in Iran as a force behind all suppressions, arrests, tortures, and mass killings of many Iranians, including in the most recent protests last November, in which well over a thousand (and likely more) were killed, and many more were arrested. Also, the force is responsible for terrorist actions across the Middle East in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, and beyond. \\xa0\\nFor many Iranians, including us, it was a relief to hear\\nthat Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard\\nCorps’ elite Quds Force, was killed last week in a U.S.-led strike. Suleimani has\\nblood on his hands of not only Iranians, but also U.S. service members, Iraqis,\\nAfghanis, and Syrians. \\nMost people in Iran are celebrating the death of a man who\\nmurdered innocent Iranians as recently as the November protests. Unlike what is\\nshown in the Western media, people inside Iran are sending out videos through\\nsocial media that show they are privately dancing at their homes, celebrating\\nthe death of Suleimani. Some even bake and give each other cookies to show\\ntheir happiness. \\nIn November, thousands of Iranians were brutally killed by\\nthe regime’s agents, particularly by the Revolutionary Guard forces under the\\nleadership of Suleimani.\\nMany families lost their loved ones, including young\\nchildren, during the suppression of the protests. Some could not even get the\\nbodies of their children released or were forced to pay the price of the bullet\\n(thousands of dollars) to get their bodies returned. \\nOther families, including that of Pouya Bakhtiari, were not even allowed to mourn or have a funeral for their children because the regime was afraid many Iranians would join and that would lead to another protest against the regime. \\nIf the people of Iran had the freedom to attend the funerals\\nof those who were killed during the recent protests, we would likely see\\nmillions of Iranians show up and support the anti-regime movement. \\nIt is important to understand that the crowd that gathered\\nfor Suleimani’s funeral does not represent the Iranian people at large.\\nSupporters of the regime and those who truly mourn the death of terrorist Suleimani\\nare in the minority. \\nMost of those shown on state television are either paid by\\nthe regime—such as Basijis—or forced to attend by regime security forces. On\\nMonday, four people were arrested because they expressed their happiness at\\nSuleimani’s death on social media, according to Iran\\nInternational. \\nSince the death of Suleimani, the regime has shut down schools, bazaars (shops and places of business), and public offices and forced people to attend the funeral. It bused school children to the funeral and even forced them to cry for the TV cameras. \\nThe regime also ordered all traffic to be directed to the location\\nof the funeral so that even those who didn’t want to participate had no choice\\nbut to join the crowd. It stopped all subways and trains and forced riders to leave\\nthe stations and join the crowd in the streets. \\nThe funeral was just a big show orchestrated by the Iranian\\nregime to make it appear that Suleimani was beloved by the Iranian people, and that\\nthey want revenge for his death—which is not what we’re hearing from firsthand\\nsources and Persian news sources. \\nWe know from our time in Iran that the regime uses threats\\nand force to make people attend ceremonies like this to show massive support\\nfor the government. In school, our principals forced us to say, “Death to\\nAmerica and death to Israel” every day before class and to attend speeches\\nwhenever the president or other government authorities came to our city—and we\\nwould be expelled if we didn’t attend. The same was true for high school and\\nuniversity students. \\nIn general, if people do not attend such gatherings, they\\nwill lose their jobs, public benefits, and even risk their lives and security. \\nMeanwhile, much of the Western media seems to be partnering\\nwith the Iranian government in spreading the propaganda that there is massive popular\\nsupport for the regime. Western media focused on the huge crowds mourning the\\ndeath of Suleimani and tried to show that people in Iran are angry about his\\ndeath and want revenge. \\nThe reality is that most Iranians love the United States and Americans, and would like to establish a friendly relationship with Israel and the U.S. and live in peace with other nations. \\nIran has been captured by this hostile regime and the mullahs\\n(religious leaders) for more than 40 years. Many Iranians who have been\\nsuppressed by the regime have shown, through their protests, that they oppose the\\nregime and want to see it replaced. \\nMost Iranians, including us, thank President Donald Trump\\nand his administration for standing with the Iranian people and adopting\\npolicies that are weakening the regime’s power within Iran and in the region.\\nWe also thank Trump for putting an end to Suleimani, a monster terrorist, and\\nother terrorist leaders who accompanied him. \",\n",

Luke, thanks for your time.\\nLuke Coffey: Thanks. It’s my pleasure.\\nDavis: So, on Tuesday night, Iran launched over a dozen rockets at a U.S. base in Iraq. This was in response to the U.S. having killed its top general, Qassim Suleimani. What do you think Iran’s objective was?\\nCoffey: Well, their objective was to show that they are striking back against the United States to save face in the eyes of their public, but to do so in a way that does not provoke the United States even more to retaliate back.\\nAnd actually, one important distinction to make is that these are Iraqi bases inside Iraq, where American soldiers are located. These aren’t U.S. bases. And this is important to point out, because this was a very big violation of Iraq sovereignty as well, that Iran would shoot these missiles inside Iraq’s territory, at Iraqi bases where, yes, of course U.S. soldiers were located. \\nAnd in one case, in northern Iraq, the one missile landed in Irbil at the airport, which is both the civilian airport and also has military personnel. \\nSo, it was highly provocative what Iran did.\\nDavis: So, you said that they were trying to save face with their public in Iran, while also not doing too much to provoke the U.S. again. Do you think they achieved that? Or did they do enough to appease the population in Iran who was upset over this?\\nCoffey: Well, for now, the answer, I would say, is yes. And because in around the way the government controls the narrative and controls the messages, it’s very easy for them to spin this into some great military success. \\nI mean, in reality, we know that they fired 15 missiles. One landed at the airport in Irbil, four landed somewhere in the desert, and then the remaining missiles landed on that base in western Iraq. And there were no U.S. or Iraqi or coalition casualties, and very minimal damage to facilities on these bases.\\nSo, it was enough, I think, where the regime in Iran could go to its people and say, “Look, we struck back,” and there’s already these wild rumors flying around on social media about so many U.S. service personnel wounded and being treated secretly in Israel. And, of course, Iran has to drag in Israel somehow. \\nAnd we all know this is nonsense in the way our system of government works here. There’s no way the U.S. government could cover up something like this, but it’s enough where the Iranians probably were able to save face and had an off-ramp. And I think President [Donald] Trump recognized that. And that was clear by the tone of his remarks today.\\nDavis: So, it seems like the president sort of called Iran’s bluff. I mean, they’d been talking a really big game for months, and now they sort of blinked.\\nCoffey: That’s true. Certainly, President Trump comes out on top of all of this in many ways. And even some of his strongest critics have acknowledged this point as well. \\nPresident Trump looks stronger. Iran looks weaker. President Trump over the past several months has shown a lot of restraint against Iranian aggression. There have been numerous occasions where the U.S. would have been justified to strike back. And President Trump chose not to, always trying to leave that door open for negotiations.\\nAnd in fact, I suspect that this proposal to take out Qassim Suleimani was not the first time he was given this option. Because [former U.N.  Ambassador John] Bolton tweeted over the weekend that this was a long time coming, which leads me to think that at least during his time in the White House, this was a proposal that was being floated around, and President Trump declined it. \\nSo, I think the president felt like he really had no other choice. He had to show the Iranians that the U.S. means business, and that’s what he did. And paradoxically, the demise of Qassim Suleimani might be looked upon as the de-escalatory strike, that’s the strike that deescalated the situation.\\nDavis: How so?\\nCoffey: Well, because until this point, the Iranians thought they could keep going and going and going, and the U.S. would just kind of tinker on the edges in terms of its response, and then that response was so great, that impact, it was so great. \\nI don’t think we can overstate how important someone like Qassim Suleimani is to that, to the whole Iranian security apparatus. And whenever he was taken out, I think it probably gave some room for pause in Iran, and they probably thought, “Whoa, OK, can we afford another severe blow like this if we push the Americans too far when we retaliate?”\\nDavis: Yeah. President Trump had talked about how during the Obama administration, U.S. credibility as a deterrent force had really eroded. So, do you think this re-established American credibility?\\nCoffey: Certainly so in the eyes of the Iranians. I would say, the deterrence has been re-established in the eyes of our partners in the region who, to be honest, I think some were questioning American resolve over the past few months because a lot of things were happening. \\nInternational oil tankers were being hit, a massive oil-production facility in Saudi Arabia had been taken offline by an Iranian attack, a U.S. drone was shot down by Iran in international airspace and, yes, it was just a drone without a pilot. But this drone cost almost $180 million, and there were no U.S. responses. \\nThen, finally, I think enough was enough, and we now see that Qassim Suleimani is dead, and I think that sends a very strong message to the region, to both friend and foe alike.\\nDavis: President Trump in his speech on Wednesday to the nation proposed new economic sanctions on Iran. Given that Iran is already under lots of sanctions, what more can the U.S. do in this area?\\nCoffey: Well, there’s one kebab shop that’s left. In all seriousness, this is a very good question. And there are further areas that can be sanctioned further, banking and in other industries. \\nThe point with sanctions is that you have to leave room for maneuver. So, we hear this term, “maximum-pressure campaign,” but there are ways that we can increase the sanctions more, and yes, we have to get more and more creative as we do this. \\nBut it’s not as if every aspect of every industry in Iran has been totally sanctioned to the point where the U.S. can’t apply more sanctions.\\nDavis: We’ve often heard from our colleague here, Jim Phillips, at the Heritage Foundation, that Iran thinks in a very long cycles, thinks in terms of centuries, not in short news cycles. Do you think that there’ll be ramifications in later years for the killing of Qassim Suleimani? That they’ll have a long memory about that?\\nCoffey: For sure, without a doubt. And I don’t think we’ve actually seen the true impact of his demise yet. I think it’ll probably take years for us to see the impact of it. \\nBut in terms of how the Iranians will look at it? Well, actually I think there’s a good argument to be made about last night’s strike not being the only way that Iran will retaliate because of Suleimani’s death. \\nYes, I understand those arguments that even I just made about them saving face and it being an off-ramp, but also there’s a small part of me that thinks, well, maybe that was a faint, maybe they want everyone to think that everything is calm, everything is now OK, and we perhaps over a period of months become more complacent, and then they do something that’s even crazier. \\nI think it’s unlikely, but I would not completely rule it out, because they do have very long memories, and we should not underestimate the impact that the demise of Qassim Suleimani will have.\\nHe was a very talented, almost special individual. He had a unique knack for unconventional warfare. \\nThis is a guy who had only four or five years of formal education. He left his home at age 14 to work in construction, and by his early twenties, he was commanding a division during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, and then he’s just spent the past 20 years setting the Middle East on fire. \\nAnd it all finally caught up with him. But nevertheless, he’s not going to be replaced very easily, because he was a unique individual, and it’s going to leave a huge gaping hole in Iran’s capabilities. And as we sort of seen in Iran with the mourning and the tens of thousands—perhaps hundreds of thousands—of people who’ve come onto the streets to say their goodbyes to Qassim Suleimani. \\nYes, of course, this is Iran, and it wouldn’t be the first time that the government has orchestrated something like this or forced people to go out and do this. But actually I think most of this is probably genuine.\\nThe Iranians view him as a national hero, and have viewed him as such for a number of reasons. Not because he was very effective at what he did, but also he was always seen as one of these guys who came from nothing who sort of rose to the top and didn’t get too corrupted along the way. \\nHe was never very flashy. He wasn’t the type of Iranian elite who would have a house in France or wear designer clothes. He was a very humble person. And because of that, he was popular among many Iranians, and so the outcry that you see is probably genuine—although some of it probably is choreographed, but I would say for the most part is real. \\nSo, this has left a huge hole. … This has made a huge impression on the Iranian people, and also the Iranian elite. And they’re, like I said, there is a small part of me that thinks that they’re not going to let this slide so easily, and we should remain vigilant, and we should remain with our guard up for the foreseeable future.\\nDavis: Well, also on Wednesday, President Trump shifted away from overt military action and said he wants to get a new deal, a new nuclear deal with Iran. \\nWhat are the prospects for that at this point, especially as we’ve seen deteriorating relations with Iran and that the old Iran deal is dead?\\nCoffey: Well, this is President Trump’s style. He prefers negotiation. He prefers making a deal. His instincts are not to go to war. He does not want to go to war with Iran. He’s not looking for a fight. \\nThe last thing he wants during an election year is Operation Persian Freedom. This would be hugely unpopular for him, and most Americans don’t want it either. So, he’s always kept this door open for a deal. \\nAnd even in his speech he gave us today from the White House, he suggested, even went so far as to suggest that there are areas that Iran and the U.S. can cooperate on, in terms of defeating ISIS, for example, which is a pretty bold statement to make—which, of course, ISIS is the enemy of both Iran and the United States. But that doesn’t necessarily make the United States and Iran partners. \\nBut it was a very bold statement to make, and I think it sends a signal that he is willing to keep that door open for diplomacy, and I think that’s very important.\\nDavis: So in terms of a nuclear deal, I mean where do you even start at this point on a new deal?\\nCoffey: Well, right now, we’re back at the basics of confidence-building. We’re nowhere close to the Iranians and the American sitting around the table and hammering out a new deal at this point. \\nI think that it’s going to take a … we’ll need a period of months of calmness and hopefully that’s what we’re entering right now. \\nIf Iran is smart, President Trump has shown today that he doesn’t want to escalate it anymore. If [the] Iranians are smart, they won’t escalate it any more, and we can see where we go in the next few months.\\nDavis: I’m just curious, your take, in Iran, do you think a nuclear deal now with the U.S. would be seen as submitting to the U.S.?\\nCoffey: Well, I don’t know if the regime really has to worry about that. They don’t have to worry about public opinion in the same way that democracies do, and they can control the narrative a lot better. \\nThat’s why they can lob 15 missiles into Iraq, 11 of which only hit the target, four completely miss altogether, and they claim as being some great military success. Only in Iran can you do that, or perhaps North Korea, or a few other very closed societies.\\nThe Iran deal itself wasn’t all—the original [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action] deal agreed under [President Barack] Obama—wasn’t all that popular in some parts of Iran anyway. \\nMany of the average Iranians who thought the lifting of sanctions was going to bring new economic opportunities, never saw the economic windfall. It mainly helped many of the elites at the very top. And then there was an internal debate inside the Iranian leadership about the merits of this deal. \\nI mean, this deal was never passed by their Majles, which is their version of the parliament. So, it wasn’t exactly widely supported in Iran at the time either. I mean, it was a very controversial deal, whether it was in Washington or Tehran. Really, the only place it enjoyed huge levels of popularity was Europe.\\nDavis: Do you think that the Iran deal contributed to the current situation we’re in with Iran?\\nCoffey: Well, certainly it emboldened them with lots of cash and money and diplomatic legitimacy, emboldened their willingness to well assert themselves more on the global stage, because they were treated as, well, they’re sort of taken out of the “pariah” camp and brought more into the mainstream. \\nPresident Trump’s claim today that the money they were given because of the Iran deal funded the missiles that were used to attack U.S. forces. It was a very tenuous, it’s difficult to prove that. \\nI mean … there is no doubt in my mind the money that they got from the Iran deal was used to fuel their proxy forces, and their export of terrorism across the Middle East. But I mean, in terms of assigning a certain amount of money to certain missiles, I think, is probably very difficult if not impossible to do.\\nBut I think it was, I don’t think President Trump meant that literally. I think it was more of an illustrative point that … when you unfreeze $150 billion in cash, and you give it to the Iranians, almost overnight, when you remove major international sanctions overnight, they’re going to enjoy certain benefits. \\nAnd the reality is, they weren’t using this money to build new schools and roads and hospitals in Iran. Their behavior across the Middle East after signing the Iran deal with President Obama did not change. \\nYes, they had more restrictions on their nuclear production. They weren’t perfect restrictions, that’s for sure. They were restricted, but not completely restricted. But in terms of their other malign acts, supporting proxy groups and fighting in Yemen and Syria and in Iraq and Lebanon, they continued to do so, and in fact increase this sort of activity. \\nSo, it has zero impact on their behavior in the region.\\nDavis: I want to ask you about Iraq, too. After the killing of Suleimani, the Iraqi parliament voted for U.S. forces to leave Iraq. How does all of this bode for the U.S.-Iraqi relationship?\\nCoffey: We should remember that this vote that was taken a few days ago in the Iraqi parliament was a nonbinding vote—so, symbolic. And about half of the parliamentarians didn’t even show up to vote. Only the parliamentarians linked to Shia parties, which are closely aligned with certain groups in Iran, showed up to vote. \\nThe Sunni- and Kurdish-dominated parties, they boycotted the vote. So, Iraq is divided on this issue. We should not pretend that every Iraqi wants the U.S. to leave. And we shouldn’t also pretend that every Iraqi wants the U.S. to stay. I think it’s a little more complicated than that.\\nBut, for sure, the U.S. is not going to be kicked out anytime soon from Iraq. And I think even those Iraqi statesman, the Iraqi parliamentarians, lawmakers, officials, regardless if they’re Sunni, Shia, or Kurdish, they know that despite some of their rhetoric about wanting the U.S. forces to leave, they know that they do not want [a repeat of] 2011, when U.S. forces were removed by President Obama and a few months later, ISIS is on the gates of Baghdad. No one wants to repeat of that. \\nSo, a lot of the stuff, I would say, is for domestic consumption. Politicians in Baghdad have constituents in the same way politicians in Washington or London or Paris do as well. Sometimes, things are said and done to cater to that constituency. And that’s probably what we’re seeing a lot of today in Iraq.\\nDavis: In his speech, President Trump also called on NATO to play a greater role in the Middle East. What’s been keeping NATO from taking on a greater role, and what would that look like?\\nCoffey: Well, I about fell out of my chair when I heard that. As someone who focuses, most of my career has been focused on NATO and transatlantic security, I couldn’t believe—I didn’t know where he was going with it, if I’m honest with you. And there are no further details. \\nNATO’s area of responsibility, if you look at the original 1949 treaty, is the North Atlantic region, north of the Tropic of Cancer. Right? So it’s mainly the European region. \\nYes, NATO forces are in Afghanistan after 9/11, but I think that was a result of, at that time, NATO not sure what its mission was. It didn’t really have this, the same mission that it had during the Cold War.\\nBut now with Russia back on the march in Europe, fighting in Ukraine, occupying parts of Ukraine, threatening the Baltic states, threatening NATO members—I think NATO as an institution should remain focused in Europe.\\nIt doesn’t need to be in the Middle East. But that being said, remember NATO is a collection of countries. So, while NATO as an institution probably shouldn’t take a bigger role in the Middle East, the countries that form NATO should probably play a bigger role in the Middle East.\\nDavis: I mean, do you think that was maybe just Trump signaling he wants the U.S. to distance itself, and other European countries to take more of a footprint?\\nCoffey: Exactly. If I was translating that from Trump language, I would say that it was, Americans have done enough in the Middle East.\\nDavis: No more stupid wars.\\nCoffey: It’s time for others to do more, and Europe should do more. He doesn’t, he didn’t, I don’t think he really meant NATO. I think he actually means Europe, but who knows?\\nDavis: Well, in a separate news story, a Ukrainian airliner crashed just outside of Tehran, minutes after it took off and only hours after Iran had launched its rocket attacks on Iraq. \\nThe crash killed all 176 people onboard. What do you make of this? Could this—I mean, some are speculating that this, the timing of it and the location, signals this could have been an accidental strike by Iranian rockets.\\nCoffey: It’s very tragic and sad, and I feel bad for all the passengers and their families and the crew that were on that plane. \\nThe question or the reality is, we don’t know right now what happened. But because of the circumstances, you cannot rule out that the plane wasn’t accidentally shot down, but we don’t know. And there are all these stories out there now, the Iranians are not going to share the black box … but there are pictures that are surfacing on social media. \\nSo, no doubt … these forensic experts that are online will be piecing together the clues, and we’ll have a bit more of a picture in the coming days, I suspect. But I think it was highly irresponsible of the Iranians to launch an attack like this, and at the same time allow planes to land and depart from their major civilian international airports.\\nPresumably, they knew that this rocket attack was 15 rockets. Who knows how much time it took to fire off these 15 rockets? But I’m going to guess, probably not very much. So why couldn’t they just temporarily close the airspace? \\nThey gave the Iraqis apparently a warning that this attack was coming. The U.S. actually last night issued, the FAA issued a warning, to U.S. aircraft in the [Persian Gulf] that because of heightened military activity, they were to avoid certain regions of the Middle East. \\nSo … I don’t know why the Iranians didn’t think to do the same thing. Was this plane accidentally shot down? Who knows? Was it a terrorist attack? Who knows? Or was it an accident? Who knows? And we may never know the truth because of where this, this accident, this tragedy happened. \\nBut it does just further complicate the situation, because it’s Iran, because it happened the same night that these attacks were taking place. And then you throw in the fact that it’s Ukraine, and with their war going on and the bad luck that country’s had, it’s just sad all around.\\nDavis: So, one of the recent controversies this week has been whether the U.S. would attack Iranian cultural sites. President Trump recently hinted at that, but then said he wouldn’t do it. \\nOur colleague here at Heritage, Jim Carafano, has pointed out that Iran maybe hides its facilities under cultural sites or mixes that category. Can you explain what that’s about?\\nCoffey: It has been known that Iran has had some of its nuclear facilities near historical sites, religious sites, and that’s always created a problem. They’ve sort of used these locations as protection, so to speak. \\nBut the U.S. military is very used to operating in environments with cultural sites and religious sites. And for example, I remember when I was serving in Afghanistan, we cannot return fire—like artillery fire, for example, when rockets were launched at us—if the location that were where we were firing was within a certain proximity of even a library or a school. \\nSo, the U.S. is very careful about this and cannot imagine a situation where the Department of Defense would willingly, for no apparent reason other than to strike it, target a cultural site, because these cultural sites in Iran, they’re not the Islamic Republic’s cultural sites.\\nIn many ways, these belong to the world. These date back thousands of years. Iran, the Persian people are one of the great civilizations of the world. And we should never allow the Islamic Republic to hijack that and to think that they have some sort of unique control or ownership of that. \\nSo, I don’t know what President Trump was saying at the time or what he meant, but he did quickly walk this back. So, I don’t think he really had in mind that he was going to attack UNESCO sites in Iran, but certainly Iran has a history of putting some of their research facilities and some of their production facilities near these important sites.\\nDavis: Interesting. Well, we’ll keep following all of this at The Daily Signal. Luke Coffey, really appreciate your time today.\\nCoffey: Thank you.',\n",

He is The New York Times best-selling author of \"Bullies.\" He is a graduate of UCLA and Harvard Law School, and lives with his wife and two children in Los Angeles.\\nPresident Donald Trump launched a global round of teeth gnashing when he ordered the killing of the greatest terrorist leader in the modern Middle East, Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani.  \\nSuleimani was unquestionably responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Americans in Iraq and thousands of others throughout the Middle East—mostly Muslim. His global terror network ran from South America to Europe to Africa to Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and Iraq.  Suleimani was an unparalleled organizer and a pitiless murderer. His death was richly earned.\\nBut for many in the media and on the domestic and international left, Trump’s action was precipitously “provocative.” \\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi called  Suleimani ‘s killing—which came directly after a  Suleimani-approved terror assault on America’s embassy in Baghdad and amidst reported further plans for escalated terror against American targets–“disproportionate.” \\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., suggested that Trump, not the Iranians, had “escalated” the situation. Former Vice President Joe Biden said that Trump had “just tossed a stick of dynamite into a tinderbox.”\\nThis reaction has been magnified by the media, many of whom have been speculating about the possibility of all-out war between the United States and Iran. Think pieces have been written about whether the United States will reactivate the draft (spoiler alert: No, we won’t). Musings have filled the newspapers about the supposed conflagration prompted not by Iranian evil but by Trumpian reactivity.\\nAll of this smacks less of legitimate concern about what comes next than it does of sheer panic that Trump has overturned a decade of American and European appeasement of the Iranian regime. \\nBen Rhodes, former President Barack Obama’s deputy national security adviser, architect of the Iran deal, and an overt liar who told the American public that Iran was on its way to moderation if only the United States would loosen economic restrictions on the terror state, has placed blame for volatility squarely before Trump. \\nSusan Rice, Obama’s national security adviser during the Iran deal and another overt liar who told the American public that Islamic terror against our Benghazi embassy was rooted in anger over a YouTube video, soberly informed Americans that “Americans would be wise to brace for war.” \\nBiden suggested that in throwing out the Iran deal, Trump had paved the way for war—and, oh, by the way, the Iran deal was “airtight.”\\nThis is a deliberate misreading of history designed to absolve the Obama administration of its Iran policy debacle. \\nThe administration pursued a policy of strengthening Iran economically—and did so while openly acknowledging that Iran would use that newly gained economic strength to pursue terrorism and ballistic missile testing. In speaking of the sanctions relief given to Iran, then-Secretary of State John Kerry explained in January 2016, “I think that some of it will end up in the hands of the IRGC or other entities, some of which are labeled terrorists.” \\nThat’s precisely what happened. In March 2016, then-U.S. Central Command nominee Army Gen. Joseph Votel said that Iran had become “more aggressive” since the advent of the nuclear deal. Indeed, Iran has built up Hezbollah in Lebanon, propped up Bashar Assad in Syria, increased its presence in Iraq and bolstered its war in Yemen. In the past few months, Iran and its proxies have attacked shipping in the Strait of Hormuz, Saudi oil facilities, an American drone and an American embassy, among other targets. All of this occurred while the Trump administration did little or nothing in response. \\nThen Trump ordered the killing of Suleimani. Suddenly, we have been informed by dishonest Democrats and their media allies, Iran has gone rogue. \\nNonsense. Iran has been rogue for decades. The Iran deal was simply an attempt to whistle past the graveyard with the terror regime—to pay it off long enough so that President Barack Obama could declare the problem handled. This was, after all, the Obama strategy in Crimea and Syria: Declare a red line; run away from it; pretend that pusillanimous inaction is bravery and deterrence provocation.\\nTrump thought differently. Now Iran has come face to face with the prospect that actions have consequences— and those consequences don’t involve pallets of cash being shipped over to fund terror organizations that span the globe.\\nCOPYRIGHT 2020 CREATORS.COM',\n",
       " 'Iran’s Islamist dictatorship has been challenged and rebuked in recent weeks by massive political protests—not only at home, but also in the spheres of influence that the regime carved out in Iraq and in Lebanon.\\nIn all three countries, the popular protests reportedly erupted spontaneously and initially focused on economic issues, particularly high prices, lack of jobs, and corruption.\\xa0\\nBut gradually, the protests evolved into full-blown anti-government movements, as unaccountable and corrupt regimes blocked any progress toward reforms that would address the protesters’ legitimate demands.\\nIn Iran, the biggest demonstrations since the 2009 Green Movement protests over Iran’s rigged presidential election were triggered by the regime’s decision to abruptly raise gasoline prices by roughly 50%.\\xa0 \\nHit hard by U.S. sanctions, Tehran was forced to reduce its heavy subsidies for domestic fuel prices.\\xa0Rather than having the sanctions lifted through diplomatic engagement and compromise, the regime chose to continue on its path of confrontation with the United States, intimidation of its neighbors, and lavish support for terrorist proxies.\\nLong-suffering Iranians, fed up with the economic mismanagement, corruption, and misplaced priorities of their repressive government, flooded the streets of Iran’s cities Nov. 15 to protest the price increases. \\nThe demonstrators also focused their ire on the regime’s expensive interventions in regional conflicts.\\xa0 In Isfahan, they chanted: “No to Gaza, no to Lebanon.\\xa0We sacrifice our lives for Iran.” \\nThe regime responded with systematic violence against unarmed protesters, who were attacked by internal security forces, particularly the paramilitary thugs of the Basij militia, who beat them up and fired live rounds into crowds at close range.\\nThe regime\\nsuppressed the internet to prevent Iranians from mobilizing through the use of\\nsocial media.\\xa0 \\nTehran blamed the\\nprotests on a foreign conspiracy hatched by Iranian opposition groups based\\nabroad and the usual suspects; namely, the United States, Israel, Britain, and\\nSaudi Arabia.\\nAs protests\\nsubsided, the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Gen. Hossein\\nSalami, proclaimed that Iran had defeated the foreign conspiracy behind the\\nunrest, which was part of the “world war” between Iran and “arrogant powers.”\\nSalami claimed that the Revolutionary Guards had\\nacted with “self-restraint” despite the fact that at least 143 Iranians were\\nkilled in the protests, according to Amnesty International. \\nIranian authorities claim that 70 gas stations, 731 banks, and 140 government sites were torched during the uprising.\\xa0It claimed more than 1,000 Iranians were arrested, although outside estimates put the number at close to 4,000.\\nIraq Protests Pose More Challenges\\xa0 \\xa0\\nThe Iranian\\nregime also has been a target of protesters in neighboring Iraq, who resent\\nIranian influence over the Shiite political parties that dominate Iraq’s weak\\ncoalition government.\\xa0 \\nYoung Iraqis have\\nstaged massive anti-government protests since early October, fed up with high\\nrates of unemployment, endemic corruption, and poor public services.\\nIraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul\\xa0Mahdi made a halfhearted effort to satisfy the protesters by calling for some reforms, but their demands hardened in response to escalating repression from the government.\\nIraq’s crackdown on protesters reportedly was orchestrated by Iran’s viceroy for Iraq, Gen. Qassem Soleimani. \\nSoleimani, commander of the elite Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which is responsible for coordinating with Iran-backed militias, also pushed Iraqi militia leaders last month to reject demands for Abdul Mahdi to step down. \\nThe result has been a bloodbath amid a deepening crisis in Iraq.\\xa0More than 430 protesters have been killed, and thousands have been wounded since Oct. 1.\\nPerhaps surprisingly,\\nmost of the protesters have been Iraqi Shiites, who belong to the same Islamic\\nsect as most Iranians. The Shiite heartland in southern Iraq, which provides most of Iraq’s oil\\nexports but receives few of its benefits, has seen some of the biggest and\\nbloodiest protests.\\nAs Iran-backed Iraqi militias stepped up their attacks on protesters, Iran increasingly has been denounced by Iraqi Shiites.\\xa0On Nov. 27, protesters attacked and set on fire the Iranian consulate in Najaf, the Shiite holy city that serves as the seat of Iraq’s Shiite religious establishment.\\n “We went for the consulate because now we are aware who is the reason behind all that we are going through,” a local activist told The Washington Post. “Iran controls all these Islamic parties and their armed militias in the streets that have made our life like hell. They are controlling the economy of the city and everything goes to them. Meanwhile, we can’t even get a job.”\\nSignificantly, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Husseini\\xa0al-Sistani, Iraq’s top Shiite religious leader, rejects Iran’s radical brand of Shiite ideology and has supported the protesters against Iraq’s corrupt political leaders. \\nAfter the grand ayatollah called for a change of leadership, Abdul Mahdi announced Nov. 29 that he would step down.\\nFinding a suitable successor will be a difficult task.\\xa0Under the Iraqi Constitution, President Barham Salih is required to ask the largest bloc in parliament to nominate a new prime minister. \\nBut that process is unlikely to satisfy Iraqi protesters, many of whom call for the ouster of all current political leaders and a complete overhaul of Iraq’s corrupt power-sharing system.\\xa0 \\nRevolting Against the Revolution\\nThe alienation of\\nIraqi Shiites isn’t Iran’s only problem. In Lebanon, where anti-government protests sparked by a new tax on messaging\\nservices have continued since Oct. 17, the influence and reputation of\\nHezbollah, Iran’s most powerful terrorist proxy, is increasingly threatened.\\nAs in Iraq,\\nLebanese protests have attracted strong support from Shiites dissatisfied with\\nthe performance of Shiite political parties that have been radicalized,\\nsupported, and guided by Iran.\\nAlthough\\nHezbollah once was regarded as the champion of Lebanon’s Shiite community and\\nprotector of Lebanon’s national interests against Israel, it increasingly is\\nperceived to be primarily serving Iran’s interests.\\xa0 \\nThousands of\\nHezbollah fighters were deployed to Syria under the command of Iran’s\\nRevolutionary Guards to shore up the regime of Bashar al-Assad, Iran’s junior\\nally.\\nU.S. sanctions on Iran and Hezbollah have severely undermined the ability of both to buy political support through economic means.\\xa0Moreover, Hezbollah has been feeding from the trough of Lebanese government corruption and has violently opposed efforts to reform Lebanon’s unsustainable political power-sharing system.\\xa0 \\nYoung Shiites now increasingly see Hezbollah as part of Lebanon’s problem, not the solution.\\xa0Hezbollah’s image has been tarnished further by its efforts to disrupt and intimidate Lebanon’s protest movement.\\nIraq and Lebanon\\nare on a trajectory to become failed states if Tehran continues on its current\\ncourse.\\nLike Iran’s\\nradical regime, Lebanese and Iraqi Islamists supported by Iran have been forced\\nto suppress the efforts of reformers, including Shiites whom they claim to\\nchampion.\\xa0 \\nIn the short run, the Islamists are likely to retain power through the coercive force of their militias and Revolutionary Guards. But in the long run, Iran’s aging ayatollahs and their Arab proxies have little to offer young Muslims except repression, economic dysfunction, ideological struggle, and endless conflict.\\nThe harder Iran’s dictatorship struggles to oppose reforms that threaten its power, the sooner young Iranians and Arabs forced to live under Tehran’s thumb will reach the conclusion that Iran’s Islamist model is bankrupt economically, politically, and morally.\\n***\\nFor more\\ninformation on this topic:\\nWhy Protests Rocking Lebanon Forced Out the Prime\\nMinister\\nProtesters in Iraq Have Legitimate Grievances\\nU.S. Must Lead Strong Multinational Response to Iran’s\\nExtortion Strategy\\nWhere the U.S.-Iran Confrontation Is\\nHeading\\nIranian Protests Underscore Regime’s Vulnerability',\n",

(Photo: Pool/Iranian Supreme Leader Press Office/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\\nU.S. forces killed one of Iran’s most powerful men, Qassim Suleimani, early Friday morning in Baghdad. He was leader of the elite Quds Force, the division of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps that conducts spying and terrorist operations outside Iran, and the order came directly from President Donald Trump.

We’re back early from our Christmas hiatus because of some major developments in the Middle East. \\nU.S. forces have killed General Qassim Suleimani in Baghdad. He was the leader of Iran’s elite Quds Force. Joining me to unpack it all is Jim Carafano, The Heritage Foundation’s vice president for foreign and defense policy studies. Jim, thanks for your time.\\nJim Carafano:\\xa0Hey, great to be with you.\\nDavis: So we know now that President [Donald] Trump actually ordered this attack on Iran’s top general. Why did he take out the general in Baghdad?\\nCarafano:\\xa0Yeah, so, well, first of all, Suleimani is probably the world’s most dangerous terrorist. He runs the Quds Force, this is part of the Iranian [Revolutionary Guard], which is basically responsible for all the covert operations, terrorist acts, managing the surrogates overseas, personally responsible for thousands of deaths, including hundreds of Americans who died because of [improvised explosive device] attacks. \\nAnd the Iraqi, the Iranians have actually [been] attacking U.S. people in Iraq now for over a year, the official number is there’s been 19 attacks. The real number is there’s much, much more than that. \\nSo, all this stuff in the embassy, which preceded this, that was just the latest attack. But the better question is, why now? Right? Suleimani has been around forever, right? He’s been designated by the U.S. as a head of a foreign terrorist organization forever. \\nSo here’s what happened, when [President Barack] Obama pulled out of Iraq back in 2011 and ISIS metastasized … we went back in, the Iraqis let us back in. We were doing operations in Iraq and Syria principally focused on killing ISIS. \\nNow, what the Iranians were doing during all that time is they were infiltrating their people and their influence out, getting more control of what’s called the Shia militias, so you have Kurds, Sunnis, and Shias in Iraq. The Shias are the majority population, that’s why they control the government. And the Iranians were infiltrating them, bribing, threatening, corrupting, getting control of them. We didn’t do much about it because to be honest, we were all fighting ISIS. So there was kind of a cease-fire, right? \\nAnd after ISIS is destroyed now, what the Iranians have done trying to push back on Trump and his isolation is they’ve tried a bunch of different things. They tried blocking the straits, they tried cutting off oil, they tried bombing Saudi Arabia, they tried shooting down an American drone, and now what they’ve done is weaponize the Iraqi militias that are controlled by Iran in Iraq to attack Americans.\\nSo that’s why now. And because he was actually in a foreign country in Iraq, plotting terrorist Iraqians to kill Americans. So there’s every bit as rational, logical reason to kill him as there was to kill Osama bin Laden. \\nThe stunning thing is, what the heck was he doing in Baghdad? He was arguably the most wanted terrorist of United States, the guy that’s in charge of killing Americans in Iraq. \\nWhat is he doing kind of out in the open in Baghdad? It’s like Yamamoto deciding to vacation in Waikiki or Osama bin Laden planning his next terrorist attack from a hotel in Times Square. That was such a brazen, in-your-face act. \\nIf the United States did not do that, that would have rippled throughout the region. What the U.S. did is not an escalation, it was a very justifiable, very proportionally, very rational act of self-defense. On the other hand, if we hadn’t done that, there would just be more killing of Americans today.\\nDavis: Yeah, he was caught at the airport in Baghdad just a couple of days after the U.S. Embassy had been burning in Baghdad. What’s the connection between him and what happened at the embassy?\\nCarafano:\\xa0Well, here’s the untold story, right? So the U.S. Embassy is in the middle of something called a green zone. It’s hundreds of acres, right? That is surrounded by Iraqi security. So unlike the attack at some of these other U.S. bases, you’ve got to get through all that Iraqi security to get to the embassy. Well, how did that happen? Because they literally walked through. And the answer is, somebody told them to walk through. \\nSo, one of the untold stories of all this is the Iranians really overreached in their attack on the embassy because by doing that, all the people that were responsible for that security that allowed that to happen or of criticism, they just gave us a blueprint of everybody in the Iraqi government security forces who are working with the Iranians.\\nDavis: So, they’re basically like double agents. They say they’re working for Iraq and complying with the U.S., protecting our personnel, and then letting the Iranians through. Who was it that was actually attacking the embassy though? I mean, were they Iranian?\\nCarafano:\\xa0Hezbollah, which is an Iraqi Shia militia that is funded and directed by the Iranians. And one of the guys killed in the strike with Qasem Suleimani, the head of the Quds Force, was one of the heads of the Hezbollah militia that attacked the U.S. Embassy.\\nDavis: Wow. So does this killing seriously weaken Iran’s position in the Middle East? Or is it sort of you take the head off the snake and another one’s going to take its place?\\nCarafano:\\xa0Yeah, I mean, I think it probably disrupted operations in the short term. And a lot of people said this is an escalation, which it’s just not. It is clearly an act of American self-defense. There’s no question about that. \\nBut, well, Iran will try and get back at us and my answer is, “Well, what are they going to do?” Look, there’s not going to be a conventional war. The Iranians can’t get to the United States. We’re certainly not stupid enough to invade Iran. \\nWell, what can they do? Well, they do have a lot of capabilities. They have surrogates, you have Hezbollah, the Shia militias in Iraq, you have Islamic Jihad, Hamas in Palestine. You’ve got the Houthi rebels in Yemen. They can unleash them on the U.S. or their allies. OK? They can try to do terrorist attacks in the United States or Europe.\\nThey can try to close the Straits of Hormuz. They can try to interdict shipping. They can even attack America’s friends and allies in the region like Saudi Arabia. \\nNow, that list I just gave you, over the last year they’ve tried to do all those things, right? So the answer is they’re probably going to try to do more of the same. \\nI think that the notion of war talk is pretty … I mean, in some sense we’re already at war. I mean, you storm an American Embassy, dude, that’s an act of war. But in another sense, we’re not going to escalate to a conventional conflict because our capabilities are very what we call asymmetrical. Right? We don’t really have the stuff to get at them, they don’t really have the stuff to get at us. \\nSo what I expect the Iranians to do is kind of more of the same. And what the United States has demonstrated so far is that kind of activity, if it kills an American, it’s going to provoke a response. And what it’s certainly not going to do is cause the Americans to back down.\\nDavis: Something we haven’t mentioned is that Suleimani is not just a general, there’s really a political dimension to his power. Right?\\nCarafano:\\xa0Absolutely.\\nDavis: He’s really the right hand man of the Ayatollah.\\nCarafano:\\xa0So the other thing, when people say, “Well, how do people in Iran and Iraq respond to this?” And the answer is, you’re going to see both. You will see people in Iran, and we’ve already seen that, mourning his loss, vowing vengeance, and everything. Who are those people? Those are the people that are owing to the regime, right? They are people that support the regime. \\nOn the other hand, there are vast swaths of Iranians who have been protesting and fighting back against their government for months, many of whom have been oppressed, tortured, and killed by his people. They’re kind of like going, “Yeah, baby.” Right? They’re happy he’s dead. Now maybe they’re not going to go out in the street and start cheering because they don’t want to get shot in the back of the head.\\nDavis: Is that a minority of people, though, in Iran? Or do you think that most people are probably secretly happy?\\nCarafano:\\xa0No, I think that everybody that hates the regime hates the Quds Force and hates Suleimani. My guess is that’s a very significant chunk of the population. And we’ve seen that by the scope and the persistence of the protests in Iran. \\nIn Iraq, it’s kind of the same thing. Remember there are Kurds, Sunnis, and Shia in Iraq, the largest group is the Shia. The smallest is actually the Sunnis. Saddam Hussein was a Sunni. And one of the problems was that you had a small Sunni group essentially dictating the country. \\nAnd then you have the Kurds, right? Which are often kind of their own little area. So the Kurds are just saying, “Dude, we’re just staying out of this.” Right? They’re just staying in Kurdistan being Kurds. \\nAnd by the way, they hate Suleimani because Suleimani helped kill a lot of the peshmerga and killed them, too. So, they’re not shedding any tears in Kurdistan.\\nThe Sunnis, they’re being oppressed by Iran and their allies. They have used these militias not just to go after Americans, but to kill all the Sunni opposition. \\nI mean, if you’re a politician and you don’t play ball with the United States, we might cut off your money, maybe not give you a visa and not talk to you. If you’re a politician and you shun the Iranians, they’re going to find somebody to put a bullet in the back of your head. So the Sunnis, they’re cheering that this guy’s dead. \\nNow, the Shias are kind of split. There are Shias that are beholden to the Iranian regime, obviously, they’re very angry. Many of those people are actually in government because the Shias are the dominant force in government. So when you have government officials saying, “We object to what the Americans are doing,” those are government officials who are essentially working for the Iranians.\\nAnd then you have Shia who are very nationalistic and who love their country and are very patriotic and they’re actually glad Suleimani’s dead, right? They don’t want to be a suburb of Tehran. \\nSo, people say, “Well, the people are protesting.” You got to ask the question, “Well, who’s protesting and what are they protesting about?” \\nIf you remember people tried to say that the people that were protesting at the U.S. Embassy were just like the people that were protesting over the last couple of months. Completely different. \\nThe people that had been protesting in Iraq were people protesting against Iran, hundreds of them were killed, thousands of them were wounded, all really at the direction of the Iranian regime. The people that attacked the embassy, those were terrorists and they were attacking a U.S. facility, they weren’t mourners or protesters.\\nDavis: You mentioned Iran’s proxies around the world, ways that they have to strike at the U.S. and our allies. The State Department is telling Americans now to get out of Iraq because they now have targets on them. Does that apply around the world, too? Should the U.S. personnel expect to be more of a target from proxies?\\nCarafano:\\xa0Part of the problem with it is what’s changed, in terms of Iran looking to go after American assets worldwide. What’s changed from Tuesday? And the answer is nothing, right? So, I mean, I think if there is an Iranian presence or influence, I mean, we already had to be concerned about that before. So, I don’t think anything’s has really—\\nDavis: But isn’t there a kind of honor element? You’ve talked about how in their culture, being attacked is kind of a humiliation for them and now they sort of have more of an incentive to lash out?\\nCarafano:\\xa0Right, but it’s also not a suicide pact, right? So, we’ve humiliated them before. I mean, they’ve done a number of different acts and we have basically responded and made them look weak. Their answer is just to try to do something else, which I assume they will do something here. \\nThey will try to respond in some way and look strong, but they’re not going to do it in a way that really escalates conflict because I think that’s more of a danger to them than it is to us actually. \\nThey’ve got a very weak political hold at home. The Ayatollah is very old. Their economy is in shatters. And the interesting thing is people always talked about the Iranian-Russian-Chinese Alliance. The Russians and Chinese have done nothing for them.\\nSo Iran is really on its own when it comes to combating the U.S. Matter of fact, the one thing that hasn’t got a lot of press, which I think makes me angrier than everything, is that one of the first countries to come out and condemn the U.S. defending itself against Iranian terrorists in Iraq was Russia. \\nAnd what’s ironic about that was just last week the president of Russia called the president of the United States to thank him because the [U.S.] helped thwart a terrorist attack aimed at Russia. So, if you help stop a terrorist attack aimed at Russia, you’re a hero—I mean, that’s good—but if you defend yourself against a terrorist attack, apparently, according to the Russian perspective, that’s bad.\\nDavis: Well, you said that conventional war is really not a possibility here, but could you imagine a situation where Iranian proxies do strike out more and the president orders some kind of strike in Iran? Maybe on oil facilities? Is that within the realm of possibility?\\nCarafano:\\xa0I think [it’s] least likely that the United States would directly attack facilities inside Iran without some kind of major provocation. I don’t know if it’s necessarily off the table. \\nLook, here’s what we know about this president—this is what the critics have just maybe been, I don’t know, sleeping the last couple of years—he’s been through a lot of crises. Iraq, Iran, back to Iraq, back to Iran, back to North Korea, terrorist attacks. He’s been very steady and when he has used force, it’s always been restrained and proportional, right?\\nIn Syria against a chemical weapons attack and, I mean, if I can remember, when the Iranians shot down a drone, we did nothing, that wasn’t an act of weakness. We did other [things] to punish the Iranians for that act, but we didn’t go in and start blowing up facilities in Iran, which, when you think about it, how does that even make sense? The guy that ordered the shoot-down of that drone is not some poor schlep who’s in the [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps] who’s sitting in a base in Iran. But when they cross the line and kill an American, the president goes after the people that did that.\\nIf you look at the attack on the Saudi territory, that was an attack on Saudi territory, not an attack on Americans. If you noticed, after we put Americans in that area, the Iranians didn’t do that again. \\nSo, why have the Iranians gotten so bold and still they’re not directly coming after us, because they’re not, they’re having the Iraqis do it, right? Why are they doing that though? They’re running out of options. That’s one. Maybe they just don’t believe the president when he says, “Don’t do this.” I don’t know.\\nDavis: Well, we’ll keep watching the developments closely. Jim, as always, thank you for your time.\\nCarafano:\\xa0Thanks for having me.\",\n",

Cully, thanks for your time today.\\nCully Stimson:\\xa0It’s always a pleasure.\\nDavis:\\xa0Last Friday, a Saudi airman shot up a U.S. Navy base in Pensacola and killed three people. What do we know so far about the suspect and a possible motive?\\nStimson: No. 1, he’s dead. No. 2, he was part of an international coalition of people who we routinely have in our military bases across all the services. He was attending with other Saudi pilots basic pilot training at Pensacola, which is the heart and soul of naval aviation in the United States Navy.\\nDavis:\\xa0Any early indications of a potential motive?\\nStimson: It’s a little too early to tell. The FBI has the con here, and having worked as a former federal prosecutor, I can tell you the FBI’s very thorough and they’re not going to get out in front of the facts.\\nBut from what has been publicly reported so far, we know that this young lieutenant went back and forth to home, as all international and domestic students do during breaks; that he had been a student for a while in this basic aviation course; that there had been a report of a complaint he had filed against one of his instructors because in the naval aviation community, they’re sort of bawdy and they come up with nicknames for people. \\nWhen you saw “Top Gun,” for example, you saw one of the pilots was named Goose and another guy was named Mustang. One of the instructors allegedly had given him a nickname, which he didn’t find acceptable, so he filed a complaint against the instructor.\\nMonths went by, during that time after he filed the complaint, but nothing had happened, he had gone back to Saudi Arabia, as I’m sure many of his colleagues had, and then he came back to the United States for training. Then he got a 9 mm pistol and shot up students in the basic training course classroom.\\nDavis:\\xa0Should this be considered an act of terrorism?\\nStimson: It should if the facts show that there was a connection to terrorism, and right now, the facts don’t show that. What the facts show is that a person who is a Saudi got a gun and killed people and he was killed as a result of it by the Escambia police department or somebody in law enforcement.\\n … The allegations are that he had written some things on social media which were anti-American. That doesn’t necessarily mean it’s connected to terrorism. \\nThere’s also an allegation that he had said something positive about Osama bin Laden. I can’t imagine anything positive anyone would want to say about that person who’s, fortunately, dead. Maybe he was motivated by some jihadi tendencies, but I think it’s really important that when we have an incident like this, No. 1, we express our condolences to the people who died. Their lives and their family’s lives will never be the same, obviously.\\nSecondly, it’s important not to jump to conclusions, that because he’s a foreign national and because he’s serving with our military and because he says stupid things on the internet that he’s a terrorist. We need to reserve that label for people who are terrorists, who are motivated by, directed by, inspired by other terrorists, and then who commit terrorist acts.\\nNow, if he is, and that’s what the facts show, then we can label this an act of terrorism. He’s a murderer and he’s a heinous, despicable individual who’s, fortunately, dead, but that’s all we know right now.\\nDavis: Yeah. You mentioned those victims, and the three victims actually charged the shooter, right? They weren’t running away. They were actually shot, and one of them ran out and gave critical details to the sheriff who ended up taking out the shooter. Definitely heroism on display.\\nStimson: Yeah. I will tell you, as a Navy captain who still serves in the reserves, of course I’m speaking as a Heritage scholar and not on behalf of the Department of the Navy, the CO of the base down there who gave a long and very eloquent press conference was so impressive. \\nHe said not only the right things, that we’re going to care for our families, it’s going to take a long time, but he really exemplified the type of leadership that we should all be proud of for men and women in our uniform. He rose to the occasion. \\nObviously, it was difficult for him, but in the days and weeks to come, the FBI will work closely with the military authorities to figure out why this happened. Then the harder part, which is, is there anything that we can do to prevent something like this in the future?\\nNow, for example, I know people have said, “We shouldn’t have military people from other countries training with our people.” That’s just ignorant, frankly. \\nWe’ve been training with our allies, military officers and enlisted, for decades. We need to do that, one, because it makes us stronger when we fight in coalitions; two, because mil-to-mil relationships really matter; and three, our main adversaries, the Russians and the Chinese, don’t do that. They don’t have the type of open, welcoming type of professional military relationships that we have established with dozens of countries, and we need to continue to do that.\\nDavis:\\xa0Does this suggest an intelligence failure in some way? Any warning signs that should have been picked up on?\\nStimson: We don’t know. It could have been. But remember, for those of you who don’t serve in the military, military officers today … they don’t live on the ship, they don’t live in a plane, they don’t live on base usually. \\nThey live out in town, like this young man did, along with all the other young patriotic men and women who were attending flight school. They lived in apartments just like anyone else. The government’s not monitoring what you’re doing in your apartment out in town, nor should they. They don’t have the legal right to do that. \\nWhether there were warning signs that we missed, it’s too early to tell, but I can be darn sure that and feel quite confident that the FBI will look into that. \\nI’m quite confident that the Heritage’s former chief of staff, Mark Esper, who’s the secretary of defense, based on what he said in the Sunday talk shows, will do a thorough top-to-bottom scrub to see whether we missed anything and whether any vetting protocols that we have in place are sufficient or need to be tweaked.\\nDavis:\\xa0Yeah. What should the FBI’s key focus in this case be?\\nStimson: Why it happened, and can it be prevented from happening again?\\nDavis: There’s been some talk about the gun law that allowed this shooter to actually get a gun legally. There’s only a handful of circumstances where a foreign national is legally allowed to purchase a firearm on U.S. soil. The governor down in Florida, Ron DeSantis, a Republican, is saying he wants to close that loophole with a new gun law. Your thoughts on that?\\nStimson: Ron DeSantis is an impressive governor. He has a very high approval rating. He happens also to have been a great Navy JAG reservist and a colleague of mine. I leave it to the governor as the head of a sovereign state to decide whether or not the state laws that would allow for this to happen happen. \\nIf it’s a federal issue, and I suspect it may be a federal issue, I’d have to study the proposals in place. I think we have a lot of gun laws on the books, and no amount of gun laws is going to prevent some jerk from acquiring a gun and doing horrible things to people that are innocent.\\nDavis:\\xa0Cully, I want to leave it by doing what you mentioned earlier, which is honoring those who passed. Adam Watson, who’s the brother of one of those who deceased, posted this. He said: \\nToday has been the worst day of my life. Joshua Kaleb Watson saved countless lives today with his own. After being shot multiple times, he made it outside and told the first response team where the shooter was. Those details were invaluable. We are beyond proud, but there is a hole in our hearts that can never be filled.\\nCully Stimson, thanks for coming in.\\nStimson: God bless that young man and his family, and let’s hope we get to the bottom of this. Thanks for having me.',\n",

(Photo: Getty Images)\\nBrad and Hilary Scott run a family jewelry business. They sell jewelry across state lines—and that’s become a huge liability. A recent Supreme Court says they, and other businesses, have to pay sales taxes to other states, which could potentially ruin small businesses like theirs. Daniel Davis recently spoke to them at the annual meeting of the American Legislative Exchange Council in Phoenix.\\nWe also cover the following stories:\\nThe Daily Signal podcast is available on\\xa0Ricochet,\\xa0iTunes,\\xa0Pippa,\\xa0Google Play, or\\xa0Stitcher.

You can also leave us a message at 202-608-6205 or write us at\\xa0[email\\xa0protected].\\xa0Enjoy the show!\\nDaniel Davis:\\xa0I’m joined now by Brad and Hilary Scott. They are the owners of Halstead, a wholesale jewelry company in Arizona. Thanks for your time today.\\nHilary Scott:\\xa0Thanks for having us.\\nBrad Scott:\\xa0Yes, thank you.\\nDavis:\\xa0You’ve had this small business in your family for two generations now, I understand. Forty-six years. And I understand that you’re now planning to retract some of your business activity because of a Supreme Court decision that came down last year: South Dakota v. Wayfair. \\nSome of our listeners might be familiar with it, but if you can\\njust tell us what this decision was about what it does?\\nHilary Scott: Right. This was a Supreme Court ruling instead of legislation, which is really important. In this case, they decided that states could extend multi-state sales tax collection to remote sellers in other states. \\nAs a company that operates across\\nthe country and around the world, anytime we have transactions to other states,\\nwe’re now subject to the sales tax laws of the jurisdiction where the buyer is\\npresent. That adds a tremendous amount of complexity in terms of complying now\\nwith 50 separate states’ revenue laws and sales tax laws in addition to what\\nwe’ve always done historically, which was complying in our own state where we\\nhave physical presence, and then of course with the federal government.\\nDavis:\\xa0To take an example, if someone in Florida buys one of your products online, you then have to do the math and calculate how much sales tax to cut out of the revenue and send to Florida?\\nHilary Scott:\\xa0Right. This is called the sourcing issue and it’s where the sales tax is assessed. In the wake of Wayfair, sales tax is sourced to the destination, and that means whatever the shipping destination is for the transaction shipment. And so in the United States, there are currently 12,000 different sales tax jurisdictions that we need to be able to handle as a business.\\nDavis: Well, that seems like an impossible task.\\nHilary Scott:\\xa0It does seem like an impossible task and we are really struggling to handle it.\\nDavis: How much has this cost your business so far?\\nBrad Scott:\\xa0Well, since we were one of the early adopters, meaning that we were live to collect sales tax in October of last year, we started very early on. To date, we have spent in excess of $162,000. The company costs in terms of hours is over 3,300 hours at this point in time. It’s an enormous drain on our resources.\\nAs a small business with 30 people, we don’t have 3,300 hours to devote to tax collection for far-flung departments or revenue across the country. What’s even more shocking really is that in that time, we’ve only collected about $68,000 in sales tax, so we are spending $2.39 cents for every single dollar of sales tax that we collect.\\nDavis:\\xa0Wow, that’s remarkable. Have there been layoffs so far because of this?\\nBrad Scott:\\xa0No layoffs yet. We’ve had four people leave in the last four months. And though we desperately need to replace them, we’re not. We are downsizing, but it’s through attrition as opposed to through layoffs. \\nIf it does come to layoffs, as a\\nsmall business owner, that’s not a decision that we take lightly. There are a\\nlot of steps we can take before that. Our employees, they’re an extension of\\nour family in a lot of ways and layoffs [are] probably the single hardest thing\\nyou can even consider as a small business owner.\\nDavis:\\xa0Well, I would imagine a lot of other small business owners are in the same shoes. When you talk to them, what are they saying? How are they dealing with the compliance costs?\\nHilary Scott: Well, yes, we are speaking with a lot of other small business owners around the country. There’s a wide range, honestly. Yes, a lot of businesses are struggling, but what’s most frightening, I think, is that a lot of businesses aren’t even really aware of Wayfair. That means that for the last year and a half, they’ve been accumulating back tax liabilities in many cases, or even if they have zero sales tax due, they’ve been out of compliance on registration and filings.\\nOne of the things that’s very tricky about this ruling is that it’s been discussed in the media as an online retail issue, but states through their policymaking have legislated that economic thresholds are based on gross receipts. That means any kind of business activity, regardless of the business channel, type of product, or type of industry. \\nSo a lot of manufacturers,\\nwholesalers, and distributors are also swept into this compliance mandate, even\\nthough they’re not online retailers at all. Again, there’s a major lack of\\nawareness among business owners that this applies to them.\\nDavis:\\xa0So if we get three, five years down the line and a state government decides to come after them for all those taxes, they could be potentially out of business?\\nBrad Scott:\\xa0Well, it’s even worse than that. Sales tax is a trust fund tax, which means that you’re holding those monies in trust for the government department that you’re collecting it for. And if they do come after a company and they assess that company for a fairly substantial amount of sales tax, if the company doesn’t have the resources, then the owner’s personal assets, their cars, their homes, their investment accounts, their retirement accounts, all become collateralized and are then accessible by the states to finish the completion of payment as they see fit.\\nDavis:\\xa0You and your company have clearly incurred a lot of damage because of this. Have you considered suing?\\nHilary Scott:\\xa0Suing isn’t really an option, because if we disagree with the state’s assessment, due to the Anti-Tax Injunction Act, our only option for recourse is to sue in the state where that department of revenue is located. \\nFor a company like ours and\\nArizona, if this is Florida for example, we would have to sue the Florida\\ndepartment of revenue in the Florida state court system. That’s because of\\nfederal law. That’s the only path to recourse. Realistically for an\\norganization our size, that’s no path to recourse at all. We don’t feel like a small\\nbusiness has a real due process option in this situation.\\nDavis:\\xa0I would imagine you’re looking to lawmakers to correct this, to make sure the Supreme Court decision isn’t the last word?\\nBrad Scott:\\xa0We are. You know, Wayfair was a long-fought battle between the states and even people at the federal level. And when we first started doing or having these conversations, we were under the impression that Wayfair was going to be something that the federal government would deal with right away. They have shown a reluctance to do so. \\nWe’ve been in D.C. pushing for\\nuniformity and simplicity in the rules and regulations that these states are\\nallowed to apply or impose, simply because for a business of our size to remain\\n50-state compliant, that duty falls on the shoulders of one or two individuals\\nat most.\\nFor most small businesses, we don’t have a [state and local taxes] department, and so if it’s not something that one person can manage, then there’s really no solution. \\nThere’s been a lot of noise about\\nthe software available to handle this and simplify it. But in our experience,\\nthe software is riddled with problems. We have had 36 different notifications\\nfrom states over the last 12 months from [streamlined sales tax] states that\\nour software provider was not doing its job, but the states don’t look at it as\\na problem with the software provider. They look at it as our problem. It’s\\nincumbent upon us to correct for that.\\nDavis:\\xa0This is a software that supposed to be calculating the taxes that you owe?\\nBrad Scott:\\xa0Right.\\nDavis:\\xa0And so it’s giving you bad calculations?\\nBrad Scott:\\xa0We haven’t had bad numbers returned to us. The real problem comes in their filing and remittance practices. They don’t necessarily file on time or they’ll file the incorrect numbers. I don’t know about the remittance practices, but we have received a number of notifications that we are out of compliance. \\nWhat’s really galling is that in\\nevery single one of those cases, we were in compliance. It was failures at the\\ncertified service provider level that led to those notifications.\\nDavis:\\xa0Wow, that’s remarkable. Well, you’ve also noted that the American Revolution was actually fought over this exact issue of being taxed by somebody out of your own jurisdiction.\\nHilary Scott:\\xa0It’s a little bit of a tricky distinction. One thing to insert in the conversation here is that now that states have established economic nexus laws for sales tax, a number of states are using those same economic nexus thresholds for income tax and gross receipts tax on companies. \\nWhere a sales tax is technically\\ncharged to the consumer, it is the responsibility of the business to collect\\nthat tax on the consumer in the home state. But there’s a distinction there\\nwith income and gross receipts taxes, because those are direct taxes on\\nentities outside the state’s borders on the business itself.\\nThat is indeed what the Revolutionary War was about. It was about taxation without representation. It was about England trying to tax the colonists all the way across the ocean, even though they weren’t there, they weren’t present. Yes, that is exactly what the Revolutionary War was about. The fact that economic nexus is now applied to income tax and gross receipts tax for businesses outside a state’s borders is very concerning.\\nDavis:\\xa0When you talk to lawmakers about this, are you encouraged by what they say and do you expect that they’ll act on this?\\nBrad Scott:\\xa0I think the greatest challenge when speaking with lawmakers is the fact that there are very few businesses that (a) have clean hands, and (b) are able to speak up. \\nAs Hilary mentioned earlier, the\\nawareness issue is a real problem because if you’re not aware and you’re out of\\ncompliance, then by putting your hand up, you’re effectively painting a bullseye\\non your back. And so, a lot of the businesses that we’ve spoken to over the\\nlast year who are out of compliance, while they’re in total agreement with what\\nwe’re asking for, are terrified of making any noise whatsoever.\\nThe sounds that they’re hearing on Capitol Hill are from the big companies that are already in compliance because they have 50-state physical presence already, and they’re saying everything is working fine, when the fact of the matter is, it’s the smaller businesses, the businesses that if you believe their rhetoric, are the backbone of the American economy that are going to be the ones that are hurt the most by this.\\nHilary Scott:\\xa0To add onto that, I would just say this is a very complex issue and I think you get a sense of that just in our discussion so far. We understand this in detail because we’re implementing this policy on a daily basis in a business. But when you talk about it at a high level, it sounds very feasible. It’s when you get down into the trenches of implementation where you see all of the problems really shake out. \\nCommunicating the complexity of\\nthis issue and the real problems of applying this policy and practice are our\\ngreatest challenges. We are definitely finding lawmakers at both the state and\\nthe federal levels who are willing to listen to this and take action. I do\\nthink we’re going to see a lot of trailer legislation in states in 2020 as they\\ntry and address some of the unintended consequences that were not anticipated\\nby economic nexus laws.\\nDavis:\\xa0Well, it’s a very, very sobering conversation, that companies like yourself are under such pressure. Thank you both for sharing, Brad and Hilary. I appreciate your time.',\n",

I’m joined now by Patricia Rucker. She’s a state senator from West Virginia and the co-founder and former president of We the People of West Virginia, Jefferson County. Patricia, thanks for your time today.\\nPatricia Rucker:\\xa0Absolutely. Thank you for inviting me.\\nDavis:\\xa0One of the very interesting things about you is that you were born in Venezuela and your family immigrated here, I believe in the early ’80s, is that right?\\nRucker:\\xa0That’s correct, 1981. We came here because of my father’s work. We came here legally. He had a work visa, but we always planned on returning to Venezuela. \\nVenezuela to me was the most perfect country you could have on this earth. Not only beautiful weather, beautiful people, very moral, very safe, very free, never had an income tax. The Constitution of Venezuela was modeled after the U.S. Constitution and close-knit family. I mean really, I just can’t talk … I can’t tell you how beautiful it was and we always intended to go back there. \\nNow I did meet my husband and that’s when I finally said, “Well, maybe I’m going to end up staying.” He’s an American and I did apply for permanent residency after I graduated from college and got married.\\nHaving said that, just so you know … First of all, it took me over eight years to become a citizen. That’s how long and complicated it took. I already had four children before I got my citizenship in 2004, but obviously a lot of folks know about what’s happened to Venezuela and I just want to briefly touch on the tragedy that it was. \\nHugo Chavez was able to win an election by making promises and sowing envy, telling folks you should have what others have, you should have whatever, the nice houses. You should get this, you should get that. \\nI mention it as a cautionary tale because so many Americans believe that we could never go down the road of Venezuela or other countries and I can tell you, I never would’ve thought that would’ve happened to Venezuela either. \\nAnyone who wants to see what the fruits of socialism is, all you have to do is just look at this modern day example. In 10 years, Chavez completely destroyed that freedom and that heritage Venezuelans had been enjoying since essentially 1823, I believe.\\nDavis:\\xa0Wow. You still remember living there before you moved here?\\nRucker:\\xa0Oh, yes, absolutely. Of course, we went back every other summer while we were growing up because, again, my dad was here for work. They paid for us to go back every other summer and be in Venezuela and almost all my relatives continue to live in Venezuela.\\nDavis: Wow. … The erosion of freedom and the socialism that came to … is that a big reason why your family didn’t go back?\\nRucker:\\xa0Yes, it is actually the main reason. My parents were always planning on retiring to Venezuela. They kept their home all of this time in Venezuela. Kept it up and everything else. \\nOne of the things that Chavez did within the first year and a half of his presidency was declared that if you weren’t physically living in your home, it meant you didn’t need it. Anyone who wanted to break into a home that was empty, the government would protect the right to stay there. Again, people don’t understand those type of real-life experiences with socialism and how it works. \\nAnother thing that Chavez did that of course hurt the ability for my parents to retire is he nationalized almost everybody’s savings or businesses. [He] made it really difficult for you to retire because you would lose your money. My parents, only in 2014 or ’15 did they finally give up on their dream of returning to Venezuela and applied for citizenship.\\nDavis: Wow. You mentioned breaking into homes. Did that happen to your parents’ house?\\nRucker:\\xa0Yes and to my grandparents’ house, because my grandparents died and the family wasn’t exactly sure what they were going to do with the apartment, but in the meantime, the apartment was broken into and stolen.\\nDavis: And there was no legal recourse? No way to sue anybody?\\nRucker:\\xa0Think about it. If the police are told you are to protect the squatter who breaks into your home, who are you going to go to? … \\nAgain, another thing that most people do not understand, we take it for granted here, that the police are going to be law abiding and follow the law. The culture in South America, I think in general, not just in Venezuela, is yes, obviously, the police … [are] supposed to enforce the law, but there’s a lot of corruption. It’s very often in a lot of countries you have to pay them to make sure that they do what you’re asking them to do. \\nIn Venezuela, it became so much worse under Chavez. He did not care to end that kind of corruption and it became where if you wanted to have any protection, you better have the money to pay for it.\\nDavis: Of course things have just gotten so much worse in the last few years.\\nRucker:\\xa0It is no man’s land at this point and because [Venezuelan dictator Nicolas] Maduro knows that he can’t trust Venezuelans to support him, he has hired Cuban nationals to be the military, to be the protection. \\nDo you think that these Cubans, who are the ones that have the guns, are going to care that much about Venezuelans who are not happy, don’t feel the election was secure, all of these concerns? No, they’re not really on the people’s side. \\nEssentially, I have to say we’ve been taken over by [a] foreign country. It’s not Venezuela anymore. It is Cuba who has taken over Venezuela and uses it for whatever their purposes and whatever they want and there is no way to peacefully end that when the Venezuela citizens do not have arms, do not have any way to fight back.\\nDavis: Do you have relatives that are still there?\\nRucker:\\xa0Yes, most of them.\\nDavis: Do you keep in touch with them?\\nRucker:\\xa0We do, the ones who have access to electronic forms of communication. Facebook, WhatsApp, that kind of thing, we use [them] to talk to them. \\nI will tell you, most of them are so terrified of their conversations being seen by the government that we usually cannot get real details on the truth of how bad things are. They tend to gloss over it and kind of hint at it. Only when somebody is able to escape do we really hear about the truth of how bad it is.\\nDavis: Wow. That’s remarkable. It’s almost like hearing from somebody behind the Iron Curtain back 40 years ago, but it’s happening right now.\\nRucker:\\xa0It is. It is just like that. I mean, [it’s] unbelievable … how scared they are of being spied upon.\\nDavis: Wow. Well, you’re someone who has really lived the American dream. You moved here when you were just a child and became a teacher, but after, what was it, 20 years, you decided to homeschool your children. Tell me about that process and why you made that shift.\\nRucker:\\xa0Sure. Just to let everybody know, I was a product of public school education and loved it and had a wonderful public school education here in the United States of America. \\nWhen I was 11, I said, “This is what I want to do, I want to teach.” I [had a] single-minded focus, “I want to teach social studies in public schools.” And when I graduated I did that for about a year and a half or so, but I became pregnant with my firstborn and the minute they laid her in my arms, I knew I couldn’t go back to the classroom. She was my priority. I ended up having five children and when … it was time for [my oldest] to go to kindergarten, she was diagnosed [with] autism spectrum disorder.\\nAround 2005 or so was around the time she was starting school. The public schools really did not have a handle on how to handle autism students and they wanted to put her in a special ed inclusive classroom with very severe special ed needs and she really didn’t need that kind of help. \\nI ended up deciding to homeschool her and I fell in love with it. I got a chance to teach, and not just social studies, but everything. That’s why [for] 15 years I basically homeschooled my children and had a wonderful experience doing so, even though that had never been in the original plan.\\nDavis: When you made that shift, did you take that on by yourself or were there resources at the time? I know … it’s becoming a lot more common just in the last 10, 15 years, but—\\nRucker:\\xa0It sure has. When I started there wasn’t quite as much support as there is now, but definitely the pioneers had already set the stage and there were some curriculums out there accessible for us to use and I definitely did find support. \\nWhere I live in West Virginia, unfortunately, the education is not as well as most people would like and there is a very strong homeschooling community in Jefferson County, West Virginia.\\nDavis: Wow. [You’re homeschooling five kids] and you decided to run for the state Senate. You were elected in 2016. What inspired you to run for office?\\nRucker:\\xa0Well, I will admit that a lot of it had to do with what happened to Venezuela. Chavez got elected in 2000. By 2008, Venezuela was already pretty much lost and I did not want to see my newly adopted country, remember I became a citizen 2004, … going down that same path. \\nSome of the things that were said by the presidential candidate running in 2008 really concerned me. I was one of those folks that got involved. \\nOf course, you know about the tea party movement and We The People of Jefferson County was the tea party that got created in my county. And yes, I was the founder of it, but it was out of a deep desire to really stand up for what made America great, which is our Constitution and our rights. It really concerns me that there are so many people willing to accept promises made and lose the freedom for those promises.\\nI’ve been doing the job always of trying to educate others and deciding to run for office was an extension of that. I had already started going door to doors, founder of the tea party movement. I had gotten involved in elections to get good candidates elected who would protect those rights. \\nIt came to a point that my own representative was someone who nobody wanted to run against. We were able to recruit folks, good folks, that we could support in all these different races but not in mine. Very reluctantly, I put my name in and the first time I ran I lost by 110 votes, but I ran again and this time for the Senate and I won by over 5,000.\\nDavis: Wow. How about that, 5,000 votes. You’re the chair now of the Education Committee in the state Senate. Obviously, as a teacher, I would assume you bring a lot of experience to that. How has your previous life as a teacher informed what you do now?\\nRucker:\\xa0… I will tell you that it’s almost held against me that I homeschooled. It completely discounts me as having any input because I homeschooled.\\nThey don’t count homeschooling as being an educator of any kind. I will tell you though, I did experience a really good public school education. I felt that was excellent. I really want to see that for every student. I want everyone to be able to say, just like I can say, “I had a wonderful public education experience.” \\nMy goal has been to take away the hurdles that are stopping teachers from being able to teach and bring more local control into West Virginia because it is a very centralized educational system.\\nI will say, I do support educational choice. For those parents who can’t get what they need, like I couldn’t for my oldest child, I want to make sure they have whatever they need, that that child be educated. \\nI will tell you that as a homeschooling parent, not every parent can homeschool. Both for financial reasons or other reasons. If their child is somehow not getting the education they need in the traditional public school, our priority as a state and as a people is to make certain that child gets what they need. That should be what is most important. \\nIf it means a private school, if it means a public charter school, if it means giving them enough funds to get outside support or tutorials, I’m in favor of as many options as possible because I believe parents are the ones who can best know what their child needs. I do not ever want to tell a parent who cannot afford something their child needs, “Too bad.”\\nI just can’t imagine that and it’s hard for me to believe that there are those who say, “No. Absolutely, the tax dollars should only be in public education.” \\nWell, you know how hard it is to be a public school teacher, where you have 25, 30 students and each of those students is unique and has different strengths and weaknesses? As a public school teacher you have to try to help everybody, which generally means you teach to the middle. That means there are kids on both sides of the spectrum that are not getting what they need. Giving more choices is not anti-public school. It is trying to make certain that we help everyone.\\nDavis: Wow. Well, last year there was a major teachers’ strike in West Virginia, which you must’ve been right in the middle of that controversy, being on the Education Committee. What was that like?\\nRucker:\\xa0I will confess that it was because of my education reform bill that the teachers went on strike. \\nI proposed a bill that was very comprehensive on education reform and needs. In addition to bringing more local control, it included a few changes to the funding mechanism, increasing the amount of money for nurses and counselors and psychologists for public schools. But it did include starting charter schools for the first time [in] West Virginia and legalizing it. It originally included ESAs [education savings accounts] for victims of bullying and students with special needs, in addition to other technical things that were [specific] to West Virginia. \\nWell, the charter school and the ESA portion caused the teachers to go on strike. I really was driven by the unions, who were telling the teachers, “We cannot accept this under any circumstances.” Even though it was just a very small, tiny, tiny amount of funding, they went on strike and they managed to table the bill indefinitely in the House because of their strike.\\nDavis: It wasn’t the National Education Association lobby that was pushing this?\\nRucker:\\xa0Oh yes, they came to West Virginia. We had Randi Weingarten there helping support the strike and the protesting, which is funny when the national organizations, teachers unions were the originators of the charter school idea. I just find that very humorous. \\nI will tell you that when they killed the bill, I mean that’s their prerogative, right? They killed the bill. Well, then they came and still wanted the teacher pay raise that the governor had promised them. \\nIn the Senate we were very clear when we said, “Well, we want education reform. If we’re not going to get education reform, we’re not going to pass that teacher pay raise.” That hard stance that we made caused the governor to call for a special session on education reform. After a very long extended special session, we did finally get some education reform passed in the state of West Virginia.\\nDavis: What kind of reforms?\\nRucker:\\xa0We got three charter schools and open enrollment. I don’t know if you know what that is. That allows students from a county to go to another public school, even outside of the county. And you only need permission of the school that’s accepting you, not permission of the school that you’re leaving. We also got some of the other things we wanted to do, like local control.\\nDavis: What are some of the things that you’re looking to push in the next year or so?\\nRucker:\\xa0Well, … it’s an election year. It’s always harder to do anything controversial in an election year, but we still have a lot of things that we still want to get to teachers. \\nEven though we were able to fund more counselors and psychologists and nurses for the schools, we still don’t have enough funding for one nurse in every single school. We’d love to see if we could reach that goal. I think that’s important. \\nThen there’s other things that we could do that won’t necessarily cost money, but just more accountability, clarifying what it is that we expect our graduates to have. \\nThere’s been a lot of discussion here at ALEC about civics education and I’ll be honest, I haven’t looked, and considering I’m a history major and was a history teacher, you would’ve thought I would have looked into that, but I haven’t looked to see what it is that we require. There’s lots of ways we can still continue to work on this.\\nDavis: Fantastic. We’ll have to leave it there, unfortunately, but Patricia, thank you so much for your time today.\\nRucker:\\xa0No problem. Thank you for having me.',\n",

He is a New York Times columnist and author of the forthcoming book “The Decadent Society: How We Became the Victims of Our Own Success.” Ross, it’s great to have you in the studio.\\nRoss Douthat:\\xa0It’s great to be here. Thanks for having me.\\nDavis:\\xa0So Ross, we’ve been told that in America in the 21st century, we live in a post-Christian society [and] that things are only going to get more secular. And yet, in so many ways, Christianity almost has a zombie-like existence in our culture, even in the secular parts of the culture, where not just institutional Christianity but Christian concepts continue to inhabit our minds. How would you describe the state of Christianity in America, the role it’s playing, and the relative grip that it still has on us?\\nDouthat:\\xa0I think one way to look at it is that on the one hand, there is a resilient core in American life of actual Christian practice and belief, right? Of people going to church on Sundays and identifying as Roman Catholics or Reformed Presbyterians and so on. And that core is somewhat smaller than it used to be, but it’s collapsed, [that] might be somewhat overstated. It’s still there. It’s still real. It still matters. \\nThen you have sort of two other zones of spiritual attitudes, both of which are more post-Christian, but are, as you say, still heavily influenced by Christian ideas.\\nAnd one is this sort of the kind of spiritual zone, which is a zone where people no longer believe in the absolute authority of Scripture or the authority of the Catholic Church’s Magisterium, but they’re still likely to believe in supernatural and metaphysical concepts that are—not always, but often—connected to Christianity. \\nThis is sort of the zone that runs from Joel Osteen on the right to Oprah Winfrey on the left, if you wanted to. And it folds in a lot of people who identify as Christian, but maybe are in some prosperity gospel zone that is a little bit unorthodox, shall we say, and people who don’t per se identify as Christians but would identify with Christian traditions and ideas to some extent—that’s more the Oprah zone.\\nThen you have a zone that thinks of itself as secular, this is the world of the intelligentsia, the Academy, perhaps some readers of my own newspaper. \\nThat zone doesn’t usually have Christian metaphysical concepts in the sense or it doesn’t have supernatural concepts. It’s unlikely to believe in angels, miracles, divine revelation, and so on. But it does still have a Christian moral framework in a lot of cases, a vision of the inviability of the individual, apart from the abortion debate, “Thou shalt not kill.” Right?\\nAnd a lot of progressive attitudes around human rights, especially, I think, still manifest a strong Christian influence and you can even see it sort of in what we think of as woke culture. The rituals of confessing your privilege and being ashamed of your associations with past sins, all of that, without being Christian, still participates in the Christian tradition in certain interesting ways. \\nSo, I don’t think it’s correct to call us [a post-Christian society]. We’re a no longer deeply Christian country that is not yet post-Christian and is still heavily influenced by Christianity, [that’s] how I’d put it.\\nDavis:\\xa0Yeah. That picture you paint is very residual and it points to a past where some of these institutions and ideas were much more shored up. Can you give us the broad strokes of say the last 60 to 70 years, how we got to where we are now from say the post-World War II consensus?\\nDouthat:\\xa0Right. … The first thing to be said is that a lot of these quasi-Christian or semi-Christian trends are not … entirely new. Right? I mean, America has always been a nation of heretics, to use a phrase I used in one of my books, it’s always been a place with a lot of spiritual freelancers. \\nThe American intelligentsia has been pretty secular for a long time. There have always been figures like Oprah Winfrey, let’s put it that way. Right? That said, there has been a shift where 60 or 70 years ago, there was a lot of clear institutional vitality and convergence between different institutional forms of Christian faith.\\nAnd you know, I use the example—because it’s relevant right now, because he’s about to be beatified—of Fulton Sheen, who was a Catholic bishop who had a Oprah-esque or Dr. Phil-esque prime-time show or maybe Jordan Peterson-esque, to pick a different figure, where he delivered a kind of moral and philosophical self-help to Americans of all faiths that was clearly rooted in a very strong institutional Catholicism and a strong Catholic framework. And of course, he wore the full bishop’s regalia while he did it.\\nAnd a figure like Sheen or a figure like Billy Graham or a figure like Reinhold Niebuhr, even a figure like Martin Luther King, all represent strong forms of religious influence that come out of strong institutional traditions—mainline Protestantism for Niebuhr, the black church for King, and evangelicalism for Graham. \\nAnd some of that is what we’ve lost, I think, over the 50 or 60 years since. That … there are very few figures who are directly associated with a mainline church or an important evangelical body, or even Roman Catholicism, who have nonsectarian and apolitical influence.\\nYou have figures who have influence as conservative Christians, right? Like Franklin Graham has influence, but he’s seen as a sectarian and partisan figure in a way that his father was not. And similarly, Catholic bishops are  always caught up in the Catholic churches post-’60s Civil War, where you’ll have Catholic bishops who are seen as liberal Catholics, and Catholic bishops who are seen as conservative Catholics, but very few who successfully speak to their own church as a whole, let alone the culture as a whole.\\nSo I think it’s that decline of strong institutions and strong nonpartisan figures associated with them that’s the big shift since the ’50s.\\nDavis:\\xa0And of course we couldn’t have this conversation without noting the sexual revolution that came after the ’50s. What effect do you see the sexual revolution is having on the church itself?\\nDouthat: I mean, I think the best way to understand it is to say that before the sexual revolution, if you weren’t a zealous, pious Christian, the basic Christian ideas about sex and marriage and sexual morality still seem to make a kind of basic sense, right? \\nSo the idea that maybe you didn’t think sex before marriage was a mortal sin, but you accepted the social conventions that if you did have sex before marriage, it should be premarital sex in the literal sense, where you’re having sex with someone you’re likely to get married to. Or, you know, that divorce might be necessary, but it should be an extreme last situation. Or, you know, living together outside of marriage is socially unacceptable, even if it’s not going to send you to hell.\\nAnd that’s what shifts in the course of the sexual revolution, that … conventional, middle-class morality stops thinking of Christianity, a Christian morality, New Testament sexual ethics as generally good wisdom, and starts thinking of it either as an ideal that people can’t live up to or as a patriarchal, misogynist, homophobic burden that we’re better off without. \\nAnd I think it’s affected the Christian churches by basically dividing them internally between factions that think … the churches need to adapt to this new reality by dramatically shifting or evolving Christian sexual ethics, and factions that think, “No, you need to maintain tradition, maintain the traditional teaching, stay true to the words of Jesus and St. Paul, and eventually the culture can be reconverted or come back.”\\n … It’s not the only point of division within Christian churches, but it’s clearly one of the biggest ones. And it just … didn’t exist, anything like the same extent in the late 19th century, early 20th century. Not that these debates weren’t there, they were, but they just became much, much sharper. And neither the conservative approach nor the liberal approach has necessarily worked in the sense of building a recovered Christianity for a post-sexual revolution age.\\nDavis:\\xa0Would you say that one of those approaches has worked in the sense of maintaining just internal integrity? I mean, you do, so if you—\\nDouthat:\\xa0I mean, look, I’m a conservative, right? I identify, I guess, as a conservative Catholic. So I think the conservative approach has generally more moral and theological integrity—not, I think, on every issue and every argument, but generally so. And I think that sociologically, it’s been somewhat more successful at giving people a reason to remain in the pews and present a persuasive, coherent Christianity. \\nI think that the amount of creative editing of both church tradition and Scripture that you have to do to get to a fully liberalized Christianity—as Nadia Bolz-Weber, right, to pick a current liberal Protestant writer, who basically says the church needs to adapt completely to the sexual revolution—I think to get there, the editing required makes the larger Christian gospel and witness seem much more implausible. \\nBut it does have to be said that the conservative approach has not reclaimed the culture. It can build a bunker mentality where people are  hunkered down and saying, “We’re going to … defend my family against the culture.” But that doesn’t mean you have any idea of how to do missionary work. And a bunker mentality can breed a toxic and hermetic environment.\\n … I want to be cautious of the demographic triumphalism that conservative Christians sometimes get into where they say, “Well, our churches are still here, and the liberal churches have vanished.” Because that’s not always the case, right? I mean, Roman Catholicism has declined pretty steeply, even though Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI were trying to hold the line on these issues. So, there isn’t a perfect correlation between conservatism and robustness on every front.\\nDavis:\\xa0Right? I mean, even in my own evangelical tradition, the term evangelical, because it’s been so politicized, it’s become more of a political identifier. People respond to surveys and say, “Oh yeah, I’m an evangelical,” just because they live in a white or rural or conservative region of the country. But that doesn’t necessarily map onto their worldview.\\nDouthat:\\xa0Right? I mean, there’s a zone of residual cultural Christianity on the American right that is not practically practicing the faith. And this is sort of the conservative equivalent of Christmas-and-Easter liberal Christians, right? It’s people who—when Donald Trump or before him, people on Fox News talked about like how there’s a war on Christmas, right? There’s a certain kind of American who doesn’t go to church but wants to say “Merry Christmas,” right? I mean, I don’t want to be reductive, but that’s a real phenomenon.\\n … As a Christian, you want to say in certain ways that any residual form of Christianity is worth nurturing. And the impulse to say “Merry Christmas” is a Christian impulse and it’s worth nurturing. But if you’re reducing your Christian identity to identity and not practicing the faith, then you’re not going to pass it down and the church itself is not going to survive over the long haul.\\nDavis:\\xa0And you mentioned some key names from the ’50s, Reinhold Niebuhr, Fulton Sheen. And then you mentioned Martin Luther King. You could speak of a religious center in America in that era, who is the religious center of America today?\\nDouthat:\\xa0I mean, I think it is figures who are  supernaturalist in the sense that they believe that prayer, divine intervention, miracles, all of these things are possible, but fundamentally, individualist in their religious outlook. \\nAnd so, it’s sort of you’re accepting that God is real and that life has purpose and the universe has meaning and prayer works, but you’re not submitting yourself to the authority of Ccripture or the Magisterium of the Catholic Church or any kind of traditional religious authority.\\nI mentioned both Joel Osteen and Oprah Winfrey earlier in this conversation. I tend to think of the American religious center in the ’50s as being somewhere between Fulton Sheen and Billy Graham and the American religious center today being somewhere between Joel Osteen and Oprah Winfrey, which means, again, … Osteen describes himself as a Christian. It’s not a post-Christian religious center, but it’s much more individualist and much less institutionalist and therefore much less orthodox by any definition than it was a few generations back.\\nDavis:\\xa0So looking from our present toward the future, what are some possible trajectories you see happening? I mean, I think a lot of us were very surprised to see Kanye West come forward as a born-again Christian, and then go up and speak with Joel Osteen and that whole thing and are watching closely to see what happens next.\\nDouthat:\\xa0Right.\\nDavis:\\xa0… I, with enthusiasm and hope, look at this and think, “Oh, he is very influential. [He] could bring new people to hear the message of the gospel and of the faith and that could be a means.” So, I mean, history is so unpredictable like that. What are some of the future trajectories you see?\\nDouthat:\\xa0Right. So one possibility is that this is actually kind of self-stabilizing, right? And you mentioned that my next book is about decadence, and this is the decadence argument … [where] you have a situation where institutional religion has declined but it never gets weak enough to fall apart entirely. And it remains, what you said, a zombie, a sort of zombie Christianity, right? That you can stay in this kind of zombie state for a long time with a core of religious believers keeping the churches going, enough Christian influence in the culture that you don’t get massive new religious transformations … like mass conversion to Buddhism or Islam or something.\\nBut things stay much as they are—that we’re a rich society, that religious individualism works for a rich society, a society where people are pretty comfortable and don’t want priests or … biblical literalists telling them what to do. \\nSo I think that’s possible, right? That actually, that … we could have gone through this transformation that started in the ’60s and have reached a kind of stable decadent zombie point.\\nBut as you say, history is unpredictable, right? And the reality is that one, there’s a lot of, I think, religious impulses that are unfulfilled in the current landscape. I think religious individualism doesn’t fulfill impulses toward community and solidarity and it doesn’t necessarily work for people when things go really bad. \\nAnd secularism, this secular world picture with its residual Christian moralism, can’t really explain where that moralism comes from because it doesn’t believe that God created the universe or that human beings are beings independent of their bodies. \\nSo there are those points of tension that could be points of fracture and points of change.\\nAnd then, if you look at just Western religious history alone, you can’t predict individual figures. You can’t predict a Martin Luther, a John Calvin, you can’t predict a Francis of Assisi or Thomas Aquinas. You can’t predict Jesus of Nazareth. You can’t predict the Prophet Muhammad, right? \\nNobody in the year 550 AD would have said, “Well, obviously, the next religious thing is a monotheistic religion that claims to be the heir to Christianity and Judaism that comes surging out of the Arabian Desert.” No one would’ve predicted that.\\nSo, I mean, Kanye—you know, Bob Dylan had a Christian phase. I think with artists and celebrities, you want to be simultaneously supportive of their conversions without putting too much hope and weight into it. But it’s certainly an example of how the unexpected rules religious life. And the reason that religion is resilient in a secular age isn’t just that there’s  a general predisposition toward religious belief, but also because people just keep on having religious experiences and that has an effect on the culture whether we like it or not.\\nDavis: Yeah. Well, that sort of gets to the secularization thesis that I want to ask you about. You mentioned Islam and that’s a factor that is  disrupting the secularization thesis in Europe where secularism really did triumph for a long time and now you’ve got Islam coming in through immigration and filling a kind of spiritual vacuum. In America, we don’t have that so much, but America’s always been the exception to the rule of secularization. Given those contexts, do you think secularism really has a viable long-term future?\\nDouthat:\\xa0… I think hard secularism is a little bit overstated even in the European context, right? … The sort of secularism that is represented by a Richard Dawkins, right? A sort of real atheism is actually pretty rare. Even in Sweden or England or in sort of Northern European countries where church-going has fallen off a cliff. \\nI think what triumphed in Europe was much more really the kind of religious individualism that I was talking about earlier that was a little bit more secularized in the European context because Europe didn’t have this tradition of religious entrepreneurship and startup churches and so on.\\nBut as for, I think, religious individualism though, I think that it has the capacity to last as long as wealth and stability last in a sense. And I think if you look at, whether it’s Muslims in Europe or Mormons and Orthodox Jews and the Amish in the U.S. and so on, I think you often see religious communities that thrive within secularism and people have a lot of kids and they grow rapidly at the beginning. But then, there’s also a lot of attrition because it’s hard to practice a faith intensely in a context of general disbelief. And it’s harder in the context, again, of wealth and stability and pleasure-seeking, right?\\nThat sort of hedonism really is attractive to people. … Even like getting up on Sunday and going to church, having kids and raising them, nothing made me more sympathetic to the life of the secular European then having kids because I realized, “This is really hard.” Right? And you can see why, given the choice, people might not. And the same is true of intense religious practice, which, frankly, I’m not very good at myself. \\nSo I don’t think that religious people should look at the real weaknesses of secularism and assume, “Oh, it’s going to collapse and we’ll have a Muslim Europe and a church of Kanye America tomorrow.”\\nI think there is, up until the point when the whole system seems to be in crisis, there’s likely to be a certain resilience to a certain kind of secularism. Again, not militant atheism, but a softer kind.\\nDavis:\\xa0When you look at political divisions within the church, particularly along racial and ethnic lines, you see two parties in America that have lots of Christians in them. Well, I think [the] Democratic Party is very secular, but has a large base of Christians. Do you think that political split within the church has weakened the church’s ability to have an impact on society at large?\\nDouthat:\\xa0Oh yeah, absolutely. I mean, I think one of the big shifts from the ’50s to the present is just political polarization is more powerful and people put more of their identity into their political party and less into their religion, right? People used to—the Catholics wouldn’t want their daughters to marry Lutherans and vice versa, and now that’s a lot weaker. But it’s Republicans don’t want their daughters to marry liberals and Democrats don’t want their sons to marry conservatives. And that, yeah. \\nAny time when political identity becomes more important than religious identity, the church is going to be in a lot of trouble and it contributes to this sense that if you wanted to be a Billy Graham or a Reinhold Niebuhr or Fulton Sheen, you wouldn’t have a place to stand that was seen as not liberal first and conservative second, conservative first and liberal second.\\nThe racial polarization is, on the one hand, in certain ways, it’s a deeper scandal in the sense that it’s connected to America’s original sin and slavery and everything else, right? Which has created, I think, very historically understandable reasons that African American churchgoers don’t feel comfortable in a party dominated by Southern white evangelicals, even though they have a lot in common theologically.\\nThe only thing that might be said about that that’s more positive is that on the one hand, a political reconciliation between black and white Christians is obviously desirable. On the other hand, it might be good for America that there are reasons why there’s still a strong religious presence in one of our political parties that’s otherwise secularizing and actually American politics might become much more toxic if it was purely, you know, all the religious people are in one party and all the secular people or all the non, you know, all this spiritual mushy middle people are in the other.\\nSo, I mean, there are ways in which the secularization of the Democratic Party is constrained by racial division and the racial division is bad. But I don’t necessarily want a world where there aren’t any churchgoers in the Democratic Party anymore.\\nDavis: Well, I’m afraid we’ll have to leave it there. But you mentioned a book that you had written, it’s “Bad Religion.”\\nDouthat:\\xa0Yeah. If listeners are interested in more of these thoughts, they can read my 2012 book “Bad Religion: How We Became a Nation of Heretics,” which some of it needs to be updated probably, but a lot of it is still relevant.\\nDavis: I am waiting for the second edition right now. Ross, thanks for your time.\\nDouthat:\\xa0Absolutely. Thanks for having me.',\n",

He represents Georgia’s 10th Congressional District. He sits on the Oversight and Reform Committee and is a member of the House Freedom Caucus, and notably he is host of the “Freedom Caucus Podcast.” Thanks for your time, Congressman.\\nRep. Jody Hice:\\xa0Great to be here with you. Thanks for having me.\\nDavis:\\xa0So this week we got the long-awaited inspector general report about the origins of the FBI’s surveillance on the Trump campaign and how that came about. The report says there was no direct evidence of political bias on the FBI’s part, just a ton of incompetence, lots of errors and mistakes and omissions in their applications to the FISA [Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act] court to get their warrant. Based on your reading of the facts, what do you make of that conclusion?\\nHice: Yeah. I would disagree with that conclusion. You don’t have to go very far to see that this was much more than incompetence. There was an effort to go after the president and, fortunately, we have another investigation going on with Attorney General [William] Barr and [U.S. Attorney John] Durham. \\nAnd of course they immediately came out themselves challenging those conclusions and their investigation is much broader, much deeper. They have much more information to draw from. And it was as though they were responding with a, “Not so fast here, we have more information. We’ve got the goods. We know that there was indeed an attempt out of bias to destroy the president and to go after him.” And I think that’s going to come out when their investigation concludes. \\nBut I think … the report itself was fine. I do disagree with some of the conclusions, but this ought to send chills down the spine of every American. When you think that the FBI literally was weaponized to spy on American citizens, that is a chilling reality that took place. And we have got to get to the bottom of this, and I think at the end of the day, particularly when Barr’s investigation is over, we will get to the bottom of this.\\nDavis:\\xa0Yeah. One of the big questions that I had looking over this is, if the FBI thought that Russia was trying to bait the Trump campaign and they wanted to stop that, why not just talk to the Trump campaign and say, “Hey, they’re trying to bait you, you need to watch out.”? Instead, they launched a secret surveillance investigation.\\nHice:\\xa0Yeah, and the reason they were launching a secret investigation, in my opinion, is because it was the DNC [Democratic National Committee] and Hillary Clinton that [were] paying for this thing. I mean, … the false dossier … you start connecting the dots of this thing and you see that it is very broad. It’s very deep state, if you will, heavily involved in this whole process, and the president really was victim in this. \\nAnd it is revealed, exposed, I believe, even in what [Justice Department Inspector General Michael] Horowitz has come out with to this point that yes, there was the whole FISA warrant—at least 17 major significant errors and omissions involved in putting together a false document in order to get a FISA warrant. Thereby to begin spying on the president and his campaign. \\nThat is a frightful reality that took place in the United States. And behind it all, it is being funded by Democrats and high-ranking individuals within the Democratic Party. And so I think when this comes out further with the investigation that Barr is doing, we’re going to see some extremely disturbing realities and some facts when that report comes out.\\nDavis:\\xa0Yeah. William Barr, the attorney general, says he … wants to take steps to make sure this kind of thing doesn’t happen again. And that must be the big concern, right? Because there already was protocol in place.\\nHice:\\xa0That’s right.\\nDavis:\\xa0So what do you do?\\nHice:\\xa0Well, what you do is you make people pay who have broken the law and they’ve broken the trust of the American people, individuals who have been involved in this … \\nOne of the biggest questions I have back home in the 10th District of Georgia is, “When are heads going to roll over all this corruption?” \\nPeople want to know. People want justice. People want to believe that Lady Justice is still blindfolded, that it does not matter if you have a “D” in front of your name or not, that if you break the law, if you violate the trust of the American people in this deep kind of way that apparently has taken place here, that there are going to be consequences and you’re not going to be protected or find cover just because you have a “D” in front of your name in this instance. \\nAnd so yeah, I think William Barr is coming out with the statement already. He’s setting the pathway, he’s setting the standard that heads are going to roll and that’s how you prevent this type of thing from happening in the future.\\nDavis:\\xa0Well, this week, House Democrats have put forward two articles of impeachment against President Trump and they’re saying that they have to impeach him now because he clearly cheated in the first election and the second one is coming up. So, you’ve got to prevent that from happening. What’s your response?\\nHice:\\xa0Yeah. I mean, they were doing this before he ever even took office. … As a candidate, the day after he was inaugurated, they were talking about impeaching him. And it’s stunning to me that they were talking about impeachment before the phone call with the Ukrainian president ever even took place. In fact, [House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi announced that they were going to proceed with impeachment before the facts ever even came out on this thing. \\nThis has been a Democratic Party from Day One of this administration that has aggressively been looking for haystacks anywhere they can find it, in hopes that there’s a needle somewhere in the haystack. And they’ve just been going from one issue to another, to another, to another, trying to find anything that they can thereby come up and say, “Hey, look what we found. Now we can impeach the president and justify it.” \\nAnd with these two articles that they’ve come up with, they’re extremely vague. They still have not declared what the president did that was an abuse of power. What did he do that obstructed Congress? It’s all vague, lame attempts to create something out of nothing. \\nThe only thing the Democrats do not have in this entire impeachment inquiry is evidence, and that’s a pretty big deal. When you’re talking about impeaching the president, you need evidence of crimes, treason, bribery, high crimes and misdemeanors and there is zero evidence of any of that.\\nDavis:\\xa0What do you make of the process that’s played out and what Republicans have or haven’t been able to do?\\nHice:\\xa0Yeah. It’s been the most unfair thing I’ve ever seen in my life. Never would I have dreamed that this type of process would actually take place in the United States of America. We have not been given a voice. … As minority party, we have not been allowed to subpoena people. \\nThere have been times that [House Intelligence Committee Chairman] Adam Schiff literally stopped the witnesses from answering questions that were coming from Republicans because he was uncomfortable with where those questions may lead. \\nThe president has not been able to defend himself. We’ve not been able to call any witnesses that we wanted to talk with. By House rules, the minority is supposed to be given a minority hearing. To this day, we still have not been granted a hearing where we are able to subpoena people and have our own questioning of individuals. That has not taken place.\\nI mean, the whole thing has been an absolute sham. While we were meeting in the basement of the Capitol with the depositions that Adam Schiff was leading, we were not allowed to talk to the media, but they continually leaked specific phrases from the witnesses that they were allowed to bring forth. \\nAgain, we were not allowed to have any witnesses we wanted. They only brought witnesses that they thought would bring damaging reports and testimony against the president and then they leaked certain things to the press that they wanted to. If we leaked anything, we would be in trouble. \\nSo it’s absolutely indescribable how unjust, how partisan, how enormous of a hoax this whole thing has been. It has consisted of anything but fairness and justice.\\nDavis:\\xa0Adam Schiff released a report about his committee’s impeachment investigation. Why do you think he hasn’t testified yet?\\nHice:\\xa0He needs to. He absolutely needs to. He is the architect behind this whole sham. He is the one that put it together and hopefully he will be required to provide testimony under oath if this goes on to the Senate. Hopefully his day of reckoning will come. \\nBut just for an example, when all of this started, it was Adam Schiff who basically was saying the whistleblower was … You would think the whistleblower was the most important person in the world at that time, and we have information, we have found a needle so to speak, and Adam Schiff was touting, and Nancy Pelosi, this whistleblower was going to testify in the very near future. Then it became known that Adam Schiff and his staff and/or his staff had been coordinating with the whistleblower on this whole thing.\\nIn fact, the whistleblower was not even a whistleblower until after he or she met with Schiff and his staff and they convinced that individual to come forward as a whistleblower. \\nOnce that information became known, then all of a sudden Adam Schiff did not want that whistleblower to testify and he started going to individuals who [had], again, hearsay, second-, third-, fourth-hand information. Many of the witnesses who came forward had zero information whatsoever. No fat witnesses have been brought forth from this whole thing. \\nAnd you and I, [we] cannot get a speeding ticket on second-hand information, but this whole process has been, “We’re going to impeach the president on ‘He said, she said that they heard someone thought this, that, and it.\\'” It is absolute insanity what the Democrats are dragging the American people through.\\nDavis:\\xa0Are you concerned that this could create a “cry wolf” effect where you impeach the president, we impeached in the ’90s, now we we’re impeaching President Trump? Eventually, the American people might just think, “Oh impeachment, that’s a partisan thing.”\\nHice:\\xa0Well, that’s certainly what it is now. And that is part of the risk that we are facing with impeachment. Impeachment is supposed to be for serious high crimes and misdemeanors and there is none of that involved here. \\nIn fact, already, Democrats are saying that if this impeachment fails, they are going to turn around and impeach him again. And it just goes back to their attempt to impeach him the day after he was inaugurated, before he had ever had an opportunity to do anything wrong. … \\nAnd listen, just because you don’t like a president, that’s fine, but that is not an impeachable offense. The Democrats here are trying to impeach someone they don’t like and they don’t like his policies. They are fearful he is going to be reelected, and so they’re only out is to try to impeach him and they’re doing anything they can. So yeah, I think this sets an extremely dangerous precedent for the whole impeachment process for future administrations.\\nDavis:\\xa0Well, shifting to something that Congress has more traditionally focused on, and that’s spending. It is December, which means you and your colleagues are going to be voting on a bunch of spending measures or depending how it shakes out, one big spending measure. We’ll see. \\nSo House Democrats are packing these bills with lots of progressive items that I would imagine are just going to get taken out in the Senate. Do you think they’re going to be successful?\\nHice:\\xa0Yeah. I hope they will. You say there’s going to be a bunch of spending measures, whether it’s a bunch of measures or one big measure. What we do know, it’s a bunch of spending and a bunch of unnecessary spending. And yeah, hopefully the Senate will help us get rid of a lot of the stuff, but look, this is another example of the lack of ability. In fact, the absolute inability of the Democrats to legislate and to lead. \\nWe have had spending issues. We have known for the entire year that the government was going to run out of money on the 20th. They did nothing all year long. They were focused on impeachment. Same is true with funding our military and we have a host of other issues … lowering drug prices, for example, USMCA [United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement], all these things all year long, the Democrats have done absolutely nothing.\\nAnd when the president tags them as the “Do-Nothing Dems,” he is spot on. They have done absolutely nothing. \\nNow we come to the end of the year and we have spending measures that need to be passed. We have funding the military … needs to be passed and there is no telling what kind of garbage is going to be placed in those spending bills. \\nBut again, we are going to be coming back right before Christmas having battles when everyone’s wanting to be home with their families for Christmas. And the Democrats are hopeful that during that pressure that people will cave and just pass whatever they put on the table. And I can tell you, there’s a bunch of us who that is not going to be enough. We’re going to be fighting tooth and nail to limit … the size and scope and spending of government.\\nDavis:\\xa0Well, we tend to see more and more short-term continuing resolution bills instead of these yearlong appropriations bills, and that’s become really a pattern in the last five, 10 years in Congress. How did we get there and what’s the problem in Congress that’s keeping Congress from actually passing long-term bills?\\nHice:\\xa0You’ve got appropriators who, I mean, they have struggled. Everything has become so partisan. We are living in an environment where partisanship is the rule of the day. And so it becomes increasingly difficult to find agreement on these massive spending bills when it’s so intensely charged with partisan politics. And that becomes even more of an issue in the Senate, but that is driving all of this. \\nSo … it becomes as partisan as it is absent the best interest of the United States, but more the best interest of our partisan party politics. Then what gets put into these bills is all sorts of measures that are advancing political agendas rather than advancing that which is in the best interest of the United States as a whole.\\nAnd so you have, for example, in an NDAA [National Defense Authorization Act] bill—a spending bill to fund our military—we now have in a military funding bill a measure that’s going to give parental leave and all this sort of stuff to every federal employee, right? So that’s partisan. If we’re going to deal with a military spending bill, then let’s deal with just military issues. \\nBut that’s what happens when everything becomes partisan party-driven. All these spending measures start getting heaped with partisan party agenda, political agenda measures that are placed in them and that becomes poison pills for a number of people and shuts the process down.\\nDavis:\\xa0Would you say that House leadership has too much control over the legislative process, that the committees that you’re on need to have more power?\\nHice:\\xa0Absolutely. Yeah. And that’s where a lot of the problem is as well. … we have committees that are assigned the responsibility to do different things, whatever it was within the jurisdiction of X, Y, Z committee. And those committees need to be given the authority to do their work and to submit that work to the Congress as a whole for a vote. Instead, leadership more often than not dictates what is going to be done even within committee work. \\nAnd so yeah, … that in itself becomes a very partisan issue because leadership of whatever party is in control too often, is dictating everything that’s taking place, even in committee work.\\nDavis:\\xa0All right. Well, we’ll see what happens with the spending bills and of course impeachment and everything else. Congressman Jody Hice, I want to plug your podcast one more time because our listeners should check it out. It’s the “Freedom Caucus Podcast.” Congressman, thank you for your time.\\nHice:\\xa0Well, thank you.

       " 'President Donald Trump rebuffed congressional efforts\\nto withdraw U.S. support from the war in Yemen on Tuesday, vetoing a bill that\\nwould have forced the U.S. to cease support for the Saudi-led Arab coalition\\nfighting against Iran-backed Houthi rebels.\\nIn his veto\\nstatement, Trump explained:\\nThis resolution is an unnecessary, dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities, endangering the lives of American citizens and brave service members, both today and in the future.\\nTrump clearly had strong legal, constitutional, and policy reasons for exercising his veto. \\nFor starters, his statement challenged the use of the War Powers Act as a basis for the legislation, S.J. Res. 7, because U.S. military forces were not directly engaged in hostilities in Yemen apart from occasional military operations against al-Qaeda and associated forces, which were explicitly exempted from the legislation. As the president said: \\xa0\\nThis joint resolution is unnecessary because, apart from counterterrorism operations against al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and ISIS, the United States is not engaged in hostilities in or affecting Yemen.\\nTrump also sought to protect his constitutional authority\\nas commander-in-chief of the armed forces, as have many past presidents\\nconfronted with war powers challenges. His veto statement declared:\\nS.J. Res. 7 is also dangerous.\\xa0The Congress should not seek to prohibit certain tactical operations, such as in-flight refueling, or require military engagements to adhere to arbitrary timelines.\\xa0Doing so would interfere with the president’s constitutional authority as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and could endanger our service members by impairing their ability to efficiently and effectively conduct military engagements and to withdraw in an orderly manner at the appropriate time.\\nA\\nBlunt Instrument That Rewards Iran\\nTrump’s veto is also strongly justified on policy\\ngrounds. The Yemen war resolution from Congress is a blunt instrument that\\ncould have inflicted severe collateral\\ndamage on a range of U.S. national interests in the Middle East. \\nIt would have resulted in abandoning allies that are\\nfighting in Yemen to defend themselves and to restore the internationally recognized government of Yemen, which was\\nousted by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in 2015 in a bloody coup that violated\\na\\xa0U.N.-brokered\\nceasefire.\\nThe Trump\\nadministration has already stopped the aerial refueling of Saudi warplanes\\ninvolved in the Yemen conflict and called for a negotiated settlement. But the United\\nStates cannot afford to desert its allies and hope for the best. Undermining\\nthe Yemeni government and the Saudi-led coalition would make U.N.-brokered\\nefforts to reach an acceptable political settlement much more difficult.\\nIt is\\nno\\nsecret that many in Congress saw the vote as a means of punishing the Saudi\\ngovernment for its involvement\\nin the death of Jamal Khashoggi last October. But the measure would have punished\\nnot just Saudi Arabia, but also the government of Yemen, and other countries\\nfighting against the Houthis in the Saudi-led coalition: the United Arab\\nEmirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Senegal, and Sudan.\\nAn end to U.S. support would also benefit\\nIran, the Houthis’ chief source of support. Iran has sought to\\ntransform the Houthi Ansar Allah movement into the “Hezbollah of Yemen”—a\\npermanent threat to regional stability and security that directly conflicts\\nwith U.S. interests.\\nIran has illegally transferred sophisticated ballistic\\nmissiles, drones, and remote-controlled boat bombs to the Houthis, who have\\nused them to target cities, airports, and other civilian targets in Saudi\\nArabia and the United Arab Emirates.\\nGiven the potential consequences of the U.S. abandoning\\nits allies, it’s no wonder the Pentagon\\nand State\\nDepartment strongly pushed for continued support for the Saudi-led\\ncoalition.\\nCongress lacks the votes to override Trump’s veto, so\\nhis policy will stand.

       " 'Caught up in a\\nconflict between long-standing NATO ally Turkey and a recently engaged Kurdish\\ntactical partner in Syria, the Trump administration has accommodated the\\nlegitimate security interests of Turkey by staging a partial pullback of U.S.\\nspecial operations forces in northeastern Syria. \\nIt did so to get out of the way of a Turkish intervention launched Wednesday. \\nAlthough critics of the Trump administration have rushed to denounce the decision as a “sellout” of the Syrian Kurds, that’s not true. Washington received no payoff from Ankara for stepping aside, and is not “abandoning the Kurds,” as many critics contend. \\xa0\\nWashington’s ad hoc partnership with Syrian Kurds never included a commitment to help them fight Turkey, only to fight the Islamic State, the terrorist army also known as ISIS.\\nThe United States still supports Syrian Kurds against ISIS, just as it supports Iraqi Kurds and the Iraqi government against ISIS. But Washington has remained neutral with regard to Turkey’s complaints about the threats Syrian Kurds pose to Turkey.\\xa0 \\nTo be more specific, the Pentagon continues to support the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces against ISIS. It has declined, however, to work with the largest Kurdish armed faction within the those forces, the People’s Protection Units (YPG in its Kurdish acronym) to resist the Turkish intervention.\\nIn geopolitical terms, that’s a logical and necessary decision.\\nTrump Warns Turkey’s President\\nTurkey is a long-term strategic ally that exercises major influence in the Middle East.\\xa0The YPG is an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK in its Kurdish acronym), a U.S.-designated terrorist group that has waged war against Turkey off and on since 1984 in a bloody separatist insurrection that has claimed more than 40,000 lives.\\nAlthough the\\nObama and Trump administrations accepted the YPG as a newfound tactical ally in\\nthe war against ISIS, neither administration embraced the YPG/PKK agenda\\nregarding Turkey. \\nBoth\\nadministrations stressed U.S. cooperation with the Syrian Democratic Forces, an\\nad hoc anti-ISIS coalition in which the YPG influence was diluted by the\\nparticipation of Arab factions opposed to ISIS.\\nPresident Donald Trump on Oct. 7 warned Turkey against going “off limits” in Syria, and has threatened to apply economic sanctions if Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ignores the warning.\\xa0\\nThe president doubled down on the sanctions threat Friday by authorizing the Treasury Department to prepare “significant sanctions” against Turkey, if necessary. \\xa0\\nThat’s a far cry from giving Ankara a “green light,” as some critics contend. \\nWashington also stands ready to act as an intermediary between its Syrian Kurdish partners and Ankara. After Turkey has secured its border, a possibility exists that the United States can broker an understanding that could mitigate friction between the two.\\nNor is the Trump administration removing all U.S. troops from Syria at this time.\\xa0The Pentagon has pulled back about 50 special operations troops from the Turkish-Syrian border, and up to 230 U.S. troops—out of the roughly 1,000 deployed in Syria—have been redeployed to the south, but remain in eastern Syria. \\xa0\\nDisagreements Over Buffer Zone\\xa0 \\nThe United States had been negotiating with Turkey on creating a buffer zone in northeastern Syria, in part to avert a unilateral Turkish intervention, which Ankara long had threatened. \\nBut Erdogan, apparently frustrated over the failure of Washington to accede to his demand for a zone 20 miles deep and 300 miles long along Turkey’s border, pulled the plug on the negotiations.\\xa0 \\nThings came to a head Oct. 6, when Erdogan told Trump in a phone call that Turkey was determined to cross the border.\\xa0After Erdogan stated that he would unilaterally establish the zone by force, Trump acquiesced and pulled U.S. troops out of harm’s way.\\nIf that order had\\nnot been given, there was a significant risk that U.S. troops would have been\\ncaught up in the fighting or even drawn into a military clash with Turkey.\\xa0 \\nAlthough there has been much handwringing over the administration’s failure to support the Kurds against Turkey, it’s difficult to see how battling a NATO ally would have preserved American credibility as an ally. \\nPentagon officials on Tuesday denied breathless press reports that defense officials had been blindsided by the president’s action, revealing that Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, actually had participated in the president’s phone call with Erdogan.\\nWhat some U.S. officials may have been surprised by was Trump’s tweet about a total U.S. withdrawal from Syria to end what he called “endless wars.” They know that the enemy gets a vote in ending any war, and ISIS by no means has given up fighting. \\nHolding ISIS at Bay\\nU.S. vigilance will be necessary to block the terror group’s comeback. Trump must listen to his national security team and avoid declaring a premature end to war against ISIS.\\xa0 \\nISIS has returned\\nto its underground roots, but remains a potent threat to regional security and a long-term\\nthreat to U.S. security if it can regroup.\\xa0\\nThe Islamist extremist forces that morphed into ISIS already made a disastrous\\ncomeback in Iraq in 2014 and could do so again in Syria.\\xa0 \\nThe underlying\\npolitical conditions that facilitated the rise of ISIS remain in Syria—anarchy,\\ndysfunctional government, and the systematic repression meted out by the Syrian\\nregime of Bashar Assad. Washington must be careful not to contribute to a power\\nvacuum that would make an ISIS resurgence easier.\\nThe inspector general\\nfor the coalition to defeat ISIS warned in a report in August that ISIS has\\nestablished “resurgent cells” in Syria and launched bombings, assassinations,\\nkidnappings, and suicide attacks in areas liberated by the Syrian Democratic\\nForces.\\nTurkey is not in\\na position to guarantee that ISIS will not return. It would have to fight its\\nway through the Kurds to get at ISIS.\\xa0 \\nErdogan, who has turned\\na blind eye to the infiltration of foreign Islamist extremists into Syria\\nthrough Turkey, always has viewed the Kurds as a bigger threat to Turkey than\\nISIS.\\nFor better or worse, the Syrian Democratic Forces are a necessary partner in the struggle against ISIS.\\xa0Not only does it have skilled and motivated fighters on the ground, but it controls more than 20 prisons and camps that hold about 12,000 ISIS fighters and 58,000 of their family members and supporters.\\nBottom Line: Diplomacy Needed\\nThe United States\\nwill have to withdraw from Syria eventually. The real issue is whether Washington has made arrangements\\nto adequately protect U.S. interests; namely, preventing an ISIS resurgence,\\nblocking expansion of Iranian influence, and reaching a political settlement in\\nSyria that eases the humanitarian situation and allows the return of refugees.\\nThe Turkish\\nintervention complicates efforts to attain those goals, but does not make them\\nimpossible to achieve. \\nIt’s not too late to salvage an acceptable situation in eastern Syria if the administration can tamp down the fighting between Turkey and the  People’s Protection Units and maintain counterterrorism ties with the Syrian Democratic Forces.\\nWashington should push for a cease-fire in northeastern Syria and reach a clear understanding with Ankara about the size and purpose of Turkey’s new buffer zone. \\nThe long-term goal\\nshould be to broker a sustainable understanding between Ankara and the Syrian\\nKurds, similar to the understanding that it brokered between Ankara and Iraqi\\nKurds.\\nWithout such an\\nunderstanding, Turkey’s intervention will push the Syrian Kurds into the arms\\nof Russia and the Assad regime.

Protesters breached embassy walls in Baghdad and set fires and damaged property in response to a U.S. airstrike on Iranian-backed militias Sunday that killed 25.\\xa0\\nThe killing of Suleimani already has widened the partisan divide in the United States.\\nTrump noted on Twitter: “Iran never won a war, but never lost a negotiation!”\\nIran never won a war, but never lost a negotiation!\\n….of PROTESTERS killed in Iran itself. While Iran will never be able to properly admit it, Soleimani was both hated and feared within the country. They are not nearly as saddened as the leaders will let the outside world believe. He should have been taken out many years ago!\\n“General Qassem Soleimani has killed or badly wounded thousands of Americans over an extended period of time, and was plotting to kill many more…but got caught!” Trump tweeted, using a variant spelling of the general’s name. “He was directly and indirectly responsible for the death of millions of people, including the recent large number….of PROTESTERS killed in Iran itself. While Iran will never be able to properly admit it, Soleimani was both hated and feared within the country. They are not nearly as saddened as the leaders will let the outside world believe. He should have been taken out many years ago!”\\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., criticized the president’s action for leaving Congress out of the decision and for potentially provoking more terror.\\xa0\\n“American leaders’ highest priority is to protect American lives and interests. But we cannot put the lives of American service members, diplomats, and others further at risk by engaging in provocative and disproportionate actions,” Pelosi said in a written statement late Thursday. “Tonight’s airstrike risks provoking further dangerous escalation of violence.\\xa0 America—and the world—cannot afford to have tensions escalate to the point of no return.”\\nPelosi added:\\xa0\\nThe administration has conducted tonight’s strikes in Iraq targeting high-level Iranian military officials and killing Iranian Quds Force Commander Qasem Soleimani without an Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) against Iran.\\xa0Further, this action was taken without the consultation of the Congress.\\nFor the past 21 years,  Suleimani was commander of the Quds Force, a division of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps focused on military and spying operations outside Iran.  \\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said Suleimani, 62, was in the process of preparing additional attacks on U.S. diplomats in the region.\\nThe State Department has warned Americans to leave Iraq.\\xa0\\n#Iraq: U.S. citizens in Iraq or concerned about loved ones in Iraq can contact the Department of State at 202-501-4444 or toll-free in the U.S. at 888-407-4747.

What the administration must offer now is firm diplomacy backed by the continuing, credible threat of the use of military force. President Trump has wisely shown that he will act with the full powers of his office when American interests are threatened, and the extremist regime in Tehran would be wise to take notice.\\nHouse Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith, D-Wash., said he was troubled by the “chain of events” that might now occur.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“I do not want an open war with Iran, and neither do the American people. However, the absence of a coherent strategy has strained an already tense relationship between Washington and Tehran,” Smith said in a prepared statement.\\xa0\\n“It appears that in lieu of a strategy, the Trump administration has chosen military escalation. The administration must clearly articulate how this action, and potential future actions, will protect U.S. global interests while ensuring the safety and security of our personnel in the region and worldwide.”\\nHowever, Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and frequent Trump critic, strongly supported the administration’s action to take out the head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\\xa0\\n“This is very simple: General Soleimani is dead because he was an evil bastard who murdered Americans. The president made the brave and right call, and Americans should be proud of our service members who got the job done,” Sasse said.\\xa0\\n“Tehran is on edge—the mullahs have already slaughtered at least a thousand innocent Iranians—and before they lash out further they should know that the U.S. military can bring any and all of these IRGC butchers to their knees.”',\n",
       " 'Michael Johns Jr.\\n/\\n@michaeldjohnsjr\\n\\nMichael Johns Jr. is a member of the Young Leaders Program at The Heritage Foundation.\\nPresident Donald Trump’s new round of sanctions against Iran is the latest salvo in a wide-ranging effort to pressure the regime in Tehran. The goal is to halt Iran’s exportation of terror and subversion and force Iran to accept tighter restrictions on its nuclear program. \\nThe sanctions announced Monday add to an\\nalready extensive set of punitive economic measures and specifically target\\nIran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and several top officials in his\\nregime.\\nIn addition to sanctioning the Office of the Supreme Leader, which is estimated to control a global network of companies worth $100-$200 billion, the Treasury Department sanctioned eight senior leaders of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, including the leaders of the Revolutionary Guard’s navy, aerospace, and ground forces.\\nThe president imposed the new sanctions after canceling military strikes that he had ordered against Revolutionary Guard missile batteries in retaliation for the June 19 shoot-down of a U.S. Navy surveillance drone in international air space. \\nThe sanctions signal the Trump administration’s determination to continue its “maximum pressure” campaign against Tehran.\\nNot surprisingly, the sanctions triggered howls of protest in Tehran. President Hassan Rouhani denounced them as “outrageous and idiotic” and charged that the White House “was afflicted by mental retardation.” \\nThe spokesman for Iran’s Foreign Ministry said the sanctions “[mean] closing the doors of diplomacy by the U.S.”\\xa0 \\nTrump responded with a series of tweets on Tuesday, including: \\nIran’s very ignorant and insulting statement, put out today, only shows that they do not understand reality. Any attack by Iran on anything American will be met with great and overwhelming force. In some areas, overwhelming will mean obliteration. No more John Kerry & Obama!\\n….Iran’s very ignorant and insulting statement, put out today, only shows that they do not understand reality. Any attack by Iran on anything American will be met with great and overwhelming force. In some areas, overwhelming will mean obliteration. No more John Kerry & Obama!\\nJohn Bolton, Trump’s national security adviser, blamed Iran for dragging its feet on diplomacy: \\nThe president has held the door open to real negotiations to completely and verifiably eliminate Iran’s nuclear weapons program, its pursuit of ballistic missile delivery systems, its support for international terrorism, and other malign behavior worldwide. All that Iran needs to do is to walk through that open door.\\nMaximum Pressure vs. Maximum\\nBlackmail\\nThe slow-motion confrontation between Iran\\nand the U.S. is dramatically accelerating as the Trump administration’s “maximum\\npressure” campaign takes effect, forcing Tehran to pay an increasingly painful\\nprice for its hostile foreign policy and refusal to return\\nto nuclear negotiations.\\xa0 \\nThe World Bank estimates that Iran is on track for negative 4.5% real gross domestic product growth—the second-worst projection in the world on a key metric of economic health. \\nIran’s inflation rate has risen sharply from about 10% in mid-2018 to about 52% in April 2019, as the Iranian rial plummets in value and private spending contracts. \\nClearly, U.S. sanctions have had a\\ndevastating impact, even without\\nEuropean support.\\nExtensive economic sanctions against Iran were initially announced in Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s first major policy speech, which was given at The Heritage Foundation in May 2018. \\nThe new policy, he promised, would impose “unprecedented financial pressure” against Tehran unless it “halted its uranium enrichment program and hostile regional policies.” \\nUnwilling to give up on either, Iran is\\nnow paying an escalating price for its brazen commitment to fomenting\\ninstability and violence in the Middle East and beyond.\\nNow barred from export markets and the international banking system, the mullahs are slowly being denied the resources they need to continue funding essential parts of their dangerous agenda. \\nTehran’s draft budget for 2019-2020 is evidence of a regime on the ropes: Among its many austerity measures, the regime planned to implement a 28% cut in funding to its military budget, including a 17% reduction for the Revolutionary Guard, which the State Department rightly designated as a foreign terrorist organization this April. \\xa0\\nThat’s a significant blow for the Revolutionary Guard, which is a core part of Iran’s grand strategy, charged with acting as the sword and shield of Iran’s Islamic revolution. \\nIran’s Shadow War\\nThe Revolutionary Guard carried out a series of attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman over the past two months, attacks that are part of Iran’s policy of pushing back against U.S. sanctions with veiled threats against Arab oil exporters and the flow of gulf oil. \\nOn May 12, four oil tankers carrying oil exports from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates—two adversaries that stood to gain materially by providing alternatives to Iranian oil—were sabotaged with limpet mines.\\xa0 \\nAfter Washington sanctioned Iran’s\\npetrochemical exports, two petrochemical\\ntankers carrying Arab petrochemical exports were sabotaged\\nwith limpet mines on June 13, and Revolutionary Guard personnel were videotaped\\nremoving an unexploded limpet mine from the hull of one of the ships by a U.S.\\nNavy helicopter.\\xa0 \\nTo minimize the chances of further\\nembarrassing revelations, the Revolutionary Guard then shot down a U.S. Navy\\nsurveillance drone on June 19 and falsely claimed it had strayed into Iranian\\nair space. \\nThe Revolutionary Guard’s low-intensity warfare is a calibrated, semi-clandestine campaign of intimidation aimed at expanding Tehran’s leverage by signaling resistance, exploiting the vulnerability of gulf oil exports, and threatening to escalate threats against Arab oil-exporting countries aligned with the United States.\\xa0 \\nThe goal is to force the Trump\\nadministration to back down from its maximum pressure campaign and drive a\\nwedge between the U.S. and its European allies, which Tehran hopes will be\\nmotivated to help shield Iran from U.S. sanctions.\\xa0 \\nBut this blackmail campaign is unlikely to\\nsucceed. Iran’s attacks on oil tankers will not boost its own oil exports or\\nsolve its sanctions problems, though they could backfire spectacularly by\\ntriggering a costly war with the United States or a diplomatic backlash by\\noil-importing countries threatened by Iran’s oil blackmail tactics.\\xa0 \\nTrump, secure in the knowledge that his\\nstrategy is paying dividends by penalizing Iran’s hostile policies, has doubled\\ndown on his pressure campaign by imposing new economic sanctions and approving U.S.\\ncyberattacks against Revolutionary Guard military\\ncomputers that control rocket and missile launchers. \\xa0\\nDisabling Iranian missile sites through cyberattacks, rather than conventional military attacks, has several advantages. \\nIt underscores to Tehran that it is vulnerable to additional counter-threats, casts doubt on its military capabilities, and helps reassure nervous U.S. allies that Washington seeks a diplomatic resolution, not a war with Iran.\\xa0 \\nStill, Iran’s ruthless regime remains on a\\ncollision course with the United States. If it continues to reject diplomacy in\\nfavor of violence and intimidation, then a military clash and perhaps a full-scale\\nwar is increasingly likely.\\xa0 \\nFor more information about this\\ntopic:\\nWhere the U.S.-Iran Confrontation Is Heading\\n\\nSanctioning Revolutionary Guard as Terrorist Group WillHit Iran Hard.

       " 'In a new resolution, a bipartisan group of senators is calling for the United States to end its involvement—specifically its support of Saudi Arabia—in the Yemen conflict.\\nOn Wednesday, the Senate voted 63-37 to pass a procedural measure that will clear the way for a floor debate on the issue next week.\\nThe push comes largely in response to the recent murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\\nThe Trump administration has banned 21 Saudi suspects in that murder from entering the U.S., imposed sanctions on 17 Saudi officials, and expressed its willingness to take further action if warranted by ongoing investigations. Many senators seek to do more to punish the Saudis, even if it means sacrificing the interests of the Yemeni government and making a negotiated settlement of the conflict more difficult.\\nThe killing of Khashoggi was certainly abhorrent, but ending U.S. support for the multinational coalition in Yemen is not the proper solution. It risks dangerously conflating two separate issues and would inevitably trigger unintended consequences that would undermine U.S. national security interests in the region.\\nSenators must remember that Saudi Arabia is not the only belligerent in Yemen. A cutoff of U.S. support would also hurt the elected and internationally recognized government of Yemen, which was ousted by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in 2015 in a bloody coup that violated a U.N.-brokered cease-fire.\\nWithdrawing U.S. support would also harm the interests of other U.S. allies fighting in Yemen, including the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.\\nThe war in Yemen is complex. Those who rush to blame Saudi Arabia entirely for the suffering of the Yemeni people ignore the war crimes and heavy-handed treatment meted out by the Houthis to their opponents and the ruthless role that Iran plays in supporting the Houthi Ansar Allah (“Supporters of Allah”) movement, a Shia Islamist extremist group.\\nThe Saudis are rightly criticized for not doing more to prevent civilian casualties as they target Ansar Allah positions. But the Houthis should not be given a free pass for deliberately targeting civilian targets in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates with increasingly sophisticated Iranian ballistic missiles.\\nAnsar Allah also deserves criticism for its violent role in destabilizing Yemen and creating the conditions that led to the current humanitarian disaster. Ansar Allah regularly attacks the Saudi border, launches missile strikes into Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and diverts international medical and food aid to favor its own supporters and sells on the black market.\\nAnsar Allah also has targeted U.S. Navy vessels, those of allied nations, and civilian shipping in the Red Sea with Iranian-supplied missiles, gunboat attacks, and boat bombs. Undermining the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen risks exacerbating this threat to international shipping and giving Iran the opportunity to threaten oil shipments through the Bab al-Mandab Strait, just as it has threatened to do in the Strait of Hormuz.\\nThose who advocate withdrawing support for Saudi Arabia apparently believe that they can somehow end the current conflict in Yemen through a one-sided strategy that penalizes allies and boosts Ansar Allah, a group that chants “Death to America” and looks more like Hezbollah, Iran’s Lebanese proxy group, every day.\\nNever mind that Saudi Arabia is supporting the internationally recognized government of Yemen in this effort. Never mind that leaving Ansar Allah to run amuck will not bring an end to the humanitarian suffering, but only prolong it.\\nThe U.S. currently extends only limited support to Saudi Arabia in Yemen centered on intelligence and information sharing. There are no U.S. troops involved in combat operations, except for occasional commando raids and air strikes against Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, a Sunni terrorist group that continues to target the U.S. homeland, as well as Saudi Arabia, France, and other countries.\\nThe Trump administration already has stopped the aerial refueling of Saudi warplanes involved in the Yemen conflict and called for a negotiated settlement. But the United States cannot afford to abandon its allies and hope for the best. Undermining the Yemeni government and the Saudi-led coalition would make an acceptable political settlement impossible.\\nThe Yemeni government and Saudi Arabia will continue to fight this war with or without U.S. support. Those who would connect two unrelated issues, condemn Saudi involvement, and ignore Iran’s hostile role inside Yemen will only do more harm to innocent Yemeni civilians and empower Iran and its Yemeni proxies.',\n",

Erdogan, having heard the objections of Congress, multiple Pentagon officials, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, has consciously chosen Moscow over the concerns of NATO. \\nThe S-400 system, designed by Russia to shoot down NATO\\naircraft, poses a clear and present risk to U.S. national security if deployed on\\nTurkish soil, as it could expose the stealth capabilities of U.S.-designed F-35\\nfighter jets, which Turkey also has contracted to purchase.\\nPresident Donald Trump rightly responded on July 17 that\\nthe U.S. would immediately\\nhalt those F-35 sales, protecting one of the most important\\ninstruments of U.S. military power. Sanctions also soon could be imposed on the\\ncountry under the 2017 Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act,\\nwhich provides a large menu of potential options to penalize countries that buy\\narms from Russia.\\nBut the U.S. isn’t alone in its frustrations with Erdogan. Last\\nweek, he reignited a longstanding conflict over the territorial status of\\nCyprus, directing Turkish ships to begin energy exploration in Cypriot waters on\\nbehalf of a Turkish-led government on the island that only it recognizes.\\nThe European Union, which also was clear in its objections\\nto such a confrontational decision, immediately suspended $154\\nmillion in aid to Turkey and asked its investment bank to review hundreds of\\nmillions more in current lending to Ankara.\\nThese are just the latest in years of accelerating anti-Western sentiment in Erdogan’s manner and behavior, which has classified him less as an ally and more as a “frenemy” in recent years. \\nHis repudiation of Western interests and values isn’t just a rhetorical tool: Turkey continually has frustrated U.S. strategic objectives in Syria and complicated efforts to mount an international campaign to contain Iran. \\nHe probably sees his defiance of the U.S. and the EU as helping bolster his popularity at home as his political support wanes—most recently and notably in his AK Party’s stronghold city of Istanbul.\\nErdogan’s decisions to publicly break with the U.S. and its NATO allies, even as Turkey continues in name as a U.S. ally and maintains its petition for membership in the EU, have led Washington and the EU to levy sanctions against Turkey. The already-struggling Turkish economy will falter further as Erdogan continues to isolate himself from his international partners.\\nTrump’s expulsion of Turkey from the F-35 deal is a strong and appropriate step that sends a clear message to Ankara and protects U.S. national security. \\nThe Trump administration may impose sanctions against Turkey as well, under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, but as the discussion of punitive responses develops, the administration should take care to penalize adverse Turkish policies without breaking NATO ties. \\nDespite Erdogan’s prickly leadership and increasingly anti-Western tone, Turkey remains an ally on many security issues, and the U.S. air base in Incirlik remains a valuable military asset in the Middle East. \\nErdogan won’t rule forever. As much as he would like to remain in power for life, his party’s dramatic Istanbul election defeat shows his political support is declining and he is likely to face greater challenges in future elections. \\nAs lamentable as it is that Ankara has drifted steadily away from the West under his leadership, Erdogan will pass—painfully, like a kidney stone—and a post-Erdogan Turkey should have the opportunity to recommit to its Western alliances instead of being forced into Moscow’s embrace.

       " 'The U.S. airstrike Thursday night that killed Iranian Gen. Qassim Suleimani was a bold and decisive effort to remove a key Iranian military and terrorist leader at a time when Iran appeared to be poised to escalate the crisis in Iraq by plotting an “imminent attack,” according to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\\nSuleimani was the mastermind behind Iran’s low-intensity warfare and terrorist campaign against the U.S. and its allies for many years. As the leader of the Quds Force, the elite special-operations wing of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Suleimani essentially served as Iran’s viceroy for Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon.\\nHe\\nrose to prominence inside Iran and in the region by supervising Iran’s expanding\\nnetwork of surrogate militias, terrorist groups, and radical Islamist\\nallies.\\nHis\\nQuds Force orchestrated the formation, arming, training, and operations of a\\nforeign legion of Iraqi, Syrian, Lebanese, Afghan, Yemeni, and other militant\\ngroups that Tehran has deployed to advance its imperial agenda and to export\\nIran’s Islamist revolution.\\xa0 \\nIran long has used surrogate militias to do its dirty work in Iraq. One of the terrorists killed along with Suleimani was Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the leader of Kataib Hezbollah (“Brigades of the Party of God”). \\nLike Suleimani, al-Muhandis was designated as a terrorist by the United States.\\xa0 He was convicted and condemned to death in absentia in Kuwait for his involvement in the 1983 bombings of the U.S. and French embassies in Kuwait City. \\nThis radical Iraqi militia—modeled on Lebanon’s Hezbollah terrorist militia (which Suleimani also helped to build up)—was formed in 2007 as a proxy group under the direct command of Suleimani’s Quds Force. Kataib Hezbollah was one of the Iraqi militias that the Quds Force employed to kill more than 600 U.S. troops in Iraq from 2003 to 2011, according to Pentagon estimates.\\nKataib\\nHezbollah also was responsible for numerous rocket attacks in recent months on\\nU.S. troops in Iraq, including the Dec. 27 rocket attack that killed an\\nAmerican citizen and provoked the current crisis.\\xa0 The U.S. retaliated for the rocket attack\\nwith airstrikes against five Kataib Hezbollah bases and weapons-storage sites\\nin Iraq and Syria on Dec. 29. \\nThis prompted Kataib Hezbollah and other Iran-backed militias to mobilize a mob that besieged the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad on Dec. 30-31 and tried to set in on fire. Suleimani arrived at Baghdad airport shortly thereafter, undoubtedly planning to orchestrate more dangerous attacks on U.S. personnel in Iraq.\\xa0 \\nSuleimani’s death is a huge loss for Iran’s regime and its Iraqi proxies. It also is a major operational and psychological victory for the United States. \\nThe strong U.S. military response and demonstrated intelligence capacity to identify, track, and target Suleimani’s movements should bolster U.S. deterrence of Iranian aggression in the long run, although Iran is likely to escalate attacks in Iraq and elsewhere in the immediate aftermath of the strike.\\nBut as Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said Thursday before the strike: “The game has changed.”\\xa0\\xa0Washington will no longer tolerate attacks by Iran-backed proxy groups without inflicting a heavy price, not only on them, but on Iran, which historically has acted with impunity by conducting a shadow war through surrogates. \\nThis policy of holding Tehran accountable for the attacks of its proxies was announced by the White House in a 2018 statement, after Iranian-backed Iraqi militias attacked American diplomatic facilities in Iraq:\\n\\xa0Over the past few days, we have seen life-threatening attacks in Iraq, including on the United States Consulate in Basra and against the American Embassy compound in Baghdad.\\xa0Iran did not act to stop these attacks by its proxies in Iraq, which it has supported with funding, training, and weapons.\\nThe United States will hold the regime in Tehran accountable for any attack that results in injury to our personnel or damage to United States government facilities.\\xa0America will respond swiftly and decisively in defense of American lives.\\nPresident\\nDonald Trump has repeatedly warned Iranian leaders about the potential\\nconsequences of attacks on Americans. It should be no surprise that he enforced\\nhis own “red line.”\\nThe successful strike against Suleimani is a powerful message to Iranian leaders that their old tactics of “fighting to the last Iraqi” in a shadow war against the U.S. now entail many more risks and costs. If sustained over time, that could alter their cost-benefit calculus and lead them to moderate their hostile and aggressive policies.\\nBut in the immediate aftermath of Suleimani’s death, Tehran is likely to respond on several tracks, as usual. On one track, it will play the victim card and seek to mobilize its Iraqi allies to expel the U.S. military presence through legislation passed by Iraq’s parliament or by a direct request of Iraq’s weak coalition government, which has been infiltrated by Iran’s Iraqi friends.\\nOn\\nanother track, the Quds Force is likely to employ its proxy network on a\\nvariety of fronts to launch terrorist attacks and kidnapping operations to take\\nAmerican hostages.\\xa0\\xa0 \\nTehran also may choose to ratchet up its cyberattacks, assaults on oil tankers, and missile strikes on the energy infrastructure in the Persian Gulf, or accelerate its violations of its nuclear nonproliferation commitments.\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\nHowever,\\nall these tracks now have become increasingly risky. All are unlikely to yield\\nsignificant gains, but sure to provoke even stronger action from the Trump administration.\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe\\nconflict with Iran will continue, but the rules of the game are shifting. \\nFor more information on this topic:\\nU.S. Airstrikes in Mideast—Sending This Clear Message to\\nFriends and Foes Alike \\xa0\\nU.S. Should Boost Deterrence Against Iran \\nHow Protests Undermine Iran and Its Proxies in Iraq and\\nLebanon\\n\\nProtesters in Iraq Have Legitimate Grievances',\n",

Local phone calls in Lebanon are five times more\\nexpensive than local calls in Jordan and 20 times more expensive than in\\nEgypt.\\xa0 \\nNo wonder that imposing the new tax on messaging applications ignited protests by long-suffering Lebanese citizens.\\nCorruption and Mismanagement\\nCorruption allegations have motivated many recent anti-government protests in Algeria, Egypt, and Sudan, but the Lebanese protests most closely resemble the ongoing protests in Iraq.\\nFor the past month, tens of thousands of young Iraqis have staged protests against high unemployment, corruption, and inadequate government services.\\xa0As in Lebanon, the protests increasingly have assumed an anti-Iranian tint as political factions supported by Iran have opposed the protesters’ demands and attacked protesters.\\xa0 \\nAs a result, a strong popular backlash has erupted against Iranian influence. But unlike Iraq, Lebanon has little oil wealth that could be used to fund government reforms.\\xa0 \\nLebanon is facing enormous domestic challenges. Its economy\\nand trade routes have been disrupted by the ongoing war in neighboring Syria. In\\naddition to high unemployment and slow economic growth—projected \\xa0to be 2% in 2019—Lebanon’s national debt has\\nsurged to $86 billion, more than 150% of its gross domestic product, one of the\\nhighest debt ratios in the world.\\nMerely servicing the debt consumes about 45% of government revenues, which has motivated official efforts to find new sources of tax revenue.\\nProtests have remained secular in nature, with\\nChristian, Shiite, and Sunni protesters waving the Lebanese flag and chanting\\nanti-government slogans such as “All of them means all of them,” and calling\\nout political elites who have fueled sectarian tensions for their own benefit. \\nDemonstrations spread across cities in northern\\nLebanon, Beirut, as well as Hezbollah southern strongholds, including Tyre and\\nNabatieh. Surprisingly, southern protesters chanted anti-Hezbollah rhetoric even\\nafter Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, warned against forcing the\\nresignation of the government elite.\\nNasrallah said protesters need to “let this government\\ncontinue but with a new spirit and a new way of working … [learning] its lesson\\nfrom the last two days of popular outburst.” \\nHezbollah supporters also have tried to disrupt the\\nprotests. In a viral video posted on social media, the Lebanese army was seen\\nblocking motorcyclists bearing flags of Hezbollah and Amal, an allied Shiite\\nparty, from entering protest squares in the capital city of Beirut.\\nThe respite was short-lived, though, as Hezbollah and\\nAmal members later attacked\\nprotesters in Beirut. Lebanon remains on edge and could rapidly descend into\\nwidespread political violence if political tensions are not eased soon.\\xa0 \\nNo\\nClear Way Forward\\nIn an effort to calm protests, Hariri announced\\na series of cost-cutting reforms Oct. 21, promising a reduction of government\\nsalaries, a reformed electricity sector, and downsizing and/or cutting of\\nobsolete government institutions such as the Ministry of Information. \\nBut the protesters rejected the concessions as being too little too late, and Hariri was forced to resign.\\nLebanese President Michel Aoun, who is aligned with Hezbollah, may decide not to accept Hariri’s resignation, just as he did in November 2017, when Hariri resigned under pressure from Saudi Arabia.\\nBut if accepted, Hariri’s resignation will prompt negotiations over the appointment of a new prime minister and a reshuffling of the coalition government. It is doubtful, however, that any deal negotiated by Lebanon’s discredited leaders will satisfy the protesters, who have demanded that the government be run by technocrats who are not beholden to sectarian political parties widely regarded as corrupt.\\nRegardless, the wave of protests across the Middle\\nEast underscore the increasing disconnect between political elites and the\\ncitizens they are supposed to represent. \\nLike most of the Arab world, Lebanon’s young people\\nare better educated and more demanding than their parents: 40% of those under 25\\nhave reached the highest levels of the nation’s education system, but the\\nunemployment rate is 37% for those 35 and under. \\nRecognizing the crippling effects of sectarianism, young protesters in the Middle East have rejected such agendas and echoed similar demands: economic opportunity, the purging of corruption, and a systemic overhaul of political systems. Self-interested and unaccountable political parties, the protesters argue,  have failed time and time again to address legitimate popular grievances.',\n",

James Inhofe, R-Okla.; Jack Reed, D-R.I.; James Risch, R-Idaho; and Robert Menendez, D-N.J.; wrote in a New York Times op-ed in early April. \\nYet, despite this widespread U.S. criticism and the Trump administration’s promise of a punitive response, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has called the purchase “a done deal” and has already begun preparing his nation for retaliatory U.S. sanctions once the Russian missile defense system is delivered.\\nCongress\\nis right to oppose the deal. \\nAs was noted last year in The National Interest, the S-400 is a “real game changer” with exceptional anti-aircraft capabilities and a wide range of other advantages, from the ability to detect stealth aircraft to the ability to detect, target, and engage non-stealth aircraft at a greater range than that of its American competitor, the Patriot system. \\nIt shouldn’t come as a surprise that Russia has found no shortage of customers for the S-400. As Moscow prepares to deliver it to Turkey, it also has begun negotiations to sell it to Egypt, India, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. \\nRussia’s\\nsale of the S-400 system to the Turkish government is a direct threat to the\\nnational security interests of both NATO and the U.S. It would draw Turkey, a\\nNATO member state, closer to Russia precisely at a moment when the U.S. is\\nseeking to limit Moscow’s largely malicious meddling in the region. \\nBut the U.S. national interest does not end at the symbolism of the sale. The S-400 system, a Russian invention, would be inoperable with existing NATO weapons systems—and Erdogan has promised to help Russia build the next generation of systems, known as the S-500. \\nThis deal, far from a one-time agreement, could well become a dangerous and lasting partnership, especially as U.S.-Turkey relations have already slipped to “frenemy” status. \\nThe\\nlargest sticking point for the U.S. government, however, has been the prospect\\nof Turkey’s possession of both the S-400 system and U.S.-designed F-35 fighter\\njets simultaneously.\\nTurkey, a relatively new customer, formally received its first four F-35s in June 2018, though the jets still remain in the U.S. at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona, where Turkish pilots are training on them. Those F-35s are part of a much larger deal intended to shore up the capabilities of the Turkish air force.\\nAs\\nthe bipartisan group of U.S. senators noted rightly in their New York Times op-ed,\\nallowing Turkey to obtain the Russian-made S-400 is an “unacceptable risk,\\nbecause its radar system could enable the Russian military to figure out how\\nthe F-35 operates.” \\nSpecifically\\nat risk is the F-35’s stealth capability: The Russian military could\\npotentially study how the jet fighters interact with the S-400 system, working\\naround the stealth technology and betraying a key U.S. strategic advantage\\naround the world. \\nThat’s\\na bona fide threat to national security.\\nWhile\\nthe Pentagon has already paused the delivery of additional F-35s to Ankara,\\nCongress and the State Department seem willing to take even firmer action,\\nincluding canceling the F-35 sale entirely and closing off Turkish parts\\nmanufacturers for the fighter jets in favor of European alternatives.\\nTurkey, which has already invested $125 million in the development of the F-35, could lose part of its defense industrial base that was dedicated to that program. \\nWhat’s\\nmore, the U.S. could impose economic sanctions on Turkey under the 2017\\nCountering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, which recommends\\npunitive economic steps against any countries that buy Russian military\\ntechnology.\\nAlthough Erdogan doubts American resolve, saying that his country will “sooner or later … receive the F-35s,” the prospect of a retaliatory U.S. response has rightly caused Ankara to waver.\\nYet, Turkey seems determined to press on. Erdogan, seemingly unmoved by offers instead to purchase the U.S.-made Patriot air defense system and increasingly toying with anti-American rhetoric, seems to see the Russian relationship as more important. \\nTo be\\nsure, Turkey and Russia are growing ever closer as Turkey seeks solutions for\\nits security challenges and economic woes, but this cooperation is hugely\\ndangerous for the NATO alliance—and therefore, for Turkey itself. \\nErdogan\\nwould do well to understand the reality: NATO is his only real security\\npartner. Vladimir Putin’s Russia is neither interested in, nor benefits from,\\nTurkish security and prosperity. \\nPutin’s\\nefforts to separate Turkey and other Middle Eastern states from their U.S.\\npartnerships are not an attempt to give them a better alternative. They are\\nsingularly focused on driving a wedge between Washington and its NATO and\\nMiddle Eastern allies to counter what he sees as challenges to Russian\\ninfluence.\\nAnkara\\nstill has time to back away from this misguided agreement and embrace its best\\nhope of a lasting security and economic partnership with the U.S. and its other\\nNATO allies. \\nAlthough\\nErdogan called President Donald Trump on May 29 to discuss the S-400 issue,\\nU.S. officials have denied Turkish claims that Trump agreed to establish a\\nbilateral working group to study how to mitigate the risks posed by the Russian\\nweapons system.\\xa0 \\nA Pentagon spokesman rejected those claims. \\n“We have been clear that purchasing the S-400 would create an unacceptable risk because its radar system could provide the Russian military sensitive information on the F-35.\\xa0 Those concerns cannot be mitigated,” Defense Department spokesman Eric Pahon told the Al-Monitor website.\\nIn\\nany event, Trump is unlikely to be receptive to Ankara’s stubborn foot-dragging\\non the issue. The president has spent years lambasting NATO allies and others\\nwho fail to contribute to the security relationship and rely unfairly on the\\nbenevolence of the U.S. government. \\nIn\\nrecent years, Turkey has been one of the worst offenders on both counts. The\\nS-400 system, should it be set up on Turkish soil, would be one of the most\\nobvious betrayals of that trust in decades.',\n",
       " 'People inspect the damage after a missile attack targeted a camp during a military parade in Aden, Yemen, Aug. 1, 2019. (Photo: Wail Shaif/picture alliance/Getty Images)\\n\\nNicole Robinson\\n\\nNicole Robinson is a research assistant in the Allison Center for Foreign Policy at The Heritage Foundation.\\nTwo separate terrorist attacks earlier this month struck the Yemeni governorate of Aden, and those were followed by a third attack in Abyan.\\nAll told, the attacks reportedly killed at\\nleast 68, including security personnel from the United Arab Emirates-backed\\nSecurity Belt Forces, shaking the relative calm in one of the deadliest\\neruptions of violence in southern Yemen in two years. \\nThe Security Belt Forces is an elite\\nparamilitary unit connected to the Southern Transitional Council, a\\nsecessionist political organization calling for southern Yemen’s independence. \\nThe first attack took place Aug. 1 in the Sheikh Othman neighborhood of Aden, when a suicide bomber targeted a security center during the morning lineup. \\nThe death toll was 13, according to the Yemeni\\nMinistry of the Interior. The next day, ISIS claimed responsibility for the\\nattack. \\nYemen’s southern provinces have long been a stronghold\\nfor Islamist extremist groups, and the attacks might point to a growth in\\nextremist presence as the United Arab Emirates takes a less overt role in the\\nconflict.\\nThe second attack, also on Aug. 1, came in\\nthe form of a missile strike that hit a military parade in the al-Jala camp\\nnear the Buraiqa district in Aden, claiming the lives of at least 30 Security\\nBelt personnel and also killing Abu al-Yamama, the leading Yemeni\\ncounterterrorism commander of those forces. \\nThe Iran-backed Shiite Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement released by Brig. Gen. Yehya Sarea, a Houthi military spokesman. He boasted that “the joint operation against the al-Jala camp successfully targeted a military parade for the invaders and mercenaries [of Aden].”\\nHe cited the recent advancement of military\\npositions in the provinces of al-Dhale and Taiz as cause for the attack.\\nThe day after the two attacks, Yemeni security officials say, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula militants stormed al-Mahfad military camp in the governorate of Abyan, taking advantage of the chaos from the attacks in Aden the day before. The incident claimed the lives of at least 19 Security Belt Forces personnel in a foiled attempt to take control of the camp. \\nThe Shabwani Elite—a United Arab\\nEmirates-backed paramilitary unit focused on counterterrorism operations—reportedly\\nhelped assist Abyan security forces to retake the area after it was briefly\\ncaptured. \\nAl-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula subsequently claimed responsibility for the attack. \\nThe U.N. special envoy for Yemen released a statement Aug. 1 on Twitter claiming to be “gravely concerned by the escalation of violence” in Aden, but failing to condemn the attacks. There was no comment by the U.N. special envoy for Yemen about the al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula attack in Abyan the following day. \\nThe three attacks represent a real\\npossibility of escalation in the south from both Houthi rebels and extremist\\ngroups, exposing the possible weakness of local security forces to attacks in\\nthe heart of the areas they control. \\nBoth al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and\\nISIS may be testing the readiness of Security Belt Forces and other local\\nsecurity providers following the recent United Arab Emirates’ drawdown of its\\nmilitary presence. \\nHouthi fighters and extremist militants are likely to continue to strike security infrastructure in the south to further fragment the Saudi-led Arab military coalition and its allies.\\nIf attacks continue on an upward trajectory, from either the Houthis or other Islamic extremists, the U.N. special envoy to Yemen, Martin Griffiths, will face intense pressure from the international community to revive stalled peace talks and seek a viable peace settlement.',\n",
       " 'In a historic move on Monday, Secretary of State Mike\\nPompeo announced the designation of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as\\na foreign terrorist organization. \\nThis is the first time the U.S. has given the\\ndesignation to part of a government.\\nThe designation will enable the U.S. to further ramp\\nup sanctions against Iran’s tyrannical regime under the administration’s\\n“maximum pressure” policy.\\nThe Revolutionary Guard Corps is both the sword and\\nshield of Iran’s Islamic revolution, dating back to 1979. It is charged with\\nattacking Iran’s enemies overseas, supporting Iran’s network of foreign\\nterrorist proxies, and crushing political opposition to Iran’s revolutionary regime\\nat home.\\nLast week, the Pentagon released an updated assessment that blamed Iran’s Revolutionary Guard for enabling Iraqi proxy forces to kill 603 American servicemen in Iraq. That accounts for about 17% of the total deaths of U.S. personnel from 2003 to 2011.\\nThe Revolutionary Guard also controls Iran’s ballistic\\nmissile program, military aspects of its nuclear program, and key portions of\\nIran’s state-dominated economy.\\nThe designation as a foreign terrorist organization will\\nbecome effective next Monday, at which time the U.S. government will gain\\nadditional tools for applying sanctions against the Revolutionary Guards and\\nall foreign entities that do business with them, their subsidiaries, and their\\nfront companies.\\xa0 \\nThis will allow U.S. sanctions to hit harder at strategic sectors of Iran’s economy, since the Revolutionary Guard is extensively involved in Iran’s oil, construction, and defense industries. As CIA director in 2017, Pompeo estimated that the Revolutionary Guard controlled about 20% of Iran’s economy.\\nThese added sanctions will drain away resources that\\ncould be used to export terrorism, thus helping bolster the security of the\\nU.S. and its allies. This will also benefit the Iranian people, who are the\\nchief victims of the Revolutionary Guard.\\nThe new sanctions also will ratchet up pressure on\\nforeign firms that continue to do business with Iran. Such firms could now face\\nprosecution in U.S. courts for providing material support for terrorism if they\\nengage in commerce with Iranian entities affiliated with the Revolutionary Guard.\\nPresident Donald Trump hammered this point home in a White\\nHouse statement Monday when he warned: “If\\nyou are doing business with the [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps], you will\\nbe bankrolling terrorism.” \\nHe also made it clear that more Iran sanctions are\\ncoming: \\nThis action sends a clear message to Tehran that its support for terrorism has serious consequences. We will continue to increase financial pressure and raise the costs on the Iranian regime for its support of terrorist activity until it abandons its malign and outlaw behavior.\\nThis added pressure on Iran’s economy is sure to put greater\\nstress on the Iranian regime, which already faces growing discontent from Iranians.\\nThe Trump administration hopes that stronger sanctions will compel Tehran to\\nmoderate its hostile policies or risk being overthrown by its own people.',\n",
       " 'President Donald Trump pulled the plug on the Iran nuclear deal Tuesday, taking it off life support after months of warning that the flawed 2015 agreement needed to be ended or mended.\\nWhen it became clear that France, Germany, and the United Kingdom—three other signatories to the nuclear deal—could not reach an acceptable agreement with Washington on how to correct flaws in the deal, the president announced that the U.S. would withdraw from the agreement and re-impose sanctions:\\nWe will be instituting the highest level of economic sanction. Any nation that helps Iran in its quest for nuclear weapons could also be strongly sanctioned by the United States. America will not be held hostage to nuclear blackmail.\\nIn his speech, the president noted that at the heart of the nuclear agreement “was a giant fiction that a murderous regime desired only a peaceful nuclear energy program.”\\nHe said:\\nThe Iran deal is defective at its core. If we do nothing, we know exactly what will happen. In just a short period of time, the world’s leading state sponsor of terror will be on the cusp of acquiring the world’s most dangerous weapons.\\nTrump also warned, “If the regime continues its nuclear aspirations, it will have bigger problems than it has ever had before.”\\nBut he was careful to distinguish between the regime and “the longsuffering people of Iran,” whom he assured: “The people of America stand with you.”\\nThis implicit call for regime change was balanced with a willingness to negotiate a new deal with Iran. He acknowledged that Iran’s leaders had ruled out new nuclear negotiations, but ended on a hopeful note: “ … [T]hey are going to want to make a new and lasting deal, one that benefits all of Iran and the Iranian people. When they do, I am ready, willing, and able.”\\nThis was precisely the right message to send.

       " 'Since the election of President Donald Trump, the European Union and the United States have increasingly disagreed on Iran policy. The divergence widened in May with Trump’s announcement that the United States was withdrawing from the Iran nuclear agreement.\\nWashington has since reimposed\\xa0nuclear sanctions\\xa0on Iran in two rounds in August and November. Meanwhile, the EU has sought to preserve the nuclear agreement by trying to protect Iran from renewed sanctions.\\nThe EU’s campaign to shield Iran from U.S. sanctions is doomed to fail.\\nThe biggest European companies already have voted with their wallets and pulled out of Iran. They have a lot more to lose if they are cut off from the U.S. market by secondary sanctions than they have to gain from trade with Iran’s much smaller market.\\nMarket forces are too strong for such companies to ignore their economic interests in maintaining access to the U.S. market to oblige EU bureaucrats more worried about alleged U.S. “economic imperialism” than they are about the terrorism, subversion, and ballistic missiles exported by Iran.\\nThe danger is that smaller European companies, with little or no stake in trade with the United States, could risk sanctions and continue trading or investing in Iran. This would dilute the impact and undermine the effectiveness of U.S. sanctions.\\nEuropean allies played a major role in ratcheting up sanctions pressure on Iran in 2012-13, and they remain a key channel for restoring sanctions pressure now. The EU is Iran’s second-largest trading partner, after China, and a leading consumer of Iran’s oil exports.\\nKicking the Tires on the Special Purpose Vehicle\\nAs part of a package of economic incentives designed to induce Iran to remain in the nuclear agreement, the foreign ministers of the EU, Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and China met on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in September to hash out the creation of a “Special Purpose Vehicle”—a new mechanism to facilitate trade between Iran and other states and avoid U.S. sanctions.\\nThe details of the SPV are still being worked out. It would be a clearinghouse that uses some form of a barter system to enable Iran to continue trading its oil for European goods and other goods. Iranian firms could use the SPV to accumulate credits for their exports that could be used to pay for imports from other foreign companies participating in the SPV.\\nEssentially, the SPV would function like an\\xa0escrow agent, periodically settling the balance between exports and imports. It would use euros or sterling, rather than U.S. dollars, to minimize the exposure of participating companies to U.S. sanctions.\\nThe Trump administration has strongly denounced the EU’s SPV strategy. Additionally, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\\xa0blasted\\xa0the scheme, calling it “one of the most counterproductive measures imaginable for regional and global peace and security.”\\nNational security adviser John Bolton\\xa0warned\\xa0that the United States does “not intend to allow our sanctions to be evaded by Europe or anybody else.”\\nWashington could take action against SPV-enabled trade by applying sanctions against the banks that transfer money into and out of the SPV, as well as officials who create or operate within the SPV.\\nAlthough Washington would not have the same visibility into SPV transactions as in SWIFT transactions, it also could target firms that participate in SPV trade. This will deter most firms from participating, except for small companies heavily dependent on Iran for income.\\nSymbolism Over Security\\nBy colluding with Russia and China to evade U.S. sanctions, the EU seeks to appease Iran, keep it in the flawed 2015\\xa0nuclear deal\\xa0, and deliver a symbolic diplomatic slap to the Trump administration.\\nBut the SPV and other measures such as EU’s updated\\xa0Blocking Statute\\xa0are not likely to meet Iran’s demands for remaining in the nuclear agreement. These measures may marginally reduce the impact of U.S. sanctions on trade, but they will not satisfy Tehran’s need for substantial foreign investment and technology transfer.\\nIran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Kazem Sajjadpour\\xa0signaled\\xa0Tehran’s frustration with the limited progress made on EU efforts to bypass U.S. sanctions: “What is lacking is both speed and efficiency.”\\nIran’s distrust of EU bureaucrats is shared by many European businessmen, who are unwilling to risk being targeted by U.S. sanctions that would impose concrete economic penalties in order to enable EU officials to take a symbolic stand against Washington.\\nTo make matters worse, the SPV will be open to non-European firms, meaning that the EU will be enabling Russia and China to advance their own economic and geopolitical interests regarding Iran.\\nThe EU’s misguided efforts to appease Iran not only facilitate Iran’s hegemonic ambitions, but they also could jeopardize the security of EU citizens.\\nTehran recently was caught red-handed in foiled plots to bomb an Iranian exile rally in\\xa0France\\xa0in June 2018 and an effort to assassinate the exiled leaders of a separatist Arab Iranian opposition group in\\xa0Denmark\\xa0in October.\\nSuch activity is nothing new. The Tehran regime has orchestrated a\\xa0long list\\xa0of terrorist attacks and political assassinations in Europe.\\nYet the EU’s craven efforts to propitiate Iran are likely to increase the risks of future attacks by Iran or its surrogates, including\\xa0Hezbollah.\\nThe\\xa0bottom line\\xa0is that the EU can undermine the impact of U.S. sanctions, but cannot fully protect Iran from the consequences of its hostile policies.\\nMeanwhile, the EU is gambling with the security of its own citizens as well as the security of its Middle East allies threatened by Iran in a dangerous effort to appease Tehran.\\nThis story was originally publish in The National Interest',\n",

Putin has used the Russian Orthodox Church to stir up minorities and attack anti-corruption efforts like Ukraine health care reforms.\\nThe FSB (Russian intelligence) uses social media platforms to incite extremism. Russian intelligence even recruited a French citizen to attempt to smuggle weapons out of Crimea and organize terrorist attacks in France. This action could then be blamed on support from “fascists” in Ukraine.\\nLearning how to counter these terrible “hybrid warfare” tactics and defanging Putin’s capacity to destabilize the West is a priority for NATO.\\nThe current situation in Ukraine warrants further exploration into how sovereign nations can counter hybrid warfare tactics.\\nEstablishing a NATO-certified center of excellence\\xa0on hybrid warfare in Ukraine would be a step in the right direction.\\nCenters of Excellence\\xa0are international organizations certified by NATO that train individuals in particular security matters from both NATO member and partner countries.\\nNATO has 24 certified Centers of Excellence that work on a range of issues from cold weather operations in Bodø, Norway, to defense against terrorism in Ankara, Turkey.\\nSeveral of the existing Centers of Excellence study specific components of hybrid warfare like cybersecurity and energy security. However, no single center studies hybrid warfare and how best to counteract it in its entirety.\\nThe United States and NATO can learn a lot from Ukraine.

This year, the campaign hopes to highlight global gender inequalities and advocate change under the slogan “Press for Progress.”\\nWomen across the globe face unique challenges to obtaining the same rights and privileges as their male counterparts. Recent protests over compulsory hijab laws in Iran remind us all why International Women’s Day is important.\\nIn December 2017, protests broke out across Iran over the negligence of government officials and the failing Iranian economy. However, the protests quickly gave way to a public outcry over gender discrimination laws. One woman in particular caught international attention when she stood on a street corner waving her hijab over her head.\\nWhether a woman wants to wear a hijab should be her personal decision. However, Iranian religious law has dictated female dress code in public since the Iranian Revolution in 1979.\\nUnder this law, all women and girls over the age of 9 are required to wear a hijab in public. For any woman to remove her hijab in the public square is a crime and puts her at risk of incarceration in some of Iran’s most notorious prisons.\\nHowever, rather than be intimidated, this woman set off a wave of hijab protests.\\nNow, women across Iran are risking their lives to protest compulsory hijab laws. Within the last week, police pulled a hijab-less woman from a telephone cable box, causing her injuries. Videos of the incident made their rounds on social media and incited further protests.\\nAmnesty International reports that dozens of Iranian women are currently at risk of long jail terms for protesting compulsory hijabs. At least 35 have been arrested in Tehran alone, with several reportedly subjected to torture while in prison.\\nIn an official statement, the Iranian police warned women that if they continue removing their hijabs in protest, they would be charged with inciting corruption and prostitution—a crime that carries a hefty jail sentence.\\nCompulsory hijab laws are not the only challenge that Iranian women face. Just last month, the Iranian state television ran a program calling for victims of domestic abuse to “kiss their husband’s feet.” A ban on women in sports stadiums led to at least 35 women being arrested for attempting to attend a soccer match.\\nA woman cannot get married without the consent of her male guardian. Married women cannot leave the country without their husband’s permission. Even Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has described the idea of gender equality as unacceptable for society.\\nDespite the dire human rights situation and potential backlash from governmental authorities, the women of Iran are demanding change. The Iranian government released a report stating that the majority of Iranians disagree with compulsory hijab laws.\\nMore women are protesting despite more arrests being made. Iranians have even taken to social media to protest compulsory hijab laws and the bans on women attending sporting events.\\nOn this International Women’s Day, the world will reflect on the progress women have made and the challenges they still face. As we celebrate this day, do not forget the women of Iran and the sacrifice they are making to fight for women’s rights.',\n",

(Photo: Maciej Moskwa/ZUMA Press/Newscom)\\n\\nMadyson Hutchinson Posey\\n/\\n@madyhutch\\n\\nMadyson Hutchinson Posey is a research and administrative assistant at the Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy at The Heritage Foundation.\\nYears of internal conflicts and poor governance are not the only problems facing the African countries of South Sudan, Nigeria, and Somalia.\\nThe United Nations recently declared famine in parts of South Sudan and Nigeria. Judging by current conditions, it won’t be long before Somalia follows suit.\\nThe number of people affected is staggering. In South Sudan, 100,000 people are on the verge of starvation with another 5 million at risk. That number of at-risk people totals 6.2 million in Somalia—half of its population—and 4.4 million in Nigeria.\\nAcross all three countries, roughly 1.4 million children are at imminent risk of death. Those numbers are unlikely to decrease anytime soon and could even increase in the coming weeks.\\nThis is not the first time these three nations have faced famine and starvation. The semi-arid climates in parts of their countries make them prone to drought.\\nBut this current famine was brought on by more than below-average rainfall. Humanitarian aid organizations and the U.S. State Department have called the famine in South Sudan “man-made.”\\nIt is not difficult to understand why. Weather conditions may cause drought, but poor governance and instability quickly turn a drought into a humanitarian crisis.\\nTake South Sudan as an example.\\nAfter 25 years of war, the country gained independence from Sudan in 2011. Only 18 months later, tensions within the government plunged the South Sudanese nation into a crippling civil war that cut off South Sudan’s trade routes with neighboring countries, prevented farmers from growing and harvesting food, and caused remaining food prices to skyrocket.\\nA famine was narrowly averted in 2014 thanks only to a massive international humanitarian effort. However, famine looms again. Various countries have pledged help for this latest hunger crisis, but this relief may never reach the people who need it most.\\nDespite the South Sudanese government promising “unimpeded access” for aid workers in the country, the South Sudanese security services and aligned forces frequently block the delivery of humanitarian relief.\\nThe government has delayed agencies’ paperwork that would allow them to distribute aid. Soldiers have instituted military checkpoints around famine stricken areas and are preventing relief workers from crossing them.\\nThe government is blocking aid for a number of likely reasons. It has for years stirred up anti-Western and anti-U.N. sentiment over the international community’s pressure on the government to halt its campaign of war crimes and ethnic killings. It may be blocking humanitarian aid in an attempt to retaliate.\\nThe government is also likely blocking aid to rebel-controlled or influenced areas to punish those communities for what the government believes is their support for the rebels.\\nPoor governance and internal conflict have similarly contributed to the hunger crises in Somalia and Nigeria. Internal conflict has wreaked havoc in Somalia for nearly three decades, and the internationally-backed government has been mired in corruption and bickering.\\nFurthermore, the government has been unable to extend its authority to much of the country.\\nNigeria’s government is relatively stable, but for years it has mismanaged the fight against the ISIS-aligned Boko Haram terrorist group that at one point controlled much of northeast Nigeria. Now, that same northeast region—torn by violence and terrorism—faces the worst of this famine crisis.\\nAs the current humanitarian crisis grows, the international community will continue to offer emergency relief, and it should. But without better governance and stability in these countries, there is only so much these efforts will achieve.\\nNote: This article has been updated to correct the location of Nigeria that Boko Haram once largely controlled.',\n",
       " 'While violent civil conflicts have prevailed elsewhere in the Middle East since the Arab Spring of 2011, Tunisia has pursued a transition to democracy without bloodshed.\\nIn 2014, the country made massive strides, adopting a new constitution, and then holding its first full parliamentary and presidential elections under that constitution.\\nAs with any young democracy, Tunisia’s government continues to face daunting tasks. At the top of the government’s to-do list are revitalizing the economy and building the public’s confidence in a fledgling democracy.\\nThat’s a tall order, and government leaders will need to continue working with Tunisia’s robust and vibrant civil society and youth population to make it work.\\nJob opportunities and training for the young are especially crucial, as they represent a huge slice of the population. They also, as the truism goes, represent Tunisia’s future.\\nTo solidify their support for democracy, it is vital that the younger generation experiences, early on, the benefits of a free economy. Failure to meet expectations could result in disillusionment with democracy itself and bring the risk of instability.\\nOn the broader economic front, structural reforms must be carried out more decisively to show that democracy can bring measureable prosperity for the ordinary Tunisian.\\nTunisia has relied on international loans to jumpstart its economy in the face of increasing oil prices and decreasing tourism. However, failure to improve current economic conditions has less to do with financial support from international partners and more with Tunisia’s own shortcomings, particularly in following through on critical reform measures. Sweeping and more decisive regulatory reforms are needed to ensure economic growth and open opportunities to all Tunisians.\\nFor the United States, Tunisia’s embrace of democracy makes the country a critical asset of untapped potential value. A steady and democratic Tunisia not only provides the U.S. with a strategic ally but also serves as a model for future democracies in the region.\\nSince the January 2011 revolution, the U.S. has committed more than $1.4 billion in aid to support Tunisia’s transition to democracy. U.S. assistance to Tunisia focuses on an array of targeted areas that include ensuring and enhancing internal and external security, promoting democratic practices and good governance, and supporting sustainable economic growth.\\nThe success of Tunisia’s bottom-up pursuit of democracy and economic freedom will be a success for the United States, too. In a 2015 joint commentary, Kim R. Holmes of The Heritage Foundation and William B. Taylor of the Institute of Peace made the compelling case that Tunisia is a strategic partner in a region where stable, democratic allies are rare and critically needed.\\nThat still rings true today.

(Photo: iStock Photos)\\n\\nMadyson Hutchinson Posey\\n/\\n@madyhutch\\n\\nMadyson Hutchinson Posey is a research and administrative assistant at the Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy at The Heritage Foundation.\\nMany Arab countries have legal provisions that allow men accused or convicted of rape to avoid punishment.\\nOften called “marry your rapist” laws, these provisions generally state that a rapist will not be prosecuted if he marries his victim. Proponents believe that these laws protect women from stigmas surrounding rape.\\nHowever, most people—including some Arab leaders—view them as a major human rights violation.\\nThe specific “marry your rapist” provisions are generally found in cultures where a woman’s chastity is tied to the honor of her family. They are not isolated to the Muslim world, although some interpretations of Islamic law and social attitudes make them more common there.\\nIn most of these countries, rape is significantly underreported and often considered to be the victim’s fault as much as the perpetrator’s. Individual countries’ criminal codes often reinforce this belief.\\nSome countries have provisions that require a woman to prove she was raped by having multiple male witnesses. Even more egregious, a woman can actually face charges for illicit sex even if it was proven that the act took place against her will.\\nIn other countries, someone who rapes a child can avoid punishment by marrying the victim.\\nDespite these antiquated attitudes, Arab countries are increasingly re-examining their criminal codes, repealing the “marry your rapist” laws, and in some cases instituting harsher penalties for perpetrators.\\nThis is largely due to internal social pressure. For example, Bahrain is currently considering removing its “rape clause” and introducing stricter punishments against rapists.\\nEgypt, Morocco, and Tunisia have all repealed their versions of the law. Jordan and Lebanon are now the latest Arab countries to follow this growing trend.\\nJordan, a pro-Western but socially conservative kingdom, debated the repeal of its marriage rape law—Article 308—for four years.\\nWafa Bani Mustafa, a female member of Parliament, first proposed the abolition of Article 308 in December 2013. Her proposal ignited a campaign in the private sector that reached every district in the country.\\nWell-known academics, journalists, and activists all took part in the effort to repeal Article 308. Their work came to fruition when Jordan finally abolished the law in August.\\nThe Lebanese Parliamentary Committee for Administration and Justice announced in December 2016 that Lebanon would move to abolish its version of the “marry your rapist” law, Article 522. Prime Minister Saad Hariri also expressed his support of repeal.\\nNot long after the announcement, Abaad MENA, a Lebanese nongovernmental organization, launched its\\xa0official campaign, “A White Dress Doesn’t Cover the Rape.” Abaad MENA sought to raise awareness about the physical and psychological trauma that victims experience when they are forced to marry their rapist.\\nThe Parliamentary Committee for Administration and Justice approved a proposed repeal of Article 522 in February. On Aug. 16, Lebanon officially abolished the law.\\nWhile there is still progress to be made regarding women’s legal protections, Jordan and Lebanon have taken a significant step forward in repealing and reforming their rape laws.\\nAs public opinion evolves, more countries will be pressured to re-examine their criminal codes. Many, including Mustafa, remain hopeful. She believes that civil society will continue to play a key role in pressuring governments to change the law.\\nWhile social attitudes may evolve more slowly, legal change is a good first step.',\n",

Critics have stated concerns that the deal did not do enough to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, something that threatens the security of the entire international community.\\nAs Trump outlined in his strategy, Iran’s offences are not limited to its nuclear program. This is why he included countering Iranian aggression as one component of his four-point strategy.\\nIran’s growing influence is a threat to regional stability and is harming U.S. allies. Since sanctions on Iran were lifted in 2016, Iran has enjoyed increased financial and economic influence, which it has since invested in destabilizing many of its neighbors.\\nIn addition to having a nuclear program, here are four ways that Iran is increasingly destabilizing the Middle East.\\n1. Proxy wars and undermining of U.S. partners.\\nIran has a long history of backing rebel groups and undermining established regional governments.\\nIn Yemen, Iran is seeking to weaken Saudi Arabia’s influence by supporting the Houthi rebels against Saudi and Yemeni forces and against a Saudi-led Arab expeditionary force. The Houthis have carried out attacks on U.S. and U.S.-allied ships in the Red Sea with Iranian-supplied weapons.\\nIran even threatened to take military action against Saudi Arabia.\\n2. Smuggling of weapons and soldiers.\\nIran was able to capitalize on Iraq’s fight against ISIS and the instability that resulted. In particular, it has created transportation and logistical infrastructure to move soldiers and weapons through Iraq to its proxy forces in Syria and Lebanon.\\nIran is doing the same in Yemen. One U.S. officer noted that Iran has provided Houthi fighters with a deadly arsenal of weaponry that has even been used to attack U.S.-allied ships in the Red Sea.\\nIran has also recruited thousands of Afghan refugees and deployed them as armed volunteer forces to fight alongside President Bashar al-Assad’s troops in Syria.\\n3. Aligning with brutal regimes. \\nThe Syrian civil war has been bloody and brutal. Over half a million Syrians have been killed, and millions more are now displaced. Iran’s support for Assad is one of the key elements safeguarding his government’s survival.\\nIran has dispatched senior military figures, deployed hundreds of Revolutionary Guard soldiers, and provided monetary, intelligence, training, communications, and weapons support to Assad, despite his gross human rights violations.\\nIran’s allies include hostile nations like Russia, which has fought alongside Iranian forces and Assad in Syria, as well as Venezuela, which is falling apart under a corrupt, anti-Western government.\\nIran’s support of the Palestinian Authority has encouraged a rise in Palestinian terrorism and confidence in one day replacing Israel with a unitary Palestinian state.\\n4. State-sponsored terrorism.\\nOne of Iran’s most notorious evils is its funding of terrorism. The State Department lists Iran as the No. 1 state sponsor of terrorism, and for good reason.\\nFor years, Iran has backed anti-Western groups like Hamas and Hezbollah, as well as proxy groups in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen that have worsened ongoing regional conflicts.\\nIn the Gaza Strip, Hamas regularly carries out attacks on Israel by using Iranian-funded weaponry, and having benefitted from Iranian-funded training.\\nIn Lebanon, Hezbollah broadcasts pro-Iranian news and carries out attacks on the Lebanese-Israeli border. Iranian-backed Hezbollah fighters in Syria have played a role in propping up the Assad regime.\\nIran has also been accused of supporting the Taliban in Afghanistan—a relationship the country formalized in early 2014—and of refusing to punish senior al-Qaeda members.\\nPreventing the Iranian regime from obtaining nuclear capabilities is important, but that is not the only threat Iran poses to the region.\\nIranian influence is expanding, and instead of slowing or preventing this expanding influence, provisions under the Iran nuclear deal have made it easier for Iran to negatively influence and destabilize the Middle East.\\nTrump’s refusal to recertify the deal could mark a turning point in Iran’s destructive influence.',\n",

A civil war has left Yemen in what some are calling the world’s “largest humanitarian crisis to date.”\\nAfter the Arab Spring protests forced former President Ali Abdullah Saleh out of power in 2012, he joined with rebels supported by Iran to overthrow his successor, current President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi.\\nHadi, forced into exile in Saudi Arabia, made a comeback after a Saudi-led coalition intervened to support his government in 2015.\\nAlthough there are many actors involved, three major factions are now battling for control of Yemen: the current Hadi government (supported by an Arab coalition led by Saudi Arabia), the Houthi and Saleh-aligned rebels (largely backed by Iran), and al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (a terrorist group).\\nAs the Hadi government and Houthi rebels struggle for control, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has capitalized on the instability and increased its presence and terror attacks. Other terrorist groups are also flourishing in Yemen’s chaos, including some who have pledged loyalty to the Islamic State.\\nIn the midst of this brutal civil war and increased terrorism, Yemen’s civilians have withstood the worst of the conflict.\\nHere is a glimpse of just how devastating this war has been.\\nTo put this situation into further perspective, consider that Yemen has a population of 27 million people. Approximately 18.8 million—69 percent\\xa0of the country’s population—is in need of immediate humanitarian assistance.\\nInstability, security threats, and a lack of basic infrastructure have prevented aid organizations from helping.\\nThe United States has an interest in not only helping to mitigate this humanitarian crisis but also to encourage a political settlement to end the war. What happens in Yemen could negatively affect regional stability and be disastrous for U.S. interests.\\nThe fighting between the Houthi rebels and Hadi government is symbolic of a much larger struggle between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Iran sees this war as an opportunity to undermine Saudi influence in the Arab world and increase its own.\\nIt is vital to U.S. interests that Iran’s influence be contained.\\nYemen’s geo-strategic importance cannot be ignored either. The country borders two U.S. allies and sits at the convergence point of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, overlooking the Bab el Mandab Strait—a key trade route, particularly for oil.\\nA daily 4.7 million barrels of oil are transported through that strait. At its most narrow point, the Bab el Mandab is only 18 miles wide, meaning that ships must pass closely together, usually only two at a time.\\nSerious disruptions of this route could constrict the flow of Persian Gulf oil to Europe and the western hemisphere and raise world oil prices.\\nRecent reports about Houthi rebel attacks against U.S. and other ships off Yemen’s coast have raised concerns about maritime security in the Red Sea.\\nAs the war continues and Iranian influence grows, Tehran may seek to expand its leverage by escalating the potential threat to ships passing through the waterways.\\nThe war has been devastating for Yemen’s civilians and regional stability. The U.S. can encourage a political settlement, but it will be up to the Yemenis and larger Arab world to see it into fruition.\\nAny settlement will also be impossible until Iran stops stoking the fire with its support for the Houthis.\\nHowever, without a solution to end the fighting, Yemen’s humanitarian crisis will only get worse.',\n",

(Photo: Balkis Press/Sipa USA/Newscom)\\n\\nMadyson Hutchinson Posey\\n/\\n@madyhutch\\n\\nMadyson Hutchinson Posey is a research and administrative assistant at the Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy at The Heritage Foundation.\\nThe Iraq-Saudi Arabia relationship, while historically rocky, appears to be on the mend.\\nSaddam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990 prompted Saudi Arabia to close its border with Iraq. Since then, only Iraqi religious pilgrims have been allowed to cross once a year during the hajj season.\\nAfter 27 years, the two nations are now planning to reopen the border crossing for trade. This decision came shortly after the Saudi Cabinet’s announcement that it had established a joint trade commission with Iraq.\\nThe Iraq-Saudi Arabia relationship has been marginally influenced by Iran’s shifting political situation. Prior to 1979, the Saudis were wary of Hussein and suspected him of supporting movements that were hostile to Saudi interests.\\nThe Iranian Islamic Revolution of 1979 dramatically changed that relationship. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini’s rise to power and the Iranian decree of Islamic revolution incited fear among both the Iraqis and the Saudis pushing them into greater cooperation.\\nThis cooperation continued during the Iran-Iraq War, when, though technically neutral, Saudi Arabia provided Iraq with financial assistance and energy security, even permitting the Iraqis to build a pipeline across Saudi Arabia to avoid Iranian attacks on ships carrying its oil exports.\\nHowever, the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait harmed Iraqi-Saudi relations. There was concern that Hussein’s armies would cross into Saudi Arabia’s northern border, which they eventually did before being repulsed.\\nThe Saudis shut down their Baghdad embassy, cut diplomatic ties, and closed the border with Iraq. Saudi Arabia went on to oppose the United States’ invasion of Iraq in 2003 over concerns that it would benefit Iran and pose a future threat to regional stability and security.\\nIran’s relationship with Iraq was particularly hostile until the removal of Hussein from power. Hussein’s regime was dominated by a secular Sunni minority running a predominantly Shiite country. In the eyes of revolutionary Iran, this was unacceptable.\\nConsequently, Iraq acted as a balancing power in the region for years up until Hussein’s ouster.\\nWhen the U.S. ousted Hussein after its invasion in 2003, leading to its replacement by a Shia-dominated government, Iran saw an opportunity to dominate its neighbor in such a way that Iraq would no longer be a military threat.\\nToday, growing Iranian influence is increasingly threatening regional stability in the Middle East. The current chaos and the rise of the Islamic State have created conditions allowing Iran to gain a significant foothold in the country.\\nIran has created transportation and logistical infrastructure to move soldiers and weapons through Iraq to proxy forces in Syria and Lebanon. It has provided training and munitions to Iraqi militias and assisted in attacking U.S. troops.\\nIran is backing the anti-Saudi, Houthi rebels in Yemen and has recently threatened military action against Saudi Arabia.\\nAn Iran-friendly Iraq is bad news for Saudi Arabia.\\nReligious divisions between Shiite and Sunni populations are a predominant source of tensions in the Middle East. Iraq and Iran are both largely Shiite nations, while Saudi Arabia is Sunni with a Shia minority.\\nAn Iraq-Iran alliance could further destabilize the region and pose a direct threat to the Saudis.\\nSaudi Arabia is attempting to counter Iranian influence by investing in its northern neighbor. Saudi Arabia appointed a nonresident ambassador to Iraq in 2012, and in 2016 reopened its Baghdad embassy. The Saudi ambassador to Iraq noted that the reopening would allow the countries to cooperate on anti-extremism efforts.\\nAdditionally, the crown prince has agreed to examine other potential investments in the southern regions of Iraq.\\nNow, Saudi Arabia is reopening its 506-mile border with Iraq. This action signifies Saudi Arabia’s commitment to preventing an Iranian hegemon in the region, and it marks an effort to improve ties between Saudi Arabia’s Sunni government and its Shiite-dominated neighbor to the north.\\nIn a surprising event, the influential Shiite, Iraqi cleric Muqtada al-Sadr travelled to Riyadh to meet with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The meeting resulted in Saudi Arabia agreeing to donate $10 million in aid to the Iraqi government.\\nSadr has long commanded a large following of Iraq’s poorer populations and has been an anti-American, Iranian ally for most of the post-Hussein era. But his recent outreach to the Saudis could signal a positive breakthrough in not only Saudi-Iraq relations but Arab Sunni-Shiite relations as well.\\nThe time is ripe for Saudi Arabia to build positive diplomatic relationships with Iraqi leaders and politicians. As the Islamic State loses power, Iraq will be looking to restore stability to its people.\\nSaudi Arabia will play an important role in both strengthening Iraq and maintaining greater regional stability if both sides allow this relationship to progress.',\n",
       " 'Under the misleading guise of being a British company, a firm connected to a Russian oligarch is seeking to expand its investments and business dealings across the United States.\\xa0 \\nOnly\\na few months after Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska’s companies were\\nscandalously removed from U.S. sanctions, they have wasted no time trying to\\nenter the U.S. market. \\nNo matter how enticing the foreign investment might be for some states, they should be extremely cautious when dealing with Russian companies—especially those connected to the Kremlin. \\xa0\\nAnything\\nlinked to Deripaska should be a concern, as he is steeped in controversy.\\xa0\\xa0 \\nA billionaire several times over, he enjoys close connections inside the Kremlin. While his companies were removed from sanctions, he personally remains listed. He has a long history of confrontation with American authorities. In the past decade, he was denied a\\xa0business visa\\xa0to the United States and was named a person of interest in the federal investigation into Russian meddling in U.S. elections. \\nDespite all that, in January, the Office of Foreign Assets Control decided to lift sanctions on two of his companies, aluminum giant Rusal and its parent company, En+ Group. \\nThere was bipartisan shock within the U.S. foreign policy establishment. Several Republican senators, including Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Cory Gardner of Colorado, Marco Rubio of Florida, and Susan Collins of Maine expressed their displeasure with the decision. \\nSince\\nthe sanctions were lifted, Deripaska’s lackeys have wasted no time in seeking\\nto expand business into the U.S.\\nIt’s\\nbeen reported that Rusal will\\ninvest in a $1.7 billion aluminum mill in Kentucky. It would have been\\nunthinkable that during the Cold War a Soviet aluminum company would have been\\nallowed to invest in the U.S. So how has that been able to happen today? \\nThere\\nare two main reasons.\\nFirst, it was a team of lawyers and lobbyists employed by Rusal and En+ Group that successfully persuaded the Office of Foreign Assets Control that Deripaska had relinquished control over those companies so they could be delisted. \\nHeather\\nConley, who served in President George W. Bush’s administration dealing with\\nEuropean issues, perhaps described the situation the\\nbest. \\n“They\\nuse our laws, our rules, our banks, our lawyers, our lobbyists—it’s a strategy\\nfrom within,” she said.\\nAnd it was successful. At the time the sanctions were lifted, Cotton remarked: “I don’t believe Deripaska will be denied operational control of these companies, and I therefore believe they should remain subject to sanctions.”\\nSecond, Deripaska has been able to create an image of his Russian companies actually being respectable British entities. He hired former British minister and ex-Tory parliamentarian Greg Barker to serve as the chairman of En+ Group. \\nBefore entering politics, Barker had a questionable history going back to the 1990s, working for Russian oligarchs, including Roman Abramovich. \\nWhen En+ Group was listed, amid controversy, on the London Stock Exchange in November 2017, Barker’s name gave a patina of respectability to investors. \\nLast April, Barker sent\\nletters to eight state governors making the case as to how\\ntheir states could benefit from Rusal’s investment. But nowhere does the letter\\neven say that Rusal is Russian. \\nRussia continues to prop up Syrian strongman Bashar Assad\\nand occupy huge chunks of Ukraine and Georgia. It has meddled in U.S. elections\\nand surely plans to do so again in the future. \\nThe idea that a major Russian aluminum company should be\\nallowed to invest in America’s heartland is very concerning. \\nLast year, London’s\\xa0Daily Telegraph\\xa0reported that at least three suspected former Russian spies occupy key positions in Deripaska’s businesses, including En+ Group. Barker’s letters to state governors and Deripaska’s legal gymnastics that resulted in his companies getting delisted from U.S. sanctions should be major eye-openers for U.S. policymakers. \\nAt the end of the day, as massive Russian companies with global interests, Rusal’s and En+ Group’s investments in the United States should come under intense scrutiny. After all, in the case of Rusal, the aluminum it produces has helped build the Russian war machine we are seeing in action in places like Ukraine and Syria. \\nU.S. governors need to enter into any deal with companies\\nlike Rusal with their eyes wide open, knowing who they are really dealing with—not\\nsome British lord, but a Russian oligarch intimately linked to Russian\\nPresident Vladimir Putin himself.

       " 'No matter what President Donald Trump does, the Iran deal is likely dead on May 12.\\nThat’s the deadline by which the president must decide whether he will keep the U.S. in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or Iran deal—a deal that seems more likely to give Iranians a patient path to nuclear weapons than secure any kind of peace long term.\\nBack in January, Trump said he will seek to secure a better deal with our European allies but that: “This is a last chance. In the absence of such an agreement, the United States will not again waive sanctions in order to stay in the Iran nuclear deal. And if at any time I judge that such an agreement is not within reach, I will withdraw from the deal immediately. No one should doubt my word.”\\nThis statement leaves two choices: either the Europeans fail to come to some sort of agreement with the Trump administration to fix the flaws in the deal, resulting in the U.S. leaving the deal, or the Europeans agree to fix some of the flaws and then the Iranians leave.\\nEurope and the Iran Deal\\nPublicly, it seems that the rounds of talks with our European allies have not made much progress.\\nIt does not seem there is an agreement with Europeans to fix the “original sin” of the Iran deal—the so called sunset clauses that allow key restrictions on items like uranium enrichment, centrifuge production, and international monitoring to expire after a certain number of years.\\nAgreement on addressing some of the other contentious aspects of the deal, namely the inability to curb Iran’s ballistic missile program, and the unconditional opening up of all its military facilities to international inspectors, seem remote.\\nIf the president decides to leave the deal, it’s hardly the end of the world—or even bad. instead, it should be seen as a necessary step to confront one of the deadliest threats Americans, Israelis, and Gulf Arabs face. America’s European allies better be prepared for this.\\nUltimately, the Iran deal is a fundamentally flawed agreement that gave Tehran massive sanctions relief up front—while only requiring it to make temporary and easily reversible concessions on its nuclear program.\\nAlready, the Iran Deal Has Proved Ineffective\\nThe deal has failed to live up to the original goal of the international community when talks with Tehran started: to stop Iran from ever getting nuclear weapons. Instead, at best, the current deal only delays it by 10-15 years.\\nAnd this is only the case assuming that Iran remains not cheating on the deal behind the scenes—something the international inspectors cannot unequivocally prove under the flawed terms of the deal. Yet nothing since 1979, when the ayatollahs took power during the Islamic revolution, has shown that Iran can be a trusted partner.\\nKey restrictions on Tehran’s nuclear activities expire after 10 years. Under the deal, Iran is given a green light to operate its covertly built, formerly illicit nuclear facilities and gradually expand its uranium enrichment program to an industrial scale. This legitimized Iran’s past nuclear cheating and paved the way for a patient path to nuclear weapons.\\nIt is difficult to argue that the nuclear deal effectively advances U.S. goals when Iran publicly refuses to allow inspections of its military bases in violation of the terms of the deal, develops ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear warheads, and eagerly anticipates the expiration of key restrictions on its uranium enrichment activities.\\nContrary to the promises of the Obama administration, the nuclear deal has not moderated Iran’s foreign policy. In fact, since the nuclear deal was sealed in 2015, Tehran has cashed in on the sanctions relief, invested heavily in terrorist proxies, and stepped up its hostile activities in the region. Today we see the evidence of this in Yemen, Syria, and Iraq.\\nMany Iranians Also Dislike the Deal\\nPerhaps it is a twist of geopolitical irony that, like many Americans, many Iranians are unhappy with the deal, too. The economic windfall, which many were hoping for, has not trickled down to the average person, a frustration evident during the December/January protests that rocked the country.\\nInstead of going to average Iranians, the billions of dollars of unfrozen assets and sanctions relief have been used to fund Iran’s military adventures around the region. The international banking sector is still put off by the poor investment environment in Iran.\\nThe truth is the only country that can save the deal is Iran. With fragmented leadership, a tanking economy, and deep unpopularity, maybe Tehran will decide that it is in its own self-interest to pull back on its destabilizing foreign policy and threats to renew nuclear programs and save itself from itself.\\nIn the year 570 AD, the year that the Prophet Muhammad was born, the Sassanian empire, the predecessor of modern-day Iran, had its first foray into Yemen. Today, almost 1,500 years later, Iran is meddling in Yemen again. It is through the lens of this long history that Iran sees its future—and this is something the West fails to understand.\\nThis is why the sunset clauses in the Iran nuclear agreement are so dangerous. This “original sin” of the agreement is based on the hope that Iran’s behavior will change between now and when certain prohibitions expire—but this is an assumption that has no basis in recent history or reality. A breakout period of 15-20 years to achieve a nuclear weapon is merely a blink of an eye for Iran’s leaders.\\nTrump needs to ask himself one very simple question on May 12: Does the Iran deal stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons forever?\\nIf the answer is no, then he must walk away.',\n",
       " 'Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2014 with the use of so-called “little green men” and Moscow’s subsequent meddling in elections across the transatlantic community, “hybrid warfare” has become the term du jour in Western foreign policy circles. \\nPerhaps the best definition of hybrid warfare is offered by the new European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats, which describes it as “coordinated and synchronized action that deliberately targets democratic states’ and institutions’ systemic vulnerabilities, through a wide range of means (political, economic, military, civil, and information),” and “activities [that] exploit the thresholds of detection and attribution, as well as the border between war and peace.”\\nThe aim, the Helsinki-based center says, is to\\n“influence different forms of decision-making at the local (regional), state,\\nor institutional level to favor and/or gain the agent’s strategic goals while\\nundermining and/or hurting the target.”\\nOf course, cyberattacks, economic warfare, energy\\nwarfare, and the use of “little green men” are all crucial components of\\nRussia’s strategy. Its most effective tool is probably its propaganda and influence\\noperations in the form of dubious nongovernmental organizations and the funding\\nof political parties. \\nMoscow is very active in the nongovernmental organization world, showing a tendency to fund those organizations and think tanks in the U.S. and Europe to advance its energy, strategic, and political goals. Russia has funded shell organizations and fake think tanks that promote anti-fracking messages in the U.S. and Romania. \\nIn a story first reported by The Daily Signal\\xa0in 2017, the chairman of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee wrote to the Treasury secretary to complain about a dubious nonprofit called Sea Change with links to Russian money and pushing an anti-fracking agenda in the U.S. \\nIn 2014, the secretary-general of NATO accused\\nRussia of doing the same thing in Romania.\\xa0 \\nIn Georgia, a nation under constant Russian pressure,\\nMoscow constantly sows division in society by funding nongovernmental\\norganizations—the founders and managers of which are often\\nthe same people. \\nJust recently, in a report in the United Kingdom’s Sunday Times, the Brussels-based Open Dialogue Foundation was accused of working with Russian security services and of receiving funding from Moscow to spread misinformation in countries that opposed the Kremlin’s policies. \\nThe Kremlin link was dismissed by the foundation, but considering its past support for dubious individuals (for example, convicted fraudster Mukhtar Ablyazov and Uzbek-born businessman Nail Malyutin, who is currently in prison and who has close links to organized crime), it’s not surprising that people question its wider motives.\\nAccording to another Sunday Times report, 1.5 million pounds (more than $1.8 million) from offshore areas of “dubious, unknown routes and origins” were sent to the accounts of two firms in Britain and ended up in the bank account of the Open Dialogue Foundation, which was allegedly used to fund lobbying campaigns. Its director, Lyudmyla Kozlovska, was even banned from traveling in much of the European Union by Poland last year.\\nRussia also expands its reach through the attempted funding\\nand influencing of political parties.\\xa0 \\nAn investigation last month uncovered a plot between an associate of Matteo Salvini, the leader of the far-right populist Italian Lega party, and Russian businessmen to covertly fund the Lega’s election campaigning.\\nProsecutors in Milan, Italy, have since started an investigation into the latter. Salvini, who also serves as Italy’s deputy prime minister, holds Moscow-friendly views on contentious issues, such as Russia’s annexation of Crimea. \\nAnother example of Moscow’s reach is the troublesome ideological and financial connection between Russia and Marine Le Pen, leader of France’s far right National Rally party (formally known as the National Front). Le Pen’s positions often mirror those of the Kremlin—whether it’s calling Syrian President Bashar Assad\\xa0“the most reassuring solution for France”\\xa0or backing the Russian takeover and\\xa0occupation of Crimea.\\nDuring the most recent French presidential elections, Le Pen\\xa0met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, a curious thing to do at a time when France had joined other European countries to slap economic sanctions on Russia.\\nMeanwhile, her party is still trying to pay off a loan\\nworth\\xa0$12.2\\nmillion\\xa0from a small—and now defunct—Russian bank.\\nSo, as the international community is focused on the\\nRussian war machine in Syria or eastern Ukraine, or the illegal occupation of\\nCrimea and Abkhazia, policymakers cannot ignore the softer aspects of Russia’s\\nwar against the West. \\nSo, how do we make our societies more resilient against\\nRussia’s influence operations and propaganda? \\nThe most important thing to do is to deny Russia the fertile soil in which to sow the seeds of instability. That can be done in three ways. \\xa0\\xa0\\nFirst, establish good governance on the local and\\nnational level. If people think they are being governed fairly and governed\\nwell, then they become less susceptible to Russian disinformation and\\npropaganda efforts. \\nSecond, there must be economic freedom. People need to believe\\nthey have economic stability and that their children have a bright economic\\nfuture. \\nFinally, there must be a bond of trust and respect\\nbetween the average person and their nation’s law enforcement and intelligence\\nservices. If people believe they are being policed fairly and that intelligence\\nservices are not overstepping their bounds, then society will become more\\nresilient against Russian hybrid tactics.',\n",
       " 'Anybody in the inner circle of Russian strongman Vladimir Putin who might have cheered President Donald Trump’s victory in 2016 must now be sorely disappointed.\\nWhen it comes to dealing with\\xa0Russia, Trump has been the toughest president since Ronald Reagan. He has sent advanced weapons to the Ukrainians and Georgians, increased U.S. defense spending in Europe, enlarged NATO, kicked out scores of Russian diplomats, and recently announced that the U.S. will withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.\\nBut perhaps Trump’s biggest impact has been with economic sanctions. He has slapped them on more than 200 Russian oligarchs and senior government officials and dozens of Russian organizations and companies.\\nThese measures strike at the kleptocratic heart of Putin’s inner circle—and they are starting to bite. How do we know? Because Russian companies under U.S. sanctions are trying to find creative ways of getting off the sanctions list.\\nLeading the charge is Russian aluminum giant Rusal, owned by Putin crony Oleg Deripaska. In August, Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin implied that sanctions against Rusal could be lifted if Deripaska, who is personally sanctioned by the U.S. government, shows he is no longer the company’s majority shareholder.\\nSeveral days after Mnuchin’s comments, Deripaska’s team of attorneys submitted a plan to the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the division inside the Treasury Department that would decide whether he actually has ceded control of the company.\\nLast week, Rusal missed a deadline to show that it had satisfactorily restructured its ownership to meet U.S. concerns. Astonishingly, instead of saying “Sorry, too little, too late” to Deripaska and his attorneys, Treasury gave them more time to make their case.\\nThis is an incredibly high-profile case, and Treasury’s wobbliness has led other Russian companies to believe they can also restructure their ownership to get off the U.S. sanctions list, too.\\nLast week, it was announced that Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg, who owns the Renova Group—a massive conglomerate with business interests in the energy, construction and telecommunications sectors—was going to appeal to the Office of Foreign Assets Control to lift the sanctions put on him and his business interests.\\nIf the office lifts sanctions on Rusal or the Renova Group, it would be the first crack in the sanctions regime since the Obama administration introduced it 2014. It would send the wrong signals to friend and foe alike.\\nLetting the likes of Deripaska and Vekselberg off the hook because of their dubious “business restructuring” gambit would set an army of Russian lawyers to working overtime to get other firms off the sanctions list, too.\\nMany of America’s allies in Europe are watching what the Treasury does, too. Sadly, some of them with uncomfortably close relations with Moscow are looking for the first excuse to reduce their sanctions against\\xa0Russia. The Treasury should not become that first excuse.\\nAt the end of the day, as massive Russian companies with global interests, Rusal and the Renova Group should remain sanctioned even if their respective owners give up all control. After all, in the case of Rusal, the aluminum it produces has helped build the Russian war machine we are seeing in action in places like Ukraine and Syria. So it hardly matters if Deripaska has a controlling stake or not.\\nIt should come as no surprise that Russian companies are trying to get off the sanctions list. Russian companies, like companies around the world, have a responsibility to their shareholders to deliver profits. Obviously, being on the U.S. sanctions list is bad for business. However, the administration needs to realize that it, too, has a responsibility to its shareholders—the American people.\\nUntil\\xa0Russia\\xa0changes its behavior on the international stage—stops occupying Crimea, ends its support for Syrian dictator Bashar Assad, and stops its support of separatists in eastern Ukraine—it remains in America’s interest to keep the sanctions in place.\\nOriginally published by The Washington Times',\n",
       " 'Just 72 hours after the election of former actor and comedian\\nVolodymyr Zelenskiy as Ukraine’s next president, Russian President Vladimir Putin\\nhas given him his first geopolitical challenge. \\nPutin signed\\na decree on Wednesday stating that those who live in the parts\\nof Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions that are currently controlled by\\nMoscow-backed separatists will be issued Russian passports.\\nUkraine’s newly elected president was quick to\\ncriticize Putin’s decree. He suggested that\\nUkraine should instead issue Ukrainian passports “to all people who suffer from authoritarian\\nand corrupt regimes,” first and foremost “to the Russian people who\\nsuffer most of all.” \\nPutin’s recent action should come as no surprise. Moscow has been issuing Russian passports to citizens of other former Soviet countries for years. \\nThis policy of “passportization” is completely in line with Putin’s foreign policy mentality. During his 2005 State of the Nation address to the Russian parliament, Putin infamously said, “We should acknowledge that the collapse of the Soviet Union was the major geopolitical disaster of the 20th century.”\\nIn that same speech, he also said: “For the Russian nation, [the collapse of\\nthe USSR] became a genuine drama. Tens of millions of our co-citizens and\\ncompatriots found themselves outside Russian territory.” \\nUnder Putin’s leadership, Russia has designated itself the protector of\\nthese ethnic Russians—no matter where in the world they may be. \\nMoscow has long embraced this “protector of ethnic Russians” status under Putin—formally known as the Compatriot Policy—and all levels of his government have followed suit. \\nPutin’s\\nmost recent passport decree is also nothing new. \\nIn\\n2002, approximately\\n150,000 people\\nliving the Georgian region of Abkhazia were granted Russian citizenship. This\\nforeshadowed Moscow’s actions in 2008, when Russia invaded Georgia. At this time,\\nRussian passports were handed out in the Georgian\\nregions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. \\nAfter\\nseeing this take place, Ukrainian officials were nervous that Russia might\\nissue passports to its citizens in Crimea. That fear became a reality in 2014,\\nwhen Russian forces invaded and annexed Crimea and granted Russian citizenship to\\neveryone living there. \\nSo,\\nlooking at Putin’s track record, his passport decree on Wednesday was a\\npredictable next step. \\nIn the middle of the 19th century, British\\nPrime Minister and Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston said of Russia:\\xa0 \\nThe policy and practice of the Russian government has always been to push forward its encroachments as fast and as far as the apathy or want of firmness of other governments would allow it to go, but always to stop and retire when it met with decided resistance and then to wait for the next favorable opportunity.\\nLooking at recent actions in Ukraine, it\\nseems that what was true of Imperial Russia is true of Putin’s Russia. \\nRussia has been able to exploit its\\nneighbors’ vulnerability to its own benefit, calculating that the West won’t\\nrespond in any significant way. \\nAs Lord Palmerston knew so well, Russia\\nwill do what it knows it can get away with. No more and no less. \\nPutin’s move to issue passports in eastern Ukraine is a\\nclear affront to Ukraine’s sovereignty. It is also a test for the new Ukrainian\\npresident. \\xa0\\nMost importantly, though, this cavalier decision by\\nMoscow shows that those running the Kremlin do not want better relations with\\nthe West. \\nWestern leaders should not believe otherwise.

       " 'Alexis Mrachek\\n/\\n@AlexisMrachek\\n\\nAlexis Mrachek is a research assistant for Russia and Eurasia at The Heritage Foundation.\\nOn Friday, in his meeting with the Group of Seven countries, President Donald Trump proposed that Russia be able to rejoin the G-7.\\nRussian President Vladimir Putin would need to do much to re-qualify for that privilege, since Russia still retains its hold on Crimea and maintains troops in eastern Ukraine. After all, these are the very reasons Russia was originally ousted from the group in March 2014.\\nThe G-7 comprises seven of the world’s advanced industrialized economies. They are also all democracies. These same countries happen to be America’s close allies, too—Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom. The group meets annually to discuss issues such as shared global security and economic matters.\\nOver four years ago, Russia actually was part of the group, which then was known as the G-8. Russia first joined the G-8 in 1997 when Boris Yeltsin was still in power. Back then, Western relations with Russia looked promising, so it made perfect sense for the eight countries to align.\\nHowever, when Russia decided in March 2014 to illegally annex Crimea and invade the Donbas region of Ukraine, it proved it was no longer a trustworthy actor on the international stage. Thus, the G-8 removed Moscow and reverted back to the G-7.\\nOn Friday, Trump suggested that Russia should be readmitted into the group. But before this can happen, at a minimum Russia must do the following:\\nIn May 2018, Russia was found responsible for the tragedy but Putin denies it. In addition to owning up, Russia must formally apologize to and suitably compensate the families of those who lost loved ones in the incident.\\nThe G-7 is an organization that allows like-minded democracies to work together to tackle many of the world’s major problems. Putin has not demonstrated that he can be a trusted partner, and Trump is wrong to say that Russia should now be allowed back in the club.\\nHowever, if Russia changes its ways, it should be invited back into the G-7. Russia is a proud country. For better or for worse, it possesses a history of being at the center of global affairs. But it can only re-enter the G-7 once it demonstrates that it is a responsible and collegiate actor on the international stage.\\nSadly, this is unlikely to occur while Putin is in power. The Russian people will continue to suffer, and Russian influence on the international stage will continue to be marginalized.',\n",
       " 'With each successful Taliban attack, the inevitable headlines appear about America’s failures in Afghanistan.\\nThat’s why, as President Donald Trump reviews his Afghan policy this summer, it is important that he does not start seeing every tactical victory of the Taliban as America’s strategic defeat.\\nOverall, good progress has been made in Afghanistan, and Trump should remain committed to the strategy he outlined last year.\\nAfter the 9/11 attacks, there were two main goals in Afghanistan: First, to deny al-Qaeda a safe haven from which to plan, train, and launch terrorist attacks on a global scale, and second, to remove the Taliban regime from power as punishment for not cooperating with the international community and for harboring terrorism.\\nBoth were accomplished with relative speed.\\nAs the years went by, the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan was defined around the quixotic goals of creating “a strong central government” and a “pluralistic society.”\\nWe have tried accomplishing these goals by “holding free and fair” elections, “tackling corruption,” and building the “institutions of democracy.”\\nThat created an impossible situation for the U.S. military. With the lofty goals of nation-building defining our success in the early days, the only thing most people see today in Afghanistan is failure.\\nFar from having failed in Afghanistan, the U.S. and its allies have delivered considerable progress in Afghanistan.\\nAfter the successful targeting of Taliban leaders, combined with a robust counterinsurgency campaign over the years, the Taliban as a national movement has degenerated into several smaller, weaker, and localized insurgencies—each with a different set of grievances and goals.\\nEven with the recent horrific attacks in Kabul, the level of violence in Afghanistan is nowhere close to its peak.\\nAl-Qaeda, which once used Afghan territory with impunity, no longer enjoys a safe haven in Afghanistan. The threat posed to Afghanistan by the Islamic State is not even close to being in the same league as the Taliban, and pales in comparison to the terrorist group’s other affiliates in Syria, Libya, and Yemen.\\nNo major terrorist attack originating from Afghanistan has been successful in the United States since 2001.\\nThe Taliban that rolled into Kandahar and Kabul in the mid-1990s with tanks and planes is a shadow of its former self today.\\nIn 2001, outside of a small rump of territory run by the Northern Alliance in northeast Afghanistan, the Taliban controlled 90 percent of the entire country. Today, according to the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction’s most recent quarterly report to Congress, the Taliban has “control or influence” in an area equaling only 13 percent of the country’s population.\\nBy contrast, 65 percent of Afghanistan’s population live under the “control or influence” of the Afghan government. The remaining 22 percent of the population lives in “contested” areas.\\nThat is not bad. Al-Qaeda is essentially gone. ISIS is unable to establish a meaningful foothold in the country. The once omnipresent Taliban has been relegated to a divided and disparate insurgency.\\nEven so, there is a constant drumbeat of articles and commentary talking about America’s failure in Afghanistan. It is unclear what would make these critics of the Afghan war happy. Would they be happy when only 10 percent of Afghanistan’s population was under Taliban control? Five percent? None?\\nAfter almost 17 years of warfare, maybe we should come to terms with the fact that until there is a genuine political settlement between all warring parties, and until Pakistan stops providing succor to the Taliban, what we see in Afghanistan might be as good as it’s going to get.\\nThe American public has every reason to be proud of what the U.S. military has accomplished under very challenging circumstances in Afghanistan.\\nIt is time that we have a dose of realism of what to expect in Afghanistan and lower our expectations on what is achievable for the future. Afghanistan will not be perfect or suddenly become some Switzerland in the Hindu Kush.\\nUnless you are some idealistic dreamer who has never stepped foot in the country, that was never the goal.\\nSuccess will be achieved when there is a stable enough Afghanistan—that is, when it is able to manage its own internal and external security to a degree that stops interference from outside powers, allowing the country to resist the re-establishment of terrorist bases that were there before. Nothing more and nothing less.\\nThe immediate criticism of Trump’s strategy last year was based on the argument that 4,000 more trainers will not be able to do in 2018 what more than 100,000 U.S. troops were unable to do in 2011.\\nBut this argument stems from an old way of thinking about America’s role in Afghanistan. The war being fought in Afghanistan today is not the same war as in 2001 or even 2009 (the year President Barack Obama unveiled his Afghan strategy), when the U.S. was leading combat operations.\\nToday, the Afghans are in the lead, and the U.S. mission is one of training, advising, and assisting.\\nThe Afghan security forces are that country’s ticket to long-term security and stability. If the U.S. and its allies continue to mentor, train, and fund the Afghan military, the Afghans will be able to do a better job at taking on the insurgency themselves.\\nNot only will that help the Afghans prevent their country from becoming a hub for transnational terrorism, but it also will eventually establish the security conditions in which a genuine political process can take place. That latter point is the most important.\\nIn his speech last year when announcing his new strategy, Trump alluded to an eventual political settlement “after an effective military effort.” That is right. You can no more fight your way out of a insurgency campaign any more than you can drink yourself out of alcoholism.\\nThe goal of any counterinsurgency is to allow those who have legitimate political grievances the ability to address these grievances through a political process and not through violence.\\nIf the insurgency in Afghanistan ever ends, it will be through a political settlement between the Afghan government and the Taliban.\\nAs Trump makes a decision later this summer about the future of the U.S. role in Afghanistan, he needs to start measuring success by achievements on the ground and not by unrealistic expectations.\\nThe president should drown out the constant criticism of the campaign and remain committed to the realistic, reasonable, and responsible strategy he outlined last year.\\nAfghanistan is a complex place. There is a huge space between victory and defeat. That is where we are today—and where we will likely be for the foreseeable future.\\nThat does not mean we have failed. That is simply reality.',\n",
       " 'As the territorial integrity of ISIS’ “caliphate” in Iraq and Syria erodes, the terror group now finds itself looking to its contingent group in Afghanistan, known as the Islamic State in Khorasan, or IS-K, in order to maintain its operations.\\nIn the northern Afghan province of Jowzjan, IS-K has been actively recruiting fighters associated with al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan.\\nBut the terror groups in Afghanistan are hardly unified. As ISIS makes inroads there, competition among various groups is emerging, with each seeking to tap into a common pool of militants.\\nThis growth of militant organizations makes the Trump administration’s new aggressive strategy all the more vital.\\nA key part of this strategy dates back to the original U.S. mission from 2001: denying terrorists a safe haven from which to plot terrorist attacks. It also includes the more recent measure of holding Pakistan accountable for the role it has played in destabilizing the region.\\nOne of the most critical changes in the new strategy is the removal of cumbersome, Obama-era restrictions on the use of U.S. air power.\\nUnder the Obama administration, the U.S. only allowed the use of airstrikes when U.S. or coalition forces were under imminent attack. Now, under the new policy, commanders on the ground have broader authority to use airstrikes as they see fit.\\nThe effects of this change have already produced an obvious result.\\nFrom the time the Afghan strategy was unveiled in August 2017 to Dec. 31, 2017, the U.S. carried out around 2,000 airstrikes against the Taliban and associated groups. This is nearly as many airstrikes as in all of 2015 and 2016 combined. Almost one-quarter of these strikes (455) occurred in December, compared with a mere 65 in the same time period the year before.\\nOn a related note, in November 2017, U.S. and coalition forces conducted joint operations that produced a devastating result against Taliban drug labs. These joint operations destroyed at least 25 labs and have reportedly cost the Taliban upward of $20 million in lost revenue.\\nIn the most recent development, which occurred on April 9 of this year, one of Afghanistan’s most powerful warlords—Qari Hekmatullah—was killed in the northern Afghan province of Fayab by a U.S. airstrike. Hekmatullah was previously a member of the Taliban, but departed in favor of leading the northern branch of IS-K.\\nAfter switching allegiances, Hekmatullah had\\xa0survived several Taliban attempts to oust him from northern Afghanistan. Hekmatullah proved resilient against those attempts and continued to play a critical role in recruiting militants for IS-K.\\nHekmatullah’s death comes at a time of renewed military pressure on IS-K from both Afghan and U.S. special operations forces. According to NATO, these factors have reduced IS-K to an isolated group devoid of leadership.\\nThis new Afghan strategy is a breath of fresh air in what is now America’s longest war. This new approach may be exactly what is required not only to prevent ISIS from establishing itself in the country, but to break past the security stalemate that has characterized this conflict for so long.\\nThe Trump administration should measure its success in Afghanistan incrementally, based on conditions on the ground and with an eye toward the future. As a Taliban commander once mused, “You [the West] have the watches, but we have the time.”\\nWe would be wise to consider that statement and disavow any lofty, short-term expectations in favor of a realistic outlook that embraces the true, protracted nature of America’s longest war.',\n",

Spoehr, a retired Army lieutenant general, is director of the Center for National Defense at The Heritage Foundation.\\n\\nWalter Lohman\\n\\nWalter Lohman is Director of The Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center.\\nThere have been recent media reports that up to 7,000 U.S. troops, roughly half of the number of troops there, will be removed from Afghanistan. There has been no official statement from the Trump administration confirming this and it is important to stress that senior officials are saying privately that no final decision has been taken.\\nAfter more than 17 years of a U.S. military presence in Afghanistan it is only natural to question the value of the mission. However, most of the criticism about the mission today comes from failing to see the mission for what it now is: a training, advising, and assisting mission for the Afghanistan National Defense and Security Forces (ANSDF).\\nToday, we are not dealing with the same situation in Afghanistan as in 2001 right after the U.S. invaded and ousted the Taliban. We are also not facing the same Afghanistan as in 2009 when President Barack Obama announced his surge policy and increased U.S. troops to its peak of 100,000 leading day-to-day combat operations.\\nToday there is a relatively small contingent of about 14,000 U.S. troops—the vast majority of which are training and mentoring the ANSDF. It is true that a small number of these troops are conducting high-end special operations missions to target senior Taliban leadership, remnants of al-Qaeda, and the nascent Islamic State of the Khorasan Province. But these missions are the exception rather than the rule.\\nA training mission coupled with a high-end special operations mission is something the U.S. does in countless countries around the world. It is through the lens of a training mission that we should see the U.S. presence in Afghanistan today, not as an extension of the war that has been raging since 2001.\\nIn addition to misunderstanding what kind of mission the U.S. is performing in Afghanistan, there is an extreme pessimism regarding what has been accomplished in Afghanistan.\\nThe New York Times recently reported that “the Taliban are stronger than ever.”\\xa0This is pure sensationalism that is totally divorced from the reality. The Taliban today is nothing like the Taliban in 1996 when it rolled into Kandahar and Kabul and operated tanks and flew planes.\\nOn Sept. 10, 2001, the Taliban controlled 90 percent of the entire country outside a small rump in northeastern Afghanistan controlled by the Northern Alliance. During this time all major road networks, all of the major population centers, and the capital city Kabul were under Taliban control.\\nThe situation could not be more different today.\\nAccording to the most recent report from the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction—hardly known for sugar coating the situation in Afghanistan—the Taliban “controls or influences” areas where only 10.5 percent of Afghanistan’s population live (a 1.5 percent decrease from the previous quarter’s report).\\nConversely, the Afghan government “controls or influences” areas where 65 percent of the Afghanistan population resides. The Taliban has not come close to retaking Kabul. In fact, in recent years, the Taliban has only been able to hold parts of a district center on two occasions and only for a few days at a time before being expelled.\\nYes, the Taliban might successfully raid an Afghan army base. It might successfully detonate a suicide bomber in Kabul, killing scores. On occasion it might hold parts of a district center for a few days. But we need to stop treating every tactical victory of the Taliban’s as America’s strategic defeat.\\nThere is a huge space between victory and defeat and that is where the U.S. is today in Afghanistan and that is where the U.S. is likely to remain for the foreseeable future. Until there is a genuine peace settlement between all Afghans, and until Pakistan stops providing succor to the Taliban, we should accept that this is as good as it is going to get. This is not defeat. This is reality.\\nWe should also stop using vague notions of nation building to judge our progress in Afghanistan. We are there to help create a stable enough Afghanistan so it can manage its own internal security without the presence of tens of thousands of foreign troops helping it. Nothing more. Nothing less. This way the Afghans can stop their country from becoming a hub for transnational terrorism like it was before 2001. This will also help bring stability to an increasingly important region of the world.\\nA crucial part of accomplishing this goal is the training mission. We saw what happened when Obama abruptly withdrew the U.S. training mission in Iraq in December 2011. Only two years later ISIS had taken Mosul and was knocking on the gates of Baghdad. For the sake of 14,000 trainers in Afghanistan, now is not the time to needlessly repeat the pricy mistakes of the past in Iraq.\\nThere is also the political process to consider. The objective of any counterinsurgency is to give those people who have legitimate political grievances the ability to address these grievances through political process and not through violence. After all, most successful counterinsurgency operations end with negotiated settlement.\\nThis is why the news coming out of the latest rounds of talks in Abu Dhabi is welcome. Hopefully, representatives of the Taliban will soon meet with officials from the Afghan government to start meaningful talks about bringing peace to Afghanistan after decades of war. The U.S. should support this process along the way but remain skeptical of the Taliban’s motives.\\nThe Taliban needs to prove that it is serious about talks because nothing in the past has shown it is a trustworthy actor. Withdrawing U.S. troops from Afghanistan—unless it was part of a broader confidence-building measure connected to the peace talks and coordinated with the Afghan government—could derail the talks before they get off to a meaningful start.\\nA capable ANDSF and a genuine political settlement led by the Afghans is the country’s best ticket to prosperity and America’s best hope for regional stability and security. This is why it is in America’s interest to continue with the training, advising in assisting mission in Afghanistan.\\nNow is not the time to abandon the Afghans and repeat the mistakes of Iraq.\",\n",

We're open for business, not for sale??????? learn more about Greenland on: https://t.co/WulOi3beIC\\nBuying options aside, this newfound attention—however short-lived—can only be positive for Greenland.\\nGreenland is a very important U.S. partner with a long and rich history. It was first discovered by Vikings in the 10th century, and was ruled by the Kingdom of Denmark and Norway until 1814. That year, the Treaty of Kiel transferred ownership to the Kingdom of Denmark after the union between Norway and Denmark ended. \\nGeographically, and to a certain extent culturally,\\nGreenland is part of North America—although much of its economic and historical\\nlinks are with Europe.\\nToday, Greenland is an autonomous\\nconstituent country of the Kingdom of Denmark. Greenland was granted home rule\\nin 1979 and self-government\\nin 2009. It has competency over most policy areas, with the big exceptions\\nbeing foreign affairs, defense, and monetary policy—all of which are still\\ncontrolled by Copenhagen. \\nThere is a strong desire in Greenland for full\\nindependence—especially among Greenland’s political elite. Only one political\\nparty does not support independence (and that party holds only one seat in the\\n31-seat parliament). \\nFor Greenland, the question is not if it will become\\nindependent, but when and how. \\nFew inside Greenland’s government think it is ready now,\\nbut Denmark’s official position is that Greenland can become independent\\nwhenever it pleases.\\nAfter Germany invaded Denmark in 1940, the U.S. quickly\\ndeployed forces to protect Greenland from Nazi Germany. Ever since, the U.S.\\nhas maintained a military presence on the island. \\nIn 1946, the Truman administration tried, unsuccessfully,\\nto\\nbuy the entire island from Denmark for $100 million. The U.S. was, however,\\ngranted long-term access to important military sites. \\nToday, the main U.S. military presence is at Thule Air Base\\nin the north of the country. Thule also serves as a very important early\\nwarning radar and satellite tracking station for the protection of the U.S.\\nhomeland.\\nSo while the U.S.-Greenland security relationship is already\\ngood, U.S. policymakers should use the president’s newfound interest in\\nGreenland to advance closer economic relations with the country and expand\\nAmerica’s diplomatic presence there.\\nGreenland has surprisingly few economic links with North America, given its geographical proximity. \\nFor instance, there are currently no direct flights from\\nthe U.S. to Greenland. The few direct flights that existed in the past were not\\nprofitable. The fishing industry accounts for 95% of Greenland’s exports, but\\nonly 1% of that goes to the U.S. \\nGreenland is making a conscious effort to change this\\nlack of connection with North America. Greenland’s national sea carrier, Royal\\nArctic Line, will be starting\\na weekly shipping service to Portland, Maine, later this year, and\\nGreenland’s government has been meeting with Maine government officials about\\nincreasing economic links. \\nThe only way to fly commercially to Greenland is from Iceland or Denmark, but that could change in the coming years. Greenland is set to begin construction on three new airports this year, to be finished in 2023 (in Qaqortoq, in the south; in Nuuk, the capital; and in Ilulissat, in the north). \\nGreenland’s government hopes the new airports will allow direct flights from North America and open up new opportunities for business and tourism.\\nThe U.S. is also making new initiatives. \\nAfter years of putting it on the back burner, the Trump administration recently announced that the U.S. will maintain a part-time diplomatic presence in Greenland. This is something The Heritage Foundation has been calling for. While this is a very welcome first step, over time this should become an enduring and permanent presence. \\nThe U.S. once had a consulate in Greenland, from 1940 to the early 1950s. Greenland is in America’s backyard and a critical part of America’s security architecture. \\nAn expanded U.S. diplomatic presence would demonstrate\\nthat the U.S. takes Greenland at a level of seriousness proportionate to its\\nrole in America’s security. It would also give the U.S. government a depth of\\nsituational awareness not possible without a consulate.\\nIn all the hubbub over whether or not Trump really wants\\nto buy Greenland, there’s been very little discussion about whether that would\\nbe a good idea even if it were possible. In particular, nobody is discussing the\\nfinancial burden that being responsible for Greenland would place on the U.S. \\nApproximately 55% of the Greenlandic government’s budget currently comes from Denmark in the form of a block grant. Moreover, no two cities or towns in Greenland are connected by a road, making travel and economic activity very difficult and expensive. And, many of the same social problems found in similar remote communities in Alaska are also found in Greenland, such as alcoholism and high suicide rates. \\nAs things currently stand, none of these costs could be\\noffset by the profitable exploitation of natural resources as some suggest. The\\nharsh environmental conditions and the lack of transport infrastructure limits\\nthe ability to take advantage of Greenland’s natural resources. \\nWhile there’s been much talk of Greenland’s mineral and\\nnatural resources, the fact is that there are currently only two active mines\\nin Greenland: the Aappaluttoq ruby mine and the Qaqortorsuaq anorthosite mine.\\nNeither are swimming in profit. \\xa0\\nTo put it simply, the U.S. doesn’t need to buy Greenland. A country like ours that is drowning in $22.5 trillion in national debt must prioritize its spending. \\nThe U.S. is already able to leverage its great relationship with Greenland and Denmark, and the U.S. enjoys access to Thule Air Base. Our strategic interests can be met without “purchasing” Greenland.\\xa0 \\nIt is impossible to know what Trump’s true opinion is on\\nGreenland one way or the other, but with his upcoming trip to Denmark, I am\\nsure this matter will be raised. \\nIn the end, who knows how much truth is in these media reports? After all, August is a slow month for media outlets. They could have been scrounging for “clicks.”\\nThis is not the 19th century, and Greenland is not for sale. Regardless what the Greenlanders choose—either remaining with Denmark, or becoming an independent nation—the U.S. should respect Greenland’s right to self-determination and continue to deepen relations.\\nUltimately, it is up to the people of Greenland to\\ndetermine how and by whom they wish to be governed.\",\n",

We are providing affordable energy to average Americans at home and our allies overseas.”\\nThe Sierra Club Foundation’s logo\\nUS Gains in Market\\nIn the fracking technique applied to shale formations, engineers inject water mixed with sand and chemicals into a well at high pressure, producing a fluid that fractures the rock and releases trapped oil or natural gas.\\nEnvironmentalists continue to challenge fracking, arguing among other things that it contaminates well water.\\nThe natural gas import-export equation has changed radically in the past few years, with trends pointing to the U.S. becoming a net exporter.\\nRichard Westerdale, the senior adviser with the State Department, made this point in November during the Heartland Institute’s America First Energy Conference in Houston, Texas.\\n“By 2020, the U.S. will be approaching nearly 100 billion cubic meters in [liquefied natural gas] exports,” Westerdale said in a presentation. “It’s simply amazing to me to think that back in 2010, we were building [liquefied natural gas] import terminals.”\\nAs natural gas markets become increasingly competitive, the “world wins,” he added, since “well-functioning markets reinforce global energy security, foster economic growth and commercial interests abroad, and, depending upon how host countries choose to use [natural gas resources], it can in fact enhance environmental stewardship.”\\nIn three of the first five months of 2017, U.S. natural gas exports were greater than imports, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The most recent available data shows that U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas increased for the duration of 2017 as new facilities went operational.\\nLogo of Sea Change Foundation\\nWhat Consumers Know\\nStiles, who teaches espionage and national security issues in Virginia Tech’s geography department, defines espionage, or spying, as “an operation that is planned and executed as to conceal the identity of, or permit plausible denial by, the sponsor.”\\nOne way for Moscow to conceal its sponsorship of anti-fracking campaigns in New York or elsewhere in the U.S. is to move its funding indirectly and anonymously through various entities, the former CIA analyst told The Daily Signal.\\n“I think the groups and individuals on both sides of the debate over fracking and pipelines have a tendency to just look in their own back yards, without looking at the larger geopolitical picture,” Stiles said. “If it was more widely known that anti-fracking, anti-pipeline operations may be benefitting from a foreign source of funding, this would certainly impact the debate.”\\n\\nThe agents of influence described by Stiles range from “controlled agents” and “trusted contacts” who know they’re working for a foreign government to “manipulated sources” who have no idea that they’re doing the bidding of a foreign power.\\nThe former CIA analyst said he is inclined to characterize environmental activists who received Russian funding through indirect channels, such as Sea Change or the Energy Foundation, as manipulated sources.\\nStiles calls on the leadership of environmental groups such as the Sierra Club and Natural Resources Defense Council, which accepted large amounts through such channels, to start asking hard questions.\\n“It’s either a lack of due diligence or incompetence, or they may actually know something about a particular donor, but they don’t want to ask that question,” Stiles said. “I tend to think the issue is more that they are just not looking the gift horse in the mouth, and they are just taking the money.”\\nEnergy Foundation’s logo\\nPaperless Money Trail\\nSea Change Foundation, a family charity, is identified in congressional reports and correspondence as a major incubator of funding from foreign sources, including Russia. That money ends up in the coffers of U.S. environmental groups opposed to natural gas development and drilling techniques such as fracking that make that development possible.\\nNathaniel Simons and his wife, Laura Baxter-Simons, established Sea Change Foundation in 2006. Simons is the son of James Simons, founder of the New York-based Renaissance Technologies hedge fund firm.\\nSea Change, according to its website, works to “address the serious threats posed by global climate change,” focusing on “climate change mitigation and clean energy policy in the United States and internationally.”\\nIn July 2014, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee released a report describing how a Bermuda-based company, Klein Ltd., “was set up for the sole purpose of funneling anonymous donations to Sea Change.”\\nBermuda law permits Klein Ltd. to conceal foreign sources of funding, the report explains.\\n“It appears that Klein exists on paper only, as it does not have an internet presence, and was set up for the sole purpose of funneling anonymous donations to Sea Change,” the report says.\\nSubsequent investigations building on the findings of the Senate committee—including that of the Washington-based Environmental Policy Alliance—established a connection between Wakefield Quin, the law firm that set up Klein, and top Kremlin officials, including Russian President Vladimir Putin.\\nLawyers and others at Wakefield Quin have been associated with Russian energy companies and worked with Leonid Reiman, a former Russian minister of telecommunications and longtime Putin ally, these investigations found.\\nEnvironmental Policy Alliance, which opposes the agenda of liberal green groups, is affiliated with Washington lobbyist Rick Berman and his Berman & Co. public affairs firm.\\nSea Change has not responded directly to The Daily Signal in the past, and did not respond for this report.\\nIn an email to Salon, however, the foundation in July 2017 acknowledged receiving financial support from Klein, saying it accepted the company’s grant money as “general support” with no proviso that it be used for specific programs.\\nResponse From Klein Ltd.\\nIn an email to The Daily Signal,\\xa0Roderick M. Forrest, a Wakefield Quin lawyer representing Klein Ltd., described allegations against his Bermuda-based client as “completely false and irresponsible.” Klein, he said, “has no Russian connection whatsoever.”\\nForrest made similar assertions in an email to The Washington Times in July 2017.\\nThe Daily Signal had sought the law firm’s comment on allegations of Russian funding of U.S. environmental groups and Klein’s alleged role in easing movement of Russian funds to the Sea Change Foundation.\\n“Our firm has represented Klein since its inception,” Forrest said in the email, “and we can state categorically that at no point did this philanthropic organization receive or expend funds from Russian sources or Russian-connected sources and Klein has no Russian connection whatsoever.”\\nThe lawyer for Klein added:\\nAttorneys, law firms, financial institutions and all other companies based in Bermuda operate under a regulatory and anti-money laundering regime which applies standards which are amongst the highest in the world. Illicit movement of funds falls well below such standards and any informed party would understand that, not only is there no substance or truth to such allegations in this case, the allegations appear to be intended to damage the reputation of the Bermuda-based individuals and businesses named.\\nBermuda and the U.S. have in place an information exchange framework under which the U.S. government, its regulators and law enforcement agencies have access to all information concerning financial transactions in Bermuda and by Bermuda entities. Through this framework, information is available to such proper authorities, enabling them to be satisfied as to the probity of any alleged payments.\\nJulie\\xa0Hill, a professor at University of Alabama\\xa0School of Law with expertise in regulation of financial institutions, told The Daily Signal that it is not “as easy as it was at one time to engage in money laundering” in places such as Bermuda and the Cayman Islands.\\nThat’s because monetary authorities now collect more information from companies than they did previously, Hill said.\\n“This information is not made public, but it can be given to foreign governments,”\\xa0Hill\\xa0said in an interview, adding:\\nThe advantage in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands now would be more in terms of tax neutrality rather than anonymity. But it’s certainly true that various entities have in the past engaged in money laundering schemes in these locations, and the Russians would be part of this history.\\xa0Today there are more barriers than in the past. That doesn’t mean it can’t be done, it just means it’s harder.\\n‘Ripe for Investigation’\\nRep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, sent a letter in June to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin saying allegations of Russian financial support for U.S. environmental groups “are ripe for an investigation” by the Treasury Department.\\nIn the letter, previously reported by The Daily Signal, Smith noted that Klein Ltd. and Wakefield Quin share the same Bermuda address “with more than 20 other companies” apparently run through the law firm.\\nA review of IRS 990 Forms shows that Klein contributed $23 million to Sea Change in 2010 and 2011, almost half of what the California foundation received in that time. The 990 forms indicate Sea Change then made grants concentrated on environmental advocacy groups.\\nFrom 2010 \\xa0through 2015, the Sierra Club Foundation received more than $18 million from Sea Change and Natural Resources Defense Council received more than $15 million.\\nBoth groups are on record opposing natural gas development in New York, and both are among the top 10 recipients of Sea Change grants, according to an analysis of foundation records.\\nThe Energy Foundation, at $64 million, was the top recipient of Sea Change grants from 2010 through 2015, the most recent year for which 990s are available.\\nThe 2014 Senate report describes the Energy Foundation as a “pass through” public charity that donates to environmental activist groups such as the Sierra Club Foundation and Natural Resources Defense Council.\\nThe idea behind a “pass through” organization, according to the Senate report, is “to create the appearance of a more diversified base of support” and to “shield” donors from accountability.\\nBetween 1998 and 2015, the Energy Foundation paid 30,178 grants to 12,058 recipients totaling more than $1.2 billion, records show. Grantees included environmental groups active in opposing natural gas development of the Marcellus Shale.\\nThe top recipient was Natural Resources Defense Council, with more than $35 million. The Sierra Club Foundation received more than $16 million. (The council has $236.5 million in net assets, while the foundation has $113.2 million in net assets.)\\nRecalling Cold War History\\n\\nPaul Kengor, a Grove City College political science professor who has researched the history of Moscow’s manipulation of U.S. political figures, told The Daily Signal that he sees an “old Cold War powder keg that went dry suddenly being reignited.”\\n“What makes the current situation more nefarious today is the possibility—if this is indeed accurate—of Russian manipulation of domestic groups inside the United States and the willful cooperation of those domestic environmentalists,” Kengor, a biographer of Ronald Reagan, said in an email, adding:\\nIn the 1980s, Ronald Reagan had one heck of a time trying to enlist the support of our Western allies in blocking the Siberian gas pipeline in Russia. Even [British Prime Minister] Margaret Thatcher balked; in fact, that’s an understatement: Thatcher was vehemently opposed because she wanted Britain to have the cheap Russian gas and wanted some British firms to have some of the construction contracts. The same was true for the West Germans and the French.\\nRonald Reagan boldly proceeded almost alone in this effort in the 1980s. But here today … we have the extremely troubling possibility of our own U.S. citizens being targeted by the Russians for manipulation in undercutting our own domestic energy industry, our workers, and our citizens.\\nWhat stands out in terms of Cold War history and its relevance to contemporary questions of espionage is the role of Putin, warns Bonner Cohen, a senior fellow with the National Center for Public Policy Research, a Washington-based think tank that supports free market solutions to policy challenges.\\n“Putin, let’s not forget, is an old hand at using Western pressure groups to serve the Kremlin’s purposes,” Cohen said in an email.\\n“When, in the 1980s, the old Soviet Union was manipulating self-styled ‘peace groups’ in Western Europe and the U.S. in an effort to divide NATO and isolate the U.S., Putin was a mid-level KGB agent in East Germany.”\\nCohen added:\\nThough that effort ultimately failed, Putin learned his lesson well. Then it was U.S. missiles to defend Western Europe that had to be demonized; today, it is U.S. oil and natural gas that are portrayed as a threat. In both cases, money changed hands, and scare tactics were the order of the day.\\nNew Yorkers and High Energy Costs\\nNew York residents continue to pay the price for Cuomo’s ban on drilling techniques that make it possible to access natural gas from the Marcellus Shale, laments Moreau, executive director of the American Petroleum Institute’s New York office.\\n“People who could have had inexpensive natural gas instead have had to pay very high electricity prices due to the cold snap this winter,” Moreau told The Daily Signal, “and many power generators were actually forced to burn oil instead of natural gas due to the constraints on natural gas.”\\nThe 625 members of API, a national trade association, include major energy companies in the oil and gas industry.\\nAlthough New York is the fourth-largest consumer of natural gas in the nation, that natural gas primarily is imported from other states, Moreau said.\\n“If not for the pro-energy development policies of other states, New Yorkers would be bitterly freezing this winter,” she said.\\nThe Daily Signal sought comment from Cuomo’s office to ask if the New York governor had concerns about allegations of Russian support for environmental groups active in his state. His office has not responded.\\nCohen, of the National Center for Public Policy Research, said he sees a connection between Putin’s government in Moscow and influential U.S. environmental groups that is difficult to deny.\\n“The Sierra Club, Natural Resources Defense Council, and other advocacy groups may have their own ‘green’ reasons for opposing America’s realizing the energy potential of its abundant fossil fuels,” Cohen said in an email to The Daily Signal. \\xa0“At the same time, these groups know full well that they receive funding from the Sea Change Foundation and the Energy Foundation, both of which, according to a congressional report, are funded by Russian interests via a Bermuda-based shell company.”\\nSome green groups and Russia under Putin “have a common interest in demonizing fracking and related technologies that have tilted global energy markets in America’s favor,” Cohen said.\\n“Just as the shale revolution has been an economic godsend to millions of Americans, providing them with affordable electricity and transportation fuel, it has been a nightmare for Russia and environmental activists.”\\nKen McIntyre contributed to this report.',\n",
       " 'One of the dramatic signs opposing the proposed PennEast Pipeline that dot a road in Hopewell Township, New Jersey. The natural gas pipeline awaits federal approval. (Photo: Kevin Mooney/The Daily Signal)\\nAnyone traveling along the roadways that run parallel to that part of the Delaware River where George Washington staged his famous Christmas night crossing in 1776 is sure to encounter signs that take aim at an energy project known as the PennEast Pipeline.\\nSome of those signs invoke revolutionary language with statements that claim “We the People Say No to PennEast.” \\nOther signs say: “Don’t Let them Poison Our Water! Stop PennEast,” “Pipeline Blast Zone, Stop PennEast,” “Just Say No! Stop PennEast,” and “Stop the Fracking Pipelines.” \\nThe messages opposing the natural gas pipeline can be spotted along roadways on both the Pennsylvania and New Jersey sides of the river.\\nAny day now, the six energy companies that are part of the PennEast Pipeline project expect to get a green light to proceed from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates the interstate transmission of natural gas, oil, and electricity. That approval would come in the form of a certificate allowing construction and operation of the pipeline.\\nThe anti-pipeline signs and mailings mention ReThink Energy NJ, a coalition of environmentalists who\\xa0have received substantial funding from the Philadelphia-based William Penn Foundation.\\nUnder current plans, the proposed 120-mile-long, 36-inch-diameter, underground pipeline would originate just north of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, in an area that interconnects with other major interstate pipelines that serve markets on the East Coast, including New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. \\nWilkes-Barre, the county seat of Luzerne County, sits on the outskirts of the Pocono Mountains in the northeastern part of Pennsylvania.\\nIf the federal commission OKs it, a year from now a new pipeline will be poised to transport natural gas across Eastern Pennsylvania and the Delaware River into Mercer County, New Jersey, where it will interconnect with the Transco Pipeline in the borough of Pennington.\\nThe PennEast Pipeline would draw from natural gas produced in the Marcellus shale formation that cuts across Pennsylvania, New York, and parts of Ohio and West Virginia.\\n(Map: Philadelphia Inquirer/Newscom)\\n‘The Least Cost Available’\\nTony Cox, project manager for PennEast, told The Daily Signal in an interview that he expects energy consumers in Pennsylvania and New Jersey to begin to see the benefits of the pipeline beginning in the winter of 2018-2019. \\nWith approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission expected this fall, the seven-month construction phase would begin next spring, and the pipeline would become operational in the second half of next year, according to PennEast’s projected timeline.\\n“September is what we call a ‘shoulder month’ in the gas industry, because you are past the summer months, but you are not yet in the winter. This means you are in a period of low energy consumption,” Cox said, adding:\\nBut we still see a vast disparity between the price of gas in the Marcellus region and in New Jersey. These price differences around the country are one of the drivers for natural gas infrastructure, and one of the obligations that gas utilities have is to procure the least cost of gas available. \\nRight now, as it relates to New Jersey, that gas is located 100 miles away in Pennsylvania. But as we can see from the price difference, there is not ample infrastructure to get the gas to where it needs to go.\\nAs of late September, Cox noted, the price for natural gas delivery in the Marcellus Shale region was $1.79 per dekatherm (a unit of energy measurement), compared with $3.16 per dekatherm in New Jersey, according to Gas Daily, a publication that provides the oil and gas industry with analytical reports on prices in the energy markets. That’s a difference of $1.37, or 76.5 percent higher, in New Jersey.\\n“Right now, there’s not enough capacity to meet the energy demands of New Jersey residents during peak periods, as evidenced by the large price differentials between these two areas,” Cox said. “With PennEast, we will have the ability to dampen the impact of high-demand periods and provide cost savings.”\\nWhen the $1.37 price difference for natural gas between the Marcellus area of Pennsylvania and New Jersey is “amplified by the capacity PennEast will have to transport natural gas,” Cox said, he anticipates “more than a half of a billion dollars in savings” to New Jersey consumers.\\nSierra Club Disputes Figures\\nThe PennEast project manager is not alone in projecting substantial savings.\\n PennEast proponents point to a study from Concentric Energy Advisors—which describes itself as an independent management consulting and financial advisory firm focused on the North American energy industry—that found PennEast would provide\\xa0 savings of more than $500 million for electricity and natural gas consumers in Pennsylvania and savings of more than $400 million for consumers in New Jersey.\\nDespite the intense opposition of environmental activists, who view the pipeline as a danger to the region, PennEast appears set to secure the necessary regulatory approval to move forward.\\nIn April, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued a favorable\\xa0final environmental impact statement for PennEast that said any potential impact would be “adequately minimized” through mitigation efforts. \\nIn August, the U.S. Senate confirmed the Trump administration’s nominees to the commission, providing the agency with the quorum needed to approve projects such as PennEast.\\nBut Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey Sierra Club, disputes the figures PennEast has circulated that show energy consumers stand to benefit financially from the new infrastructure. Instead, he anticipates the pipeline actually would raise costs.\\n“Individually, these companies [that are part of PennEast] have been seeking rate hikes to pay for the pipelines, because they cost money,” Tittel said. “They have to pay back investors. How does this save people money?”\\nTittel also cited a report from Stephanie Brand, director of the New Jersey Division of Rate Counsel, who has expressed reservations about the pipeline’s cost and utility. The division’s mission is to advocate for energy consumers.\\n“PennEast is dangerous and unnecessary, and the PennEast companies are just trying to make money for themselves. This has nothing to do with consumers and their energy needs,” the Sierra Club leader said. “Natural gas is a commodity, and the price is set by commodity markets, and it’s just not true to say that the pipeline will lower prices.”\\n“The other problem is that the pipeline will pass through environmentally sensitive and scenic areas, and pass through quaint, bucolic little towns that depend on ecotourism. This is also a historic area, where [George] Washington crossed the Delaware. \\n“Now you’re going to have this big, ugly pipeline cutting through, and it’s going to hurt the economy,” Tittel said.\\nThe front of an anti-pipeline flier mailed to New Jersey residents by ReThink Energy, a coalition funded by the William Penn Foundation. (Photo: Kevin Mooney/The Daily Signal)\\n‘Alternatives Are More Expensive’\\nIn the “Frequently Asked Questions” section of its website, PennEast provides readers with detailed answers to questions about the project’s size and scope, potential economic benefits to consumers, environmental safeguards, and restoration efforts that will take place once the pipeline is completed. A separate report from PennEast describes how natural gas development will bring both economic and environmental benefits.\\nPat Kornick, a spokeswoman for PennEast, said “well-funded” anti-pipeline activists who have maintained a constant presence in the public eye and in the media are not looking out for the best interests of the people they claim to represent.\\n“When people question the need for a new pipeline, they are not seeing the big price discrepancies that exist between the New Jersey marketplace and the Pennsylvania portions of the Marcellus, where natural gas is produced,” she said. “Pipelines are the cheapest, most effective way to bring natural gas to market. The alternatives to pipelines, which involve the trucking and transportation of liquefied natural gas, are much more expensive.”\\nThe funding that stands behind the environmental activism directed against natural gas development is evident from the signs littering the roadways in New Jersey, and from mailings delivered to area residents. \\nEvery member of the coalition called ReThink Energy, cited on the opposition materials,\\xa0has received substantial funding from the\\xa0William Penn Foundation, a private, nonprofit charity.\\nGrants the foundation distributed to ReThink Energy members in recent years include $395,000 in 2017 and $582,000 in 2015 to the New Jersey Conservation Foundation, $82,500 in 2016 to the Stony Brook-Millstone Watershed Association, and\\xa0$227,400 in 2016 to the Pinelands Preservation Alliance.\\nTom Shepstone, who operates the Natural Gas Now blog, a product of his research firm based in Honesdale, Pennsylvania, told The Daily Signal that the William Penn Foundation is not permitted to do any lobbying as a private charity. But, he argued,\\xa0 the organization is making an end run around the prohibition by distributing grants to environmental activists and compliant media outlets that do its bidding. \\n“As a private foundation, they shouldn’t be doing any lobbying, but when you think about it that’s all they do at the foundation,” Shepstone said. “When they pass out money year after year to certain groups, they are doing this to influence public policy.”\\nFoundation-Funded News Outlets Defend Coverage\\xa0\\nShepstone said he also sees a connection between the William Penn Foundation and negative press coverage of PennEast. \\nPhiladelphia-based WHYY Inc., which has TV, radio, and digital news operations, has received $660,000 from William Penn for its StateImpact Pennsylvania news service.\\xa0Community Foundation of New Jersey, which supports the NJ Spotlight news service, has received $350,200 from William Penn.\\n“So much of the narrative against PennEast is written by the people who are on the same side as the people spinning the narrative,” Shepstone said. “The groups opposed to the pipeline have a shared funding source in the form of the William Penn Foundation, and you also have StateImpact Pennsylvania and NJ Spotlight, which are funded by the William Penn Foundation. \\n“So, when an environmental group has something negative to say about PennEast, that’s immediately picked up by these two news services to echo it and repeat it. It is so sad to see newspaper reporters not pick up on these blatant conflicts of interest,” he said.\\nLee Keough, editor-in-chief of NJ Spotlight, defended his organization’s coverage in an email Wednesday to The Daily Signal.\\n“We receive financial support from all sides of this issue—utilities, environmental groups, the William Penn Foundation, as well as PennEast itself,” Keough wrote, adding:\\nTake a look at our site today … You may have to reload a few times to see all the ads. Nor do I think we have necessarily taken a critical view of the issue, although we have given it a lot of coverage. That reflects the passion that pipelines engender locally.\\nWHYY, the media company behind the StateImpact Pennsylvania news service, also responded to The Daily Signal’s request for comment.\\n“We strive to present balanced and factual information that takes into account all sides of the pipeline issue,” Sandra Clark, WHYY vice president for news and civic dialogue, said in an email.\\n“As with all of our reporting, no funder dictates our editorial coverage in any way and, as always, we’re sensitive to potential or perceived conflicts of interest. The issues raised about our coverage of the PennEast Pipeline have no basis in fact.”\\nFoundation Mum on Funding\\xa0\\nThe Daily Signal repeatedly invited the William Penn Foundation to comment for this article on its funding of environmental groups and media organizations, and asked what its position is on PennEast. The foundation did not respond.\\nThe Sierra Club Foundation received $300,000 from the William Penn Foundation in 2017 and $250,000 in 2016. But Tittel said his New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club and the Sierra Club Foundation are two separate organizations, and his New Jersey group has not received funding from the foundation. \\nTom Gilbert, campaign director for energy, climate, and natural resources at the New Jersey Conservation Foundation, declined to address his organization’s relationship with the William Penn Foundation, but explained why his group is opposed to the pipeline.\\n“We oppose PennEast because it would have significant impacts on thousands of acres of taxpayer preserved open space and farmland, some of the cleanest streams in the state, and habitat for threatened and endangered species,” Gilbert said in an email to The Daily Signal, adding:\\nFurthermore, energy experts and the N.J. Division of Rate Counsel have concluded that there is no evidence of need for the project, and it would be ‘unfair to ratepayers.’\\nPennEast faces tremendous opposition in New Jersey. Approximately two-thirds of the affected homeowners have refused to grant them survey access or easements. \\xa0Every town in the path of the pipeline opposes it. Thousands of citizens spoke out against it during the FERC [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] process.\\nOne of the signs opposing the PennEast Pipeline that dot a road in Hopewell Township, New Jersey. (Photo: Kevin Mooney/The Daily Signal)\\nReal or Illusory Opposition?\\nThe idea that there is a groundswell of opposition to the pipeline on the part of the public is highly suspect, Shepstone of the Natural Gas Now blog\\xa0told The Daily Signal.\\n“When you see all these signs out there, you have to remember that the funding behind them comes from narrow special interests that do not speak for average citizens and from one rich family at the William Penn Foundation opposed to development,” he said. \\n“The public stands to benefit from the pipeline and from clean, affordable natural gas. These environmental groups are just shills for the William Penn Foundation, and with their echo chamber in the media, it makes the opposition seem bigger than it really is.”\\nAnother key player is the Delaware Riverkeeper Network, a nonprofit based in Bristol, Pennsylvania, which has been a persistent opponent of PennEast since the project was first announced. \\nThe Riverkeeper Network has been sharply critical of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the agency’s positive environmental assessment of PennEast.\\n“There are very serious ramifications from PennEast for people’s health and safety,” Riverkeeper Network President Maya K. van Rossum said. “We are talking about devastation to very important habitats, wetlands, and forests, and increased pollution running off into our waterways, and this runoff contributing to erosion and the loss of habitat.”\\nThe group released its own report on what it calls the economic costs of PennEast.\\n“The damage done by PennEast will far outpace any benefits,” van Rossum said. “The tradeoff is not worth it in terms of lives and livelihoods.”\\nThe William Penn Foundation donated about $1.4 million to the Delaware Riverkeeper Network in 2017 and $914,000 in 2015. But van Rossum dismissed the idea that her organization takes direction from the foundation. \\n“That’s a false argument, a misrepresentation, and a red herring,” she said, adding:\\nWe have multiple funding streams, and foundation funding is but one of them. When you apply for a foundation grant, you propose the work that you are going to do in the public interest, and the funder chooses whether or not to support that work. The funder does not give you money and then dictate what you are to do with it.\\n‘Held Hostage’\\nJordan McGillis is a policy analyst with the Washington-based Institute for Energy Research, a nonprofit that \\xa0supports a free-market approach to energy policy. McGillis is highly critical of the role the Delaware Riverkeeper Network has played through the PennEast approval process.\\n“Despite their proximity to the Marcellus Shale, New Jersey and the rest of the northeastern states pay some of the highest electricity rates in the country,” McGillis said. “The reason is that they’re being held hostage by the ‘keep-it-in-the-ground’ movement. In the case of New Jersey, one of the main culprits is the Delaware Riverkeeper Network and its frivolous lawsuits.”\\nThe energy policy analyst added:\\nThe pernicious effect groups like this have isn’t trivial. Each pipeline delay results in New Jersey residents paying millions of dollars more than is necessary for energy. A study by Concentric Energy Advisors estimated that people in New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania could have saved $900 million in the winter of 2013-2014 had something like the Penneast pipeline been operable.\\nWhen you look at the 990s [IRS tax forms], and you see that groups like the Delaware Riverkeeper aren’t the local, grass-roots movements they purport to be, but rather are funded by megadonors like the William Penn Foundation, it adds to the frustration you feel for the people who bear the costs of the seemingly endless legal delays.\\nShepstone, the Natural Gas Now blogger, told The Daily Signal that the Delaware River Basin Commission’s authority over pipelines “is highly questionable,” and he expects PennEast to go forward.\\nPennEast is working to obtain approval from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and the Delaware River Basin Commission, a federal interstate agency. \\nBut the ultimate authority rests with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

       " '\"It’s a wrong that needs to be righted,\" veteran teacher Jane Ladley says of a teachers union veto of her choice of a charity as an alternative to paying the union. (Photo courtesy of The Fairness Center)\\nTeachers who object to paying union fees on religious grounds are too political, some union leaders in Pennsylvania argue in a new twist on long-standing complaints about organized labor’s involvement in elective politics.\\xa0\\xa0\\nBut at least two of those teachers, who just had their day in court to put state labor laws under scrutiny, see more than a little irony at work in the union complaints.\\xa0\\nLawyers for Jane Ladley, who taught in public schools for 25 years before retiring in 2014 from Avon Grove School District in Chester County, argued her case Dec. 11 before the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania in Harrisburg.\\nJoining Ladley in suing the Pennsylvania State Education Association, a teachers union, was Chris Meier, a history and economics teacher at Penn Manor High School in Lancaster County for the past 10 years.\\xa0\\nNeither teacher is a member of PSEA, but the union secured contractual agreements with their respective school districts that require nonmembers such as Ladley and Meier to pay what the union calls “fair share fees.”\\xa0\\nThis is one of about 80 lawsuits filed across the nation by public employees against labor unions to recover union fees, terminate union membership, halt dues deduction, or challenge exclusive representation, according to the Pennsylvania-based Commonwealth Foundation.\\xa0 \\nPennsylvania law permits teachers such as Ladley and Meier, who object on religious grounds to paying the mandatory union fees and what they fund, to steer money from their paychecks to the charity of their choice rather than the teachers union.\\xa0\\nBut there’s a catch, as David Osborne, an attorney with the Fairness Center, a nonprofit law firm based in Harrisburg, explained in an interview.\\n“For some time, the law has allowed religious objectors to send money to a charity of their choice that’s equal to the amount that would otherwise be sent to the union,” Osborne told The Daily Signal. “But, at the same time, the charity has to be agreed upon between the nonmember and the union.”\\nWhat State Law Does\\nThe way the law works, money is withheld from a public employee’s check and deposited into a separate account while the PSEA, or other union, processes the employee’s selection of a charity. In the case of Ladley and Meier, the PSEA objected to their choices.\\xa0\\nLadley had settled on a scholarship fund for high school seniors who want to study the U.S. Constitution, but the union objected. She then selected the Constitutional Organization of Liberty, which supplies educational information highlighting American history and the ideals of the Constitution.\\nThe teachers union didn’t respond to Ladley’s proposed alternative, according to a press release from the Fairness Center.\\n“They are telling me which groups I have to choose,” Ladley is quoted as saying. “It’s a wrong that needs to be righted. I’m doing this on principle and for the other teachers coming up through the ranks, so that they can have these options available to them.”\\nAs his charity, Meier selected the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, a nonprofit based in Virginia that provides legal assistance to public employees who seek to free themselves from union membership.\\n“I want freedom of choice—to be able to donate to the charity I choose,” Meier said in a statement released by the Fairness Center.\\nSo far, that choice has not materialized.\\xa0\\n“The PSEA refused Chris’s selection on the basis that the [National Right to Work Legal Defense] Foundation provided legal representation to teachers who sued the PSEA,” the Fairness Center said of Meier’s case.\\nAccording to the teachers union, it said, allowing Meier to help fund the foundation “would be a ‘conflict of interest’” for the union.\\nUnion’s Giving to Politicians\\nOsborne, the Fairness Center attorney, also said he was unimpressed with the union’s objections to the selected charity of the other teacher, Ladley.\\n“The PSEA said it would not agree to the selected charities because the union thought they were too political,” Osborne said. “Ms. Ladley thought that was laughable because the PSEA is one of the most political organizations in the whole state.”\\nThe  Pennsylvania State Education Association has more than 181,000 members, including teachers and other education professionals, making it the largest public employee union in the state.\\xa0\\nIn 2018, the union contributed more than $1.5 million to Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, during his successful reelection race. Campaign records also show Wolf was the top recipient of the union’s contributions from 2010 to 2016, receiving $865,000.\\xa0\\nIn the past quarter-century, the union has contributed more than $14 million to Pennsylvania Democrats and a little more than $3 million to Republicans, campaign records show. \\xa0\\nThe Fairness Center represents the plaintiffs in the Ladley case and in a related case, Hartnett v. PSEA.\\nIn the second case, teachers who have chosen not to become union members object to the collection of “fair share fees” as a violation of their First Amendment freedoms. Greg Hartnett, a teacher in the Homer Center School District, is the lead plaintiff.\\nRelated: 1 Year after Union Ruling, Pennsylvania Law Still Allows for Unconstitutional Fees\\nThe Daily Signal asked media relations officials of the Pennsylvania State Education Association for comment on the arguments made by the plaintiffs in the Ladley and Hartnett cases.\\xa0\\nThe Daily Signal also asked the teachers union whether it had concerns that that “fair share fee” requirements included in its contracts are illegal in light of the Supreme Court ruling.\\xa0\\nThe union had not responded at publication time.\\xa0\\nRole of the Supreme Court \\nThe Fairness Center has partnered with the National Right to Work Foundation to represent Hartnett and the other schoolteachers in the second case.\\n“The Hartnett and Ladley cases have become very similar, even though they held different facts at the outset,” Osborne said.\\nThat’s because the Supreme Court struck down mandatory union dues and fees for public sector workers in deciding  the case of  Janus v. AFSCME in June 2018.\\n“What unified the two cases was the Janus decision,” Osborne said. “Janus could change everything. If the court applies Janus and rules to invalidate that part of Pennsylvania labor law that makes fair share fees possible, then that settles both cases.”\\nOsborne also said he sees potential for the Ladley and Hartnett cases to reverberate across state lines.\\xa0\\n“These cases could have an impact in other states, many of which still have agency fee statues on the books,” the teachers’ lawyer said.\\xa0\\nThe funds for the teachers in the Ladley case were initially held in an escrow account while the Janus case was pending before the Supreme Court. But the union refunded the money after the high court decided Janus.\\n“The union tried to moot this case to avoid a ruling on the merits,” Osborne said, adding:\\nFortunately, the court understood the argument we were making and that Pennsylvania law has not been addressed on this point. The PSEA is arguing that the court doesn’t need to rule because the union claims it has already done everything that is required. But the problem is that PSEA’s promises are self-serving and they could change their mind anytime. There’s still a collective bargaining agreement with fair share fees, and the PSEA has done nothing to change this.\\nPushing Back\\nCharles Mitchell, president and CEO of the Commonwealth Foundation, a free-market think tank based in Harrisburg, has followed both cases. In a  press release, Mitchell said the Supreme Court’s Janus ruling is beginning to arouse government workers who have been denied their free speech rights.\\n“More workers are realizing that their union’s leadership is acting for themselves rather than for workers,” Mitchell said. “Our friends and neighbors in public service shouldn’t have to sue to have the same rights as you and I.”\\nThe Fairness Center’s lawsuits against the teachers union in Pennsylvania figure into a larger national picture, according to a new report from the Commonwealth Foundation detailing the legislative and legal response to Janus across the country.\\xa0\\nIn 2019, lawmakers introduced more than 100 Janus-related bills at the state level, the report says.\\xa0\\n“In many states, union leaders are using their considerable lobbying resources to slow legislation that would enforce Janus and to pass union-friendly bills,” Mitchell says in the report.\\xa0\\nBut Pennsylvania is among the states pushing back from the other direction with legislation that would bring state labor laws into compliance with the Supreme Court ruling, the report notes.\\xa0\\nThe report says Pennsylvania and California account for nearly half of the roughly 80 lawsuits filed by public employees against labor unions to recover union fees, terminate union membership, halt dues deduction, or challenge exclusive representation.',\n",
       " 'Parents\\' efforts to reverse \"LGBT education\" measures or prevent their implementation will be an uphill battle. (Photo: Stock/Getty Images)\\nTRENTON, N.J.—Parents are plenty angry about a New Jersey law that requires LGBT material to be incorporated into public school classroom instruction.\\nThe parents say they are concerned the new law will “teach\\nlifestyles and life choices that stand 100% against our family values.” They\\nobject to their tax dollars being used for what they call an “assault on\\nreligious liberty.” \\nAnd they say a special interest group helping develop curriculum for the new requirements has a “radical agenda” that could jeopardize the health and safety of children.\\nOne parent warned about how the “gender ideology” already prevalent\\nin public schools can “brainwash” a child into believing he is a girl rather\\nthan a boy and vice-versa.\\nAs parents found out Jan. 4\\xa0 at a “parental rights” conference in Flemington, New Jersey, elected officials and religious leaders share their concerns. But the effort to reverse these laws or prevent their implementation will be an uphill battle. \\xa0\\nAt the meeting, Victoria Jakelsky, state director of a grassroots\\ngroup called Protect Your Children, or Team PYC, estimated that about 60\\nparental rights activists from Team PYC would be in Trenton Wednesday to\\ntestify against the new law.\\nBut Kathy Goldenberg, president of the New Jersey State\\nBoard of Education, told parents Wednesday that the board was not empowered to make\\nany policy changes with regard to the curriculum focused on lesbian, gay,\\nbisexual, and transgender issues.\\n“The law was enacted by the state Legislature, and it did not\\ngrant the board a policymaking role with this law,” Goldenberg said. “But we\\nare glad to listen to your comments.”\\nAt issue is LGBT education legislation that New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, signed into law Jan. 31, 2019.\\nNew Jersey became the second state in the nation, following California, to pass a law requiring public schools to teach about LGBT history. \\xa0 \\nThe New Jersey measure says the state board of education “shall include instruction on the political, economic and social contribution of persons with disabilities and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people in an appropriate place in the curriculum of middle school and high school students as part of the district’s implementation of the New Jersey Student Learning Standards.”\\nA pilot program designed to accommodate the new curriculum began in 12 public schools as of Jan. 7. \\nAll New Jersey middle and high schools are supposed to be equipped\\nto begin meeting the new requirements this coming fall. \\nThe immediate aim in speaking at the school board hearing Wednesday\\nand in meeting with public officials is to find a way to postpone full\\nimplementation of the program, Jakelsky said.\\n“We want to be clear. We care about each and every child, and we\\nsupport and defend equality,” Jakelsky told The Daily Signal. “We are highly\\nconcerned that the LGBT history will teach lifestyles and life choices that\\nstand 100% against our family values, our deeply held religious views, and the\\nway we practice our faith.”\\nSome parents said they could support an opt-out provision, but\\nJakelsky said she does not think that would be sufficient. \\nAll the groups taking part in the Jan. 4 conference were united in\\nopposition to the new law. Those included “teachers, school board members,\\nOrthodox Jews, Muslims, and Coptic Christians,” said Jakelsky, who lives in Hunterdon\\nCounty.\\nProtect Your Children, she said, has grown to about 1,000 active\\nmembers since being formed at a rally last June. It is affiliated with ParentalRights.org, and includes\\nevangelical Protestants, Roman Catholics, Coptic Christians, and other\\nconcerned citizens, she said. \\nJakelsky said Team PYC also is aligned with Muslim and Jewish\\ngroups that share concerns about the potential dangers the LGBT curriculum\\npresents to students. Team PYC is on\\nFacebook.\\xa0\\nBut some were there Jan. 4 to bring to light similar laws enacted\\nby Murphy and New Jersey’s Democrat-controlled Legislature.\\xa0 \\nCrystal Lopez, who lives in Sussex County, attended on behalf of NewJerseyMama.net, which advocates repeal of a state law that she says prevents licensed therapists from providing individuals afflicted with gender dysphoria from obtaining a “fair and balanced medical assessment.”\\xa0 \\nLopez, who also is active with the Kelsey Coalition, a nationwide group that\\nworks to “promote policies and laws to protect young people who identify as\\ntransgender,” recounted a two-hour phone conversation she had with her son when\\nhe “came out” and said he was transgender. She tells the full story on her website. \\nHer son was 19 and attending Rutgers University at the time, and Lopez\\nasked counselors at Rutgers to help him identify his male biology. But a New\\nJersey law against “conversion therapy” prevented counselors from giving her\\nson the help he needed, Lopez said during her presentation.\\n“Gender ideology has brainwashed my son and erased his childhood,”\\nLopez said. “My son now thinks he is really a girl. The curriculum that is\\nbeing implemented is really harmful and is meant to confuse our children.”\\nOthers focused on Garden State Equality, a group headquartered in Asbury Park that describes itself as a “statewide advocacy and education organization for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community,” and helped establish the curriculum and initiate the pilot program. \\xa0\\nGarden State Equality, which claims 150,000 members and presents details of the LGBT curriculum on its website, is working to advance a “radical agenda” that “undermines the constitutional rights of parents,” Jakelsky said. \\n\\xa0>>> Related: This School District Partners with LGBT Advocacy Group to Impose Transgender Policy\\nThe Daily Signal sought comment from Garden State Equality for\\nthis report, but the group did not respond before publication. \\nThomas Sobol, of Flemington, took issue with what he called an\\nassault on personal freedom. \\nThe LGBT agenda is “wrong, wrong, wrong for public schools,” Sobol told The Daily Signal. “This agenda should not be forced on people and I don’t think that it’s age appropriate to have this in public schools. Public education should be neutral, and it’s unfair to exclude people with religious values. This agenda did not come out of nowhere.”\\nMayor Ed McKelvey, a Republican from Alloway Township in Salem\\nCounty and an ordained pastor who has attracted media attention for\\nspeaking out against the LGBT curriculum, said it is a matter of right and\\nwrong.\\n“God never calls you to do something that does not line up with\\nhis word, even if what he calls you to do doesn’t always make natural sense,”\\nMcKelvey told audience members.\\nPat Stanley, a member of the Franklin Township School\\nBoard in Somerset County, warned Team PYC members that too many\\ngovernment officials “have a mindset that says your kids are theirs.”\\nShe said the law firm Strauss Esmay Associates, based\\nin Toms River, “greases the skids” for the LGBT curriculum to be implemented in\\nthe state. Stanley estimates that it costs schools about $13,000 a year to work\\nwith Strauss Esmay and that the firm has about 500 clients.\\n“You are the teachers of your children, not the government,” Stanley\\nsaid. “This is an assault on the rights of parents. We should not have to\\nprotect our children against this nonsense. We already have kids who can’t read\\nor do math, and now they are being burdened with this undue influence.”\\nThe Daily Signal sought comment from Strauss Esmay, but the law firm\\ndid not respond after acknowledging the inquiry. \\nMayor Alfonso Cirulli of Barnegat Township in Ocean County called on\\nChristians from across denominations to unite in an effort to reform New Jersey\\nlaws that undermine biblical teachings. \\nCirulli, a Republican, has been widely quoted for saying\\nthat the LGBT curriculum mandates could “indoctrinate” students.\\n\\xa0“This is a spiritual battle,” he said. “We have the Lord\\nbehind us.”\\nCirulli, a former assistant school principal, told the audience Jan.\\n4 that the letter “P” for pedophilia could be added to the LGBT acronym. \\nCirulli said he sees a “full-scale assault” against Christian values at work in television commercials, public libraries, the toy industry, and other venues.\\xa0\\nPastor Steve Nash from LOFT Wesleyan Church in Hillsborough suggested\\nparents may need to start pulling children out of public schools.\\xa0\\n“There is a battle for the souls of our children and our nation,”\\nNash said in his talk, adding:\\nThey are trying to propagate their views onto innocent children. As Christians, we see homosexuality as a matter of rebellion against God because it undermines the creation of God. This is being done to undermine the institution of the family. As parents, we have an awesome responsibility to raise kids because they are a gift from God.\\nA dozen members of Team PYC are scheduled to meet Jan. 30 with Lamont Repollet, New Jersey’s commissioner of education.\\nGroup members also plan to testify at school boards across the state in February and March, and to hold “prayer and policy meetings” in some counties.',\n",
       " '“I asked them if it was OK to take this piece of land and grow wheat and they all said it was OK,” Jack LaPant recalls of  government officials he consulted. (Photo: Pacific Legal Foundation)\\nNo one told Jack LaPant that he could be in violation of the Clean Water Act for farming his own land.\\nThat’s mostly because the federal law includes a clear exemption for “normal” farming activities. But it’s also because the government officials LaPant consulted didn’t view overturned dirt that has been tilled and plowed as pollution.\\nIn 2016, the Army Corps of Engineers, which administers the Clean Water Act with the Environmental Protection Agency, began legal action against LaPant for plowing he did in 2011 to plant wheat on a ranch property he owned in Northern California.\\xa0\\nBut in March 2012, LaPant had sold the property, located in Tehama County about 4 miles south of the city of Red Bluff.\\nBefore plowing his field to plant wheat, LaPant conferred in person with the Farm Service Agency in California, which is part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\\xa0\\n“All of these government officials I spoke with, and they have all been deposed, they never once suggested that I should go meet with the Army Corps of Engineers,” LaPant said in a phone interview with The Daily Signal.\\xa0\\n“I asked them if it was OK to take this piece of land and grow wheat and they all said it was OK,” he recalled. “Even today, you can go into these offices and they will not tell a farmer that he needs to go and see the Army Corps to farm on his own land. It makes no sense and the Department of Agriculture doesn’t understand any of it, and we are talking about the same federal government.”\\nLaPant recalls visiting “four different government folks” with expertise in soil conservation when he was researching the history of the farm.\\n“They all gave me the same answer,” LaPant said. “They told me, ‘Jack, if you’d like to go ahead and plant it the same way it’s been planted in the past, go ahead. But if you want to go in and plant a permanent crop, then maybe we’ll go back and study it.’ So, I went ahead and planted 900 acres of wheat.”\\nThe legal complications for LaPant began after he sold the property to Duarte Nursery, a family-owned nursery operation based in Tehama County, California, which then encountered similar problems with the Army Corps of Engineers.\\xa0\\nDuarte Nursery entered into a settlement agreement with the federal government after suing the Army Corps of Engineers for denying due process. Pacific Legal Foundation, a nonprofit, public interest law firm based in Sacramento, California, and Washington, D.C., represented the nursery in the case and now represents LaPant.\\nTony Francois, a lawyer with Pacific Legal Foundation who specializes in property rights, told The Daily Signal that the orchard-planting operations of another company, Goose Pond Ag, may be what led to the prosecution of LaPant.\\xa0\\nGoose Pond Ag, a Florida-based farmland management company, purchased a portion of the California property from Duarte Nursery in 2012. Six years later, in 2018, the company reached a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department in which it agreed to pay $5.3 million in civil penalties for Clean Water Act violations, according to media reports.\\n“It’s the orchard planting and the preparations for the orchard planting, which involves fairly substantial earthwork, that really got the Army’s attention and got this whole enforcement action going,” Francois said. “What’s odd about it is that they roped LaPant into it, and we think the Army may have initially thought LaPant was part of this plan to plant the orchard.”\\nThis month, Pacific Legal Foundation plans to submit a motion for summary judgment to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California that could resolve some or all of LaPant’s case based on “application of the law to the undisputed facts in the case,” Francois said.\\nIf the case is not resolved,\\xa0 it could move to a jury trial sometime in 2020.\\nThe Daily Signal sought comment from the Army Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency. Neither agency had responded by publication time.\\xa0\\nWhat’s particularly alarming to LaPant and other farmers familiar with his case is that in their view the Corps saw fit to modify the Clean Water Act without congressional approval, Francois said.\\n“There’s a pretty broad, clear statement in the Clean Water Act that you don’t need a permit for normal farming activities,” Francois said, adding:\\nThis would include normal ranching, farming, forestry activities. But the Army has added multiple conditions that you have to meet for these protections [for such operations] to continue.\\nOne of these conditions is that the property has to be tilled pretty regularly for this protection to continue. But there are many reasons why a farmer may suspend tilling. For example, cattle may have a higher price than wheat or corn, and so the land might be used for grazing for a period of time.\\xa0\\nThe Army has definitely added hurdles and obstacles to a pretty clear and simple statement of the Clean Water Act that you don’t need a permit for normal farming activities. In our view, what they’ve done is to change the policy decision Congress made.',\n",
       " 'Francisco Molina, a former shop steward, ran into a problem when he resigned from SEIU Local 668 and demanded that the union stop deducting dues from his paycheck as a social services aide. (Photo: The Fairness Center)\\nFrancisco Molina got a refund check from his former union compensating him for dues collected after he resigned his membership.\\nThis means that the money Molina earned on the job since that time can’t be used to finance union political activity he doesn’t support.\\nBut what about the dues he paid as a social services aide for Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, prior to resigning from the union? This question remains unresolved.\\nThat’s because a Pennsylvania law makes it possible for labor unions to collect dues from government workers who decide they no longer want to be union members.\\xa0\\nMolina, who was a shop steward for Service Employees International Union Local 668, ran into difficulty a little more than a year ago when he resigned from the union.\\xa0\\nHe told SEIU officials to stop collecting dues from his paycheck.\\xa0\\nWhat happens next in his case, and others raising similar legal questions, could have ramifications across the country. Millions of dollars, perhaps tens of millions, in union dues and fees are at stake, according to legal filings.\\xa0\\nRelated: He Tried to Quit His Union. The Law Didn’t Let Him, and He Lost His Government Job Instead.\\nMolina has said he resigned from SEIU membership because his “personal values never matched the union’s.”\\xa0\\nGoing After Refunds \\nLiberty Justice Center, a nonprofit, public interest law firm based in Chicago, has joined with National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, a nonprofit legal advocacy group in Springfield, Virginia, to seek refunds of union fees that government employees claim were collected from them illegally.\\xa0\\nThese cases are active in Pennsylvania, New York, Maryland, and Illinois. In the Maryland case, Liberty Justice Center estimates that almost 10,000 state employees “could recoup up to $7 million that the union took from them.”\\xa0\\nIn a related case out of Pennsylvania, Liberty Justice Center estimates that about 2,000 employees “could recoup as much as $1 million in illegal union fees they paid between 2017 and 2018.”\\nAlthough Molina’s case is “unique among others’ cases seeking retrospective relief,” his lawyer said in an interview, Molina’s free speech arguments could reverberate across state lines if a federal court in Pennsylvania decides the union should refund dues he paid before resigning his membership.\\xa0\\xa0\\nMolina argues that he and other government employees were denied due process because the union didn’t apprise them of their First Amendment rights.\\xa0\\nAs The Daily Signal previously reported, the SEIU rejected Molina’s resignation letter dated July 16, 2018, saying he had to remain a union member under Pennsylvania’s “maintenance of membership” law, which applied to his contract.\\xa0\\nMolina continued to protest, but Lehigh County dismissed him from his government job as a social services aide in the Office of Children and Youth Services on Aug. 14, 2018, a few weeks after he resigned from the union.\\nUnion Strategy\\nMolina filed a lawsuit in January against SEIU Local 668, challenging the union’s refusal to allow him to resign his membership and claiming it violated his constitutional rights under the First and 14th amendments.\\xa0\\nThe Fairness Center, a nonprofit, public interest law firm based in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, represents Molina in the case filed with the U.S. District Court of the Middle District of Pennsylvania.\\nIn July, Judge Yvette Kane dismissed portions of Molina’s complaint in an opinion that said the former shop steward’s pursuit of “retrospective monetary relief” is “moot” because the SEIU did agree to refund the dues he paid since his resignation from the union.\\xa0\\nMolina also appeared to lack standing, Kane said, because he no longer was a union member when he filed the case. The judge was appointed in 1998 by President Bill Clinton.\\nMolina’s lawyer declined to reveal the amount of dues or fees involved in his case.\\xa0\\n“SEIU officials are implementing a strategy to avoid court rulings on constitutional issues because they know they would lose,” David Osborne, a lawyer with The Fairness Center, told The Daily Signal in an interview.\\xa0\\n“The judge in this case found in favor of the union and said the fact that [Molina] had gotten his money back means either he doesn’t have standing or the case is moot. These important claims have been dismissed, but the case is still active.”\\n\\nBecause the union “cried uncle” before the court addressed the substantive question of the constitutionality of the “maintenance of membership” provision of\\xa0 Pennsylvania’s Public Employe Relations Act, Osborne said, the law will remain on the books for the time being.\\nWhat the Supreme Court Said\\nUnder the disputed provision, public employees may resign union membership only during a 15-day window before their contracts expire. Public sector unions such as the SEIU stipulate that members must submit a resignation letter by certified mail within that 15-day window.\\nBut for Molina, and other public employees across the nation, the Supreme Court’s ruling in June 2018 in the case of Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees turned out to be a game-changer because it struck down mandatory dues and fees imposed by unions for government employees.\\xa0\\nLiberty Justice Center and National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation represented Mark Janus, an Illinois state employee who objected to AFSCME’s political activities, in his case before the Supreme Court.\\nMolina told The Daily Signal in an interview that the Supreme Court ruling in favor of Janus provided him with the impetus to resign from the SEIU.\\xa0\\nAlthough the federal court dismissed Molina’s complaint seeking dues collected since he resigned from the union, his case remains active because the judge said she is willing to entertain his complaint seeking refund of “preresignation dues,” and to consider the possibility that he didn’t get due process.\\n“It’s not the end of the case for a couple of reasons,” The Fairness Center’s Osborne said. “Molina raised due process arguments because he believes he was not properly informed of his rights, and he has also made a claim seeking dues going back for two years based on the fact that he believes the membership card he signed was invalid. So, his case is not dead.”\\nIn the meantime, SEIU Local 668 appears to have dropped the “maintenance of membership” requirement in its new collective bargaining agreement for state employees over concerns that the state’s legal provision is unconstitutional.\\nThe Daily Signal sought comment from SEIU 668 on the latest developments. The union had not responded by publication time.\\nNational Impact\\n“Francisco [Molina] believes he’s entitled to a return of pre-Janus dues in part because the SEIU itself recognized that the membership card he signed prior to Janus was invalid,” Osborne said. “So Francisco could make a national impact with his case, but I’d describe the impact as establishing a foothold—not necessarily a right—for any other public employees who want to recover pre-Janus dues payments.”\\nWhile Molina and other government employees in Pennsylvania press their cases in court, some state lawmakers have introduced proposed changes to state law that would strike “maintenance of membership” requirements as unconstitutional in light of the high court’s Janus ruling.\\nState Rep. Kate Klunk, a York County Republican, introduced a measure (HB 785) that would require government employers to notify workers of their rights. State Rep. Greg Rothman, a Cumberland County Republican, introduced a bill (HB 506) to allow government employees to resign from a union anytime they like, without a window to do so or any other restrictions.\\nCommonwealth Foundation, a free-market think tank based in Harrisburg, released a new report that includes an online interactive database detailing public sector labor laws in all 50 states.\\n“The Janus decision was a watershed moment for workers’ rights, but our report shows that a lot of heavy lifting still needs to be done to ensure the ruling is enforced,” Charles Mitchell, president and CEO of Commonwealth Foundation, told The Daily Signal in an interview, adding:\\nSince Pennsylvania is not a right-to-work state, it stands out as one of the states most impacted by the decision. But our ‘maintenance of membership’ law represents a loophole allowing union leaders to keep public employees locked into paying dues and supporting political positions at odds with their own.\\xa0\\nThankfully, Pennsylvania lawmakers are proposing to do away with resignation restrictions. Other states, especially those friendly to worker freedom, should seize on the Janus ruling as an opportunity to update their own statutes. Union leaders will continue calling in political favors from their allies in government. We can’t let them undermine the workers’ constitutional rights.',\n",

Because of the site’s “complexity and size,” the report says, a cleanup that goes back to 1984 will take several more years to complete.\\nThe work includes “plugging” abandoned wells and excavating contaminated soil in Ottawa County, Oklahoma. State and federal officials first became aware of potential environmental hazards in 1979, when water began rising to the surface from underground mines.\\xa0\\nThe EPA has joined with the state of Oklahoma and the Quapaw tribe of Native Americans in a yearlong effort to formulate a “strategic plan” for Tar Creek after it was added to the agency’s Emphasis List. The strategic plan, which will be released later this month, assesses cleanup needs, risks, and economic potential for the site.\\n“The work of the Superfund Task Force over the past two years is paying dividends for communities nationwide, including those near the Tar Creek Superfund site,” Regional Administrator Ken McQueen said in a press release.\\xa0\\n“EPA will continue working with our partners toward a cleanup that will benefit the surrounding communities,” McQueen said.\\nThe full Superfund Task Force report, released earlier this month, is available here.\\nEPA officials say they will continue to update the Emphasis List on a quarterly basis.\\nRelated:\\xa0 Trump’s EPA Outpaces Obama in Cleaning Up Hazardous Waste Sites\\nThe Superfund program dates to 1980, when Congress passed the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act.

He said his state’s pilot program involving ranchers and farmers helped to rehabilitate the species.\\n“We were seeing the sage grouse numbers go up and growing,” Tipton said. “This ought to be our goal, not [to] have them listed [as endangered] in perpetuity.”\\nTipton and other lawmakers present took the opportunity to roll out a draft package of bills designed to “modernize” the Endangered Species Act.\\xa0\\nTipton already has introduced a bill (HR 6344) to encourage voluntary conservation efforts at the local level.\\n\\xa0>>> Related: Lawyers Make Millions Off Taxpayers, Endangered Species Act as Ranchers Try to Live With Rare Bird\\nBen Goldey, communications director for Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., chairman of the Western Caucus, told The Daily Signal that the caucus is still in the process of building support from “stakeholders” and potential co-sponsors of the new bills.\\nOnce the bills are introduced formally, the caucus will press for hearings and votes, Goldey said.\\nRep.

Currently, that agency, part of the Interior Department, shares responsibility with the National Marine Fisheries Service, part of the Commerce Department.\\nThe draft package of legislation includes 18 other related bills.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe problems with the Endangered Species Act flow not just from its language but its implementation, Daren Bakst, a senior research fellow with The Heritage Foundation, said during his presentation.\\nIn 2012, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service found that 1,500 acres in Louisiana should be designated as critical habitat for a species known as the dusky gopher frog, Bakst said, citing one example.\\xa0\\nJust one problem, he said: The frog had not been seen in Louisiana for more than 50 years. But because of the “critical habitat” designation, the federal government sought to impose a ban on development that would deprive property owners of more than $30 million in value, the Heritage policy analyst told attendees.\\n“So, what was the point of this effort?” Bakst asked. “It didn’t serve the interests of the dusky gopher frog, but there are plenty of losers in this effort, including the property owners plus other threatened and endangered species.”\\nOther listed species lost out, he said, because resources that could have been allocated elsewhere were diverted to an area where the species in question wasn’t even present.\\xa0\\nThe example of the dusky gopher frog highlights what Bakst described as “two central problems” with the Endangered Species Act.\\n“One, the Endangered Species Act doesn’t focus resources where they can be most effective,” he said. “And, two, the law attacks property owners, when the best approach would be to recognize that property owners are integral to preserving species.”\\nKaren Budd-Falen, the Interior Department’s deputy solicitor for fish, wildlife, and parks, briefed other roundtable participants about the Trump administration’s efforts to reform the law.\\n“While the administration is committed to protecting threatened or endangered species, that should not be an excuse to hold up a project, to hold up decisions, to hold up ideas, and to hold up things that may actually help species,” Budd-Falen said. “So, we are trying to have specific time frames and keep activities to those time frames. The Department of Interior is not yet done with regulatory changes.”\\nIn August, the Trump administration rolled out a new set of rules that officials said were designed to improve implementation of the Endangered Species Act.\\xa0\\nThe new rules clarify the distinction between “threatened” and “endangered” species, and set higher standards for unoccupied areas to be designated as critical habitat. Before federal officials declare a critical habitat, the area must contain one or more physical or biological features essential to conserving the species.\\n>>> Related: Trump Rule Aims to Streamline Protection of Endangered Species\\nMyron Ebell, director of the Center for Energy and Environment at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian think tank in Washington, told lawmakers he sees cause for encouragement in\\xa0the Trump administration’s reforms and the package of legislation crafted to modernize the Endangered Species Act.\\xa0\\nEbell noted that a research paper published last year by the Competitive Enterprise Institute, “’Whatever the Cost’ of the Endangered Species Act, It’s Huge,” offers suggested policy changes to improve the transparency and accountability of listings under law and designations of\\xa0critical habitat.\\n“Our motto at CEI has been the ESA is bad for wildlife because it’s often bad for people,” Ebell said. “The reason is because the costs of dealing with endangered species and protecting habitat and recovery are often borne by private landowners.”\\nEbell said Congress should authorize “a comprehensive audit” of the costs of the law and pass legislation that compensates property owners for “regulatory takings.” (His complete comments are available here.)\\nKathleen Sgamma, president of the Western Energy Alliance, told elected officials that the more than 300 oil and natural gas companies belonging to the trade association are devoted to conservation, but that the Endangered Species Act is skewed against them.\\n“Our members are happy to go above and beyond to protect species,” Sgamma said. “But not when the Endangered Species Act is weaponized to stop oil and natural gas development. In the West, the Endangered Species Act is used to control land, not primarily to recover species.”\\nJonathan Wood, a lawyer with Pacific Legal\\xa0Foundation, a nonprofit, public interest law firm headquartered in Sacramento, California, expressed support for the draft package of legislation. Until now, the Endangered Species Act has been beset with perverse incentives that need to be changed, he said.\\xa0\\n“One of the most important lessons we’ve learned is that although the law works for preventing the extinction of species, it does not work at promoting recovery,” Wood said. “And the reason for that is the most important factor for recovering species is creating incentives for the private landowner to protect and restore habitat, and we simply don’t do that.”\\n“I’m glad to see many of the bills that are part of this package aimed at reducing that conflict while providing those better incentives,” he said, adding:\\nIn fact, one of the\\xa0focus areas I see in the bills is to codify administrative practices developed by Republican and Democratic administrations to make the law work better. That codification is particularly important because it heads off the risk of litigation. Perhaps the biggest effect of the ESA has been to incentivize litigation. As an environmental attorney, I appreciate the work, but in the long run we are not doing well by the species we all care about.\\xa0As part of that codification process, I think it’s important to codify the recent rules adopted by the Trump administration.\\nThe lawmakers expect opposition on Capitol Hill to the legislative package outlined Tuesday by Western Caucus members.\\xa0\\nRep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz., warned that her Democratic colleagues are advancing an alternative version of reform that she said would “hurt industries, and quite frankly hurt America” if they ever became law.\\nBrian Seasholes, executive director of the Southwestern Communities Coalition, testified Tuesday before a House Natural Resources subcommittee, cautioning policymakers to avoid changes to the Endangered Species Act that would impose high costs on landowners without achieving any conservation benefit.\\xa0\\nIn his opening statement at the roundtable, Gosar, chairman of the caucus, criticized House Democrats for currying favor with environmental activists.\\n“Our roundtable with real people impacted by ESA listings is a nice contrast to the hearing currently being held by the Natural Resources Democrats that seeks to move the country backwards by repealing three news regulations just implemented by the Trump administration,” Gosar said.\\xa0\\n“The Democrats’ two main witnesses are from Earthjustice and Defenders of Wildlife, left-wing environmental groups that are more interested in filing frivolous litigation in order to prop up their extremist organizations than they are in doing constructive things that actually help species,” the Arizona Republican said.\\nThe Daily Signal sought comment on Gosar’s characterization from Earthjustice and Defenders of Wildlife.

He credited Trump for delivering on his pledge to provide the American people with regulatory relief.\\n“File this under promises kept,” Howell said. “The Trump administration today provided regulatory certainty to landowners across the country and undid one of the most egregious power grabs of the Obama administration.”\\nNot everyone was pleased with the Trump administration’s actions, however. The Natural Resources Defense Council, a New York City-based nonprofit environmental advocacy group, had issued a press release in anticipation of Thursday’s announcement.\\xa0\\nJon Devine, director of federal water policy at the council, said that the rule change would lead to environmental degradation.\\xa0\\n“The Clean Water Rule represented solid science and smart public policy. Where it has been enforced, it has protected important waterways and wetlands, providing certainty to all stakeholders,” he said, adding: \\nThe Trump administration’s wild-eyed attempts to reward polluters, however, knows no bounds, so it is repealing these important protections without regard for the law or sound science.\\xa0\\nThis unsubstantiated action is illegal and will certainly be challenged in court.\\nBut David Fisher, president of the New York Farm Bureau, supports the rule change. He credits the Trump administration for striking a balance between environmental protection and economic opportunity.\\xa0\\n“Farmers share the goal of protecting the nation’s water, but the 2015 Waters of the United States rule was unreasonable and unworkable,” he said at Thursday’s press event in Washington, adding: \\nIt made protecting water quality and conservation efforts more difficult and created huge liabilities for farmers, especially when what waters would be regulated under the old rule could not be clearly defined.\\xa0\\nThis turned farming into a guessing game on which land use required federal permits and what did not. \\nNew York Farm Bureau appreciates the EPA’s diligent effort to repeal and clarify the WOTUS rule to ensure a fair and reasonable substitute that protects our water and our ability to work and care for the land.\",\n",

       " '\"While I was able to resign my union membership, I was still required to pay a union fee as \\'fair share\\' for union representation,\" writes Greg Hartnett. Pictured above: Teachers with the ASPIRA charter school network in Chicago hold a rally on March 17, 2017. (Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images)\\n\\nGreg Hartnett\\n\\nGreg Hartnett is a teacher from Homer-Center School District in Pennsylvania and the plaintiff in Hartnett v. Pennsylvania State Education Association.\\nOne year ago, the Supreme Court\\nruled that public-sector employees like me, who are not union members, don’t\\nhave to pay union fees in order to be employed. \\nThat ruling is already benefiting me and countless others. But unfortunately, Pennsylvania law hasn’t caught up with the times.\\nFor decades, teacher contracts often required even non-union employees to pay fees to a union or lose our jobs—regardless of whether we agreed with the union’s positions. But because of the Supreme Court’s 2018 ruling in Janus v. AFSCME, Council 31, those forced union fees are now unconstitutional.\\nThe ruling was of particular\\ninterest to me because in 2017, I, too, filed\\na lawsuit seeking relief from this unconstitutional practice. \\nDuring my 20 years as a public school teacher, I was compelled to send a portion of each paycheck to the teachers union, even though I did not agree with how the union leaders represented me during various negotiations. They blatantly ignored my opinions and worked to maintain their own power. \\nWhile I was able to resign my union membership, I was still required to pay a union fee as “fair share” for union representation—representation I did not ask for, want, or need. \\nIn my lawsuit, I joined with three other Pennsylvania teachers to challenge these forced union fees in court.\\nAs my case waited in a lower court, the Supreme Court’s decision in Janus answered the question we were asking: Can teachers—or any public-sector employee—be compelled to fund union activities, many of which are political in nature? \\nThe answer was simple: No. Doing so violates employees’ guaranteed rights to free speech and association.\\nDespite the court’s ruling, many of my colleagues remain unaware of their new freedom to not pay. Most haven’t heard of the Janus ruling, and union leaders aren’t telling them about it. \\nAs a result, many teachers continue to fund union activities they disagree with, unaware that they have another choice—resign from the union and pay nothing.\\nTo make matters even more confusing, Pennsylvania state law still authorizes forced union fees for public-sector employee contracts, which it calls “fair share” fees. \\nWhile Janus should apply to Pennsylvania law—many union officials have publicly admitted as much—the Supreme Court’s decision did not specifically analyze Pennsylvania law and nullify any of its provisions. \\nThat means any teacher trying to\\nunderstand their rights would soon encounter a valid state law and, in many\\ncases, a contract with their employer requiring that non-members pay fees. \\nIn fact, the Pennsylvania State Education Association and some of its local unions are continuing to include fair share provisions for non-union members in some of their new contracts right now—even after Janus. \\nAs absurd as it sounds, they are completely ignoring the Supreme Court’s ruling and are knowingly negotiating for unconstitutional provisions in employment contracts. \\nThis is why my own case, Hartnett v. PSEA is still relevant. It’s why we are now appealing to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\\nMy case is about bringing the Janus ruling to Pennsylvania and affirming public-sector employees’ rights at the state level. Specifically, we are asking the courts to declare state fair share provisions unconstitutional and block teachers unions from including them in future contracts. \\nWhile one court has ruled that the Janus decision doesn’t require this, the facts, as noted above, prove otherwise. And a recent court ruling in California indicates there are legal grounds for my continued appeal. \\nI take great pride in my work as\\na teacher to thousands of Pennsylvania students. It’s an honor to have the\\nconfidence of both the parents and administrators in Indiana County’s\\nHomer-Center School District where I teach. \\nIt’s been a full year since the Janus decision was handed down, and I believe that workers across the country are benefiting.

(Photo: Hopewell Valley Central High School website)\\nHOPEWELL, N.J.—Freshmen football players, changing\\xa0in their high school locker room at the beginning of\\xa0the school year, were startled to encounter a girl\\xa0who said she identifies as a boy.\\nThe \\xa0father of one of the players wrote to the school’s principal and athletic director to express concern about the “young lady” and the “comfort” of the boys, most of whom were 14 at the time and “wondering what was going on.”\\n“I think you are doing a disservice to the kids by not having at least a casual conversation with them regarding their comfort in the locker as well as treating others with the same respect they want while changing clothes,” the player’s father said in an email to Tana Smith, principal at Hopewell Valley Central High School, and Tripp Becker, the athletic director.\\nThe father\\xa0asked whether the high school’s football coach and district administrators had planned to provide the team with a “heads up” about the school district’s new transgender policy, adopted three months earlier by the Hopewell Valley Regional Board of Education, and were ready to\\xa0field questions or concerns.\\nThe answer was no.\\nDavid Machin, coach of Hopewell Valley’s freshman football team, emailed team parents Sept. 20, 2016, to say there would be no public announcement clarifying school rules on gender. Machin wrote team parents:\\nI believe the district policy (which follows federal law) is that any student may use whatever locker room/bathroom that he/she identifies with. I believe that there is no requirement for a public announcement regarding this type of situation or even a ‘heads up,’ so to speak.\\nThe athletics logo and mascot of the Bulldogs. (Photo: Hopewell Valley Central High School website )\\nThe reason for the silence, Hopewell parents who spoke with The Daily Signal said, is that a LGBT advocacy group appears to exercise significant influence on school board members and administrators in the Hopewell Valley Regional School District, especially Superintendent Thomas Smith.\\nGarden State Equality, headquartered in Asbury Park, New Jersey, describes itself as “a statewide advocacy and education organization for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community.”\\nThe Hopewell Valley school board adopted the transgender policy June 20, 2016, one year ago Tuesday.\\nThe action came five weeks after the Obama administration warned local school districts to\\xa0spell out transgender students’ access to the rest room and locker room facilities of their choice, or risk\\xa0loss of federal dollars.\\nFour days after the school board vote, Garden State Equality tweeted a message featuring a photo of its executive director,\\xa0Christian Fuscarino (at left) with “friends” from the Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network:\\nWith our friends from @GLSENCentralNJ at the Department of Education talking about #safeschools @GLSEN @Fuscarino pic.twitter.com/IjEi7XqFxx\\n— GardenStateEquality (@GSEquality) June 24, 2016\\n\\nThe incident in Hopewell Valley Central High’s locker room occurred just a few days after the 2016-2017 school year opened. It set off a chain of email communications, copies of which The Daily Signal has obtained through New Jersey’s Open Public Records Act.\\nParents across the state should be concerned about how much influence Garden State Equality exerts over “key decision-makers” in local school districts at the expense of sound policy, Len Deo, executive director of the New Jersey Family Policy Council, told The Daily Signal in an interview.\\nWhile opposing sides should be heard in public forums, Deo said, he sees a danger that some transgender policies will infringe free speech:\\nSome of these policies have gender identity pronoun requirements, and we have to ask what the ramifications are if someone does not comply for reasons of conscience. Who is the authority and what are the ramifications? What does this mean for free speech? If a school district suddenly says that gender is fluid and it’s one thing today and another tomorrow, this leads to all kinds of confusion and different interpretations.\\nLen Deo, executive director of the New Jersey Family Policy Council, in 2013. (Photo: Facebook)\\nWhile it’s fine to accept input from advocacy groups, the onus is on school board members and superintendents to look out for the public interest instead of advancing narrow special interests, Deo told The Daily Signal\\n“Let’s not forget who is paying the taxes for these school districts,” he said, adding:\\nThe parents are paying the taxes and they deserve to be heard instead of being silenced. I think one difference between us and Garden State Equality is we are not trying to manipulate school boards and superintendents. We are trying to give parents a voice.\\nThe Hopewell Valley district serves about 4,000 students from preschool through 12th grade in suburban Mercer County about 10 miles south of Princeton.\\nThe Hopewell Valley player’s father, who asked not to be identified, says he decided to press his point because taxpayers should be heard.\\n“I also went to meet with the principal and the athletic director to express my concerns,” the father\\xa0said in an interview with The Daily Signal.\\n“They insisted this student was not actually changing in the locker room, and I told them that they were wrong, because all of the kids told me otherwise. Instead of having an intelligent conversation where we can all address the concerns of students and parents, they just want to stonewall.”\\nHe added:\\nI’ve coached baseball for 14 years now, and I’m someone who understands kids. We are talking about something that’s occurring during their formative years, and it’s understandable that they would have questions. Honestly, I think they’ve been a lot more mature about this than our own school administrators, who are pushing their own policy agenda. [The administrators] seem to only be concerned with making one student comfortable in a locker room and not the rest. But I think there are ways to make everyone comfortable.\\nThis photo of a rainbow is featured on the home page of the Hopewell Valley Regional School District. (Photo: hvrsd.org)\\nSchool Board Veteran Challenges Policy\\nHopewell Valley’s nine-member school board approved the policy on “Transgender and Gender Nonconforming Students” at its regular meeting one year ago, on June 20, 2016.\\nSchool Board President Lisa Wolff joined six other members to OK the policy, while one member abstained and another was absent. The vote occurred little more than a month after the Obama administration mandated such policies\\xa0for schools that wanted to keep getting federal dollars.\\nThe Hopewell Valley policy says students are responsible for determining their own gender identity, except \\xa0“in the case of young students not yet able to advocate for themselves”—and then a parent or guardian will make that determination. The policy doesn’t specify any ages.\\nSo long as administrators determine that a student is sincere, the school should accept that student’s “asserted gender identity,” the policy says.\\nWerner Graf, a former school board member with two daughters in the school system, was the only resident who showed up at the meeting last June to speak out against the transgender policy and the manner in which the system implemented it.\\n“I took the three minutes the board allotted me to make points about legal liability, privacy, and safety, and suggested the policy be sent back to a larger committee for review,” Graf recalled in an interview with The Daily Signal. \\xa0“It wasn’t a radical request, especially since the debate thus far was apparently void of any input from concerned parents.”\\nDuring time set aside for public comment, Graf warned the school board of the “bad optics” of the LGBT advocacy group’s involvement, \\xa0given that the school board is supposed to be nonpartisan:\\nYou’ve allowed this Garden State Equality group to come in, and Garden State Equality is clearly a partisan organization. They are a self-described advocacy group for a set of people.\\nThe board gave Garden State Equality “preferential treatment” that “sets a very bad precedent” for how public policy decisions are made in the school district, Graf added.\\nWerner Graf, who unsuccessfully opposed how the school board adopted a transgender policy, has two daughters in the Hopewell Valley school system. (Photo: Werner Graf)\\nA Receptive Audience \\xa0\\nAn analysis of email records obtained by The Daily Signal in a request under New Jersey’s Open Public Records Act shows Garden State Equality began burrowing in as a policymaking entity for the Hopewell Valley school district just over two years ago, in March 2015.\\nThe emails show Lee Rosenfield, who sits on the board of Garden State Equality and has two children in the school district, invited Smith to join him at a fundraising “cocktail party” in Lambertville, New Jersey, for the LGBT advocacy group.\\nRosenfield also invited the school superintendent to meet with Andrea Bowen, then the group’s executive director, so she could explain “new plans to combat ongoing bullying, discrimination, and insensitivity in New Jersey’s schools.”\\nAlthough he said he couldn’t attend, Smith apparently remained receptive to input from the LGBT group over the next several months. In a Sept. 28, 2015, email to Aaron Potenza, director of programs for Garden State Equality, the superintendent asked whether Potenza would like to attend a “leadership team” meeting.\\n“I would be honored if you would join one of our leadership team meetings to participate in a discussion about current issues facing students today,” Smith wrote. “We are a pretty informal group and we really enjoy learning from leaders in the field of education.”\\nSmith was responding to Potenza’s email to superintendents across the state, which sought their participation in an LGBT “needs assessment” program.\\nMost New Jersey school districts, including Hopewell Valley, subscribe to a state-based education policy consulting service, Strauss Esmay Associates, which has circulated its own transgender policy recommendations.\\nIn an email Oct. 2, 2015, to school superintendents, Potenza explained why Garden State Equality objected to Strauss Esmay’s model policy. He said those recommendations fell short because they gave too much latitude to parents and school officials to determine a student’s gender identity:\\nStrauss Esmay’s policy contains confusing and potentially harmful language that bases students’ rights on whether they are seen as conforming to masculine or feminine stereotypes associated with their gender identity. Schools should not be in the business of policing students’ gender presentation.\\nPotenza concluded by inviting Smith and other superintendents to “work with” Garden State Equality “to help create better policy.”\\nGarden State Equality recommends its own transgender policy for schools and a guidance document interpreting state and federal laws. Little daylight appears between what the Hopewell Valley school board adopted and what the LGBT group proposed.\\nAs of 2016, the group estimates, 25 of the 584 operating school districts in New Jersey had moved to implement policies spelling out the rights of transgender students.\\nGarden State Equality “provided training and consultation on LGBT students to over 50 school districts in New Jersey” in 2015 and 2016, according to the records obtained by The Daily Signal.\\nFuscarino, the group’s\\xa0executive director since April 2016, said he views Hopewell Valley’s transgender school policy, and similar policies throughout the state, as a success.\\n“We’ve had nothing but positive feedback from individuals who worked with school districts regarding our policy,” Fuscarino said in an interview Friday. “We do this work because we want a safe environment for all students.”\\nSuperintendent Thomas Smith, left, and school board President Lisa Wolff, right, are key players in a transgender policy for New Jersey’s Hopewell Valley school district.

(Photo: hvrsd.org)\\nSmith Opposes Another State’s Law\\nAt the behest of Garden State Equality in a court case, Smith, the Hopewell Valley superintendent, joined an amicus brief opposing North Carolina’s so-called bathroom bill, commonly known as HB 2.\\nThe legislation, which North Carolina lawmakers passed in March 2016, prohibited transgender individuals from using restroom facilities in government buildings that did not correspond with the gender on their birth certificate.\\nSmith quickly signed on to what became known as the “school administrators’ brief” in cooperation with the San Diego-based law firm of Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP.\\nOn May 24, 2016, Potenza emailed Smith to introduce the Hopewell Valley superintendent to Asaf Orr, who specialized in transgender youth as a staff lawyer at the National Center for Lesbian Rights, which was working with allied groups to put together the amicus brief.\\n“Put me down! I will sign,” Smith wrote in response that same day.\\nIn a May 26, 2016, email exchange with Wolff, the school board president, Smith discussed the amicus brief and said: “Clearly I won’t ever be able to work in North Carolina.”\\nAs it turns out, Smith was the only school superintendent in New Jersey to sign on to the amicus brief, and he explained why in his email to Wolff:\\nActually I am representing the state. They only wanted one from New Jersey. Apparently they want N.J. because of our governor.\\nGov. Chris Christie, a Republican in his second term, was a candidate for president last year and threw his support to Donald Trump after dropping out of the race.\\nGarden State Equality’s Potenza wrote:\\nThe focus of the brief is using the stories of administrators who have implemented trans-inclusive policies to show the court that all of the claims being made by the state [of North Carolina] about ‘common sense’ and the like is actually nonsense and pretext for discrimination.\\nBut at the time Smith agreed to sign the legal brief, his own school district did not officially have a “trans-inclusive” policy in place. That came a few weeks later.\\n‘Fearmongering’ and ‘Hatemongering’\\nIn a video of the June 2016 school board meeting\\xa0linked below, Graf and other speakers begin their remarks at the 26-minute mark.\\n“As I understand the policy, having read it, a child can go into a locker room or bathroom based on the gender that they identify with,” Graf, the former board member, said. “However, that is subject to some [administrative] overview. If you deny one child and allow another, I don’t see how the board can put itself in that position without potentially having a lawsuit on its hands.”\\n\\nGraf added that the policy could jeopardize students, especially girls, who are put in a position where they must undress in close proximity to males who say they identify as females. Girls, he said, should not be forced to expose themselves in such a situation:\\nYou are opening up [to others] a safe space for the ladies that I don’t think has to be opened up. There are ways to do this in a way that doesn’t force kids into the bathroom that they are uncomfortable with, but at the same time doesn’t put their rights as something that supersedes other people’s rights.\\nGraf encouraged board members to carefully consider potential problems that might arise involving staff members, such as janitors, who are considerably older than students. Under the policy, a male janitor who identifies as a woman couldn’t be told to stay out of a girls’ locker room, he warned.\\nRosenfield, the board member of Garden State Equality who spearheaded the LGBT group’s outreach to the school district, followed Graf’s remarks with comments supporting the transgender policy.\\nHe denounced Graf’s concerns and request for further review as “hatemongering” and “fearmongering,” turning toward Graf repeatedly during his time at the microphone.\\nWhen Graf objected to this characterization, Wolff quickly cut him off, saying he already had his time for public comment.\\n“He was talking to us,” the school board president scolded Graf, referring to Rosenfield. “He might have looked at you. This is public comment. You do not get a second chance to talk. I didn’t hear any comments directed at you. We don’t have dialogues with members of the public.”\\nGraf told The Daily Signal:\\nThis ‘hatemongering’ narrative is a typical bullying tactic which erodes civil debate on important issues. The superintendent and board are under the illusion that they are marching across a bridge in Selma. They’re not. All they are doing is reducing the safety, comfort, and privacy of the kids in our district, especially our girls. They’ve also set an extremely bad precedent by letting a political activist group essentially write the policy for them.\\nThe black-clad Hopewell Valley Bulldogs in action. (Photo: Mike Schultz/Hopewell Valley Central High School)\\nRosenfield figures prominently in the emails obtained by The Daily Signal under the state’s Open Public Records Act.\\n“In my view you are a rock star, Tom,” \\xa0the LGBT activist said in an March 18, 2015, email to the superintendent. “I am so impressed with everything you do.”\\nRosenfield repeated the “rock star” compliment in a Sept. 1, 2016, email to Smith, who emailed back to thank Rosenfield for the connection with Garden State Equality.\\n“I was asked to sign an amicus brief as part of the lawsuit [in North Carolina] regarding transgender equity,” Smith wrote. “I am the only New Jersey superintendent asked and I was proud to sign my name.”\\nThe superintendent dismissed Graf’s concerns expressed during the public meeting several months earlier, emailing Rosenfield:\\nWe do go to outside groups. That’s not unique here. But it’s up to us how we take that feedback. We are pretty darn objective and not swayed by any particular organization.\\nBut if the superintendent is objective, why was he swayed to join an amicus brief in a court fight and take sides in a national debate over transgender policies extending beyond schools?\\nWolff, the school board president, declined to answer that question from The Daily Signal in an email response. \\xa0But she did defend Hopewell Valley’s transgender policy, saying it formalized practices already in place:\\nSince the policy basically documented what our district was already doing, the policy implementation did not require sweeping changes. Not surprisingly, now almost one year since the policy was adopted, I am aware of no student complaints or issues.\\nThe transgender policy made media headlines when it was originally passed and I received questions in the months that followed, but other than a few letters of support from people simply confirming that we had a policy on the books, there have been no further concerns raised.\\nThe Daily Signal also invited comment from the superintendent, the freshman football coach, and Garden State Equality officials, including Potenza and Rosenfield.\\nTo date, only Garden State Equality’s executive director, Fuscarino, has responded.\\n‘Very Bipartisan’\\nGarden State Equality has not concealed its Democratic Party leanings.\\nThe LGBT advocacy group actively campaigned against two Republican incumbents in Congress, Reps. Scott Garrett and Chris Smith, during the 2016 election cycle. In press releases and media statements, it described both congressmen as “repulsive,” “bigoted,” and “homophobic” proponents of “hate.”\\nCampaign finance records show Garden State Equality has funneled almost $50,000 to the Democratic Party and its candidates since 2007, and almost none to Republicans.\\nThe organization draws substantial donations from left-leaning foundations inside and outside New Jersey, including $10,000 from Tides, an organization\\xa0financed in part by hedge fund manager George Soros. With allied groups such as its education fund, Garden State Equality has received nearly $3 million from these foundations since 2005, according to the Washington-based Capital Research Center.\\nBut Fuscarino said the donations in prior years weighted toward Democrats, and the donations from liberal foundations, occurred before he became executive director and “are not reflective of the current leadership.”\\n“We used to have a political action committee and we don’t have a political action committee anymore,” he said. “We don’t make those kinds of donations anymore. We have been very bipartisan in our efforts more recently.”\\nFuscarino added:\\nWe are living in a time now when there is more support for LGBT causes on both sides of the aisle. All of the Republicans, except for two, were supportive of LGBT causes to a certain degree, so we endorsed them.\\nLGBT advocates, including Fuscarino (second from left in this tweeted photo), took part in an annual Equality March\\xa0along the boardwalk in Asbury Park two days before the Hopewell Valley school board’s vote:\\n1000+ walking for LGBT equality and justice in @GSEquality Walk. #WeAreOrlando @Fuscarino pic.twitter.com/9W2JlPlF6M\\n— Matthew McMorrow (@MTMcMorrow) June 18, 2016\\n\\nLatitude\\nThe Daily Signal may not have received all \\xa0documents from the Hopewell Valley school district that are responsive to its request under the Open Public Records Act.\\nIn a letter, Robert Colavita, the school district’s business administrator and board secretary, said the district isn’t required to read through all potentially relevant documents.\\n“While we are required to search for documents, we are not required to read documents to determine whether they are responsive to the OPRA request,” Colavita wrote, referring to the Open Public Records Act. “This would constitute research not required under OPRA.”\\nAs for the father who first registered concern about the locker room at Hopewell Valley Central High School where unsuspecting freshman football players came across a transgender student?

       " 'Francisco Molina, a former shop steward, ran into a problem when he resigned from SEIU Local 668 last summer and demanded that the union in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, stop deducting dues from his paycheck. (Photo: The Fairness Center)\\nFrancisco Molina, a social worker for more than 12 years in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, grew dissatisfied with his government employee union and tried to resign from it last summer rather than continue to pay dues. State law wouldn’t let him leave the union, and taking a stand cost him his job.\\nAlthough he used to be a shop steward for Service Employees International Union Local 668 and lobbied on the union’s behalf in both Harrisburg and Washington, Molina says, he had decided to break with the SEIU in response to actions he viewed as hostile to free speech rights. \\nMolina, who was a social services aide in the Lehigh County Office of Children and Youth Services,  says he also discovered that fellow union leaders did not provide rank-and-file members with accurate information.\\n“When I joined the union, I didn’t agree with their principles or values,” Molina, 52, told The Daily Signal in an interview. “But I wanted to make a difference with myself and my co-workers, and I felt that if I got involved, I could make some changes from within as a shop steward.”\\n“But my personal values never matched the union’s,” Molina said. “The further I got up the chain of command, I realized it was all an illusion and that what they were presenting to the rank and file was not true.”\\nWhen SEIU Local 668 asked Molina and co-workers to sign a new membership card in January 2018, he balked after carefully reviewing the language on the card. \\nMolina, who has three daughters with his wife of 32 years, says he refused to sign because he would be obligated to pay dues regardless of his membership status.\\n“Even if I wanted to go work for someone else, the union would have the ability to take money straight from my personal account if I had signed,” he told The Daily Signal.\\nSEIU Local 668 declined to comment for this report.\\n‘A Pre-Emptive Campaign’\\nIt’s not just that leaders of public sector unions in Pennsylvania are reluctant to allow Molina and other members to resign, but that a state law locks in government employees to pay union dues against their will.\\nNow a federal court could rule that unconstitutional, or state legislators could amend the law to secure free speech rights. \\nA section of state law specifies that public employees may resign union membership only during a 15-day window before their contracts expire.\\nPublic sector unions such as the Service Employees International Union stipulate that Molina and other members must submit a resignation letter by certified mail within that 15-day window. \\nBut this “maintenance of membership” provision of Pennsylvania’s Public Employees Relations Act 195 doesn’t require unions to inform workers of the resignation window. And the state’s public payroll systems automatically deduct union dues from paychecks until employees, including Molina, find a way to unwind themselves from membership. \\nEven then, government workers who choose not to belong to unions have been required to pay “fair share” fees to keep their jobs.\\nWhat this means for Pennsylvania civil servants such as Molina—who differ with union leaders on a range of policy questions—is that they must spend part of their work day paying for political activism by the union that they don’t support.  \\n\\n“They had this emergency mandatory meeting in January [2018], where they said the old [membership] cards were invalid and we had to sign new ones,” Molina said of Local 668. “What they were doing was a pre-emptive campaign to avoid the legal ramifications of an unfavorable ruling in the Janus case.”\\nIn that case, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June 2018 that “agency shop” laws requiring nonunion government workers to pay union fees violate the First Amendment rights of those who object to the political agenda of the union.\\nJustice Samuel Alito, author of the court’s opinion in Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, cited the First Amendment’s guarantees of freedom of speech and freedom of association in his ruling. \\nAlito made the point that individuals are not just free to speak, but also free to “refrain from speaking” and to “eschew association for expressive purposes.” \\nThe labor laws at issue in the Janus case violate the “constitutional command” protecting citizens against government coercion, Alito argued: “Compelling individuals to mouth support for views they find objectionable violates that cardinal constitutional command, and in most contexts, any such effort would be universally condemned.”\\nLawmakers Respond\\nRep. Greg Rothman, a Republican state lawmaker from Pennsylvania’s Cumberland County, introduced a bill to amend the law to allow government employees to resign from a union anytime they like, without a window to do so or any other restrictions.\\n“The public sector unions in Pennsylvania are extremely political, and collectively they are probably the biggest spender on political campaigns in the state,” Rothman said in a phone interview, adding:\\nThey take political positions, which may not in a lot of cases represent the political views of their workers. Part of the First Amendment isn’t just about what I can say, but what someone says on my behalf, and you shouldn’t have your money going towards opinions that aren’t your own. You should also have a right to resign from an organization that doesn’t reflect your views, and you should not be required to be part of an organization in order to have a job.\\nRothman’s bill, HB 506, is one of several that seek to turn the Supreme Court’s Janus ruling into law by amending existing Pennsylvania statutes.\\nState Rep. Kate Klunk, a York County Republican, introduced a measure, HB 785, that would require public sector employers to notify workers of their rights.\\n“The notice requirement is very simple and the onus is all on the public sector employer—be it the school district, municipality, or state government—to inform nonunion members that they are not required to make a payment to the union unless they affirmatively consent to do so,” Klunk told The Daily Signal in a phone interview. \\n“The unions have no express duty in any of these notices, as it’s only the employer that’s required to send out these notices. This is not pro-union or anti-union. This is just about telling employees what their rights are.”\\nAs an attorney, Klunk has expressed concern that Pennsylvania will continue to face costly litigation until state laws are changed to conform with the Supreme Court ruling that struck down mandatory union dues.\\nPennsylvania at Epicenter \\nThe Janus ruling provided Molina with the opening he had sought to make a clean break. \\nIn letter dated July 16, 2018, Molina resigned from SEIU Local 668. Although he wanted to quit the union before the high court’s decision, he knew he would have been compelled to pay “fair share” fees as a nonmember. \\nIn his letter, Molina informed the SEIU that he wanted the deductions of dues to stop immediately. But they didn’t.\\n“Even after the Janus ruling, they continued to take dues out of my paycheck,” Molina said of the union. “According to their definition, after I resigned, I would been a nonunion member. There were others who resigned, but I was the most outspoken. I encouraged other workers to read the new cards carefully.”\\nThe SEIU rejected Molina’s resignation letter, arguing that he had to remain a member under the “maintenance of membership” provision that applies to his contract. \\nMolina continued to protest, and was dismissed from his Lehigh County government job last summer, a few weeks after resigning from the union. Before 2004, he had worked in the private sector but didn’t belong to a union. \\nIn January, Molina filed a lawsuit against SEIU Local 668, challenging the union’s refusal to allow him to resign and alleging that the union violated his constitutional rights under the First and 14th amendments. \\n“Under my contract, it says if I don’t pay my dues, the union can ask for my termination,” Molina told The Daily Signal. “That’s what I believe ended up happening in the end. I was terminated. I cannot work as a civil servant again for the state of Pennsylvania until this case is resolved.” \\nThe Fairness Center, a nonprofit, public interest law firm based in Harrisburg, represents Molina.\\n“What Francisco [Molina] did for himself here was wonderful because he refused to sign a card that would have locked him into paying union dues regardless of his membership,” said David Osborne, president and general counsel of the Fairness Center. “He read the language and decided it didn’t make sense for him. So, what this case is about is a statute in Pennsylvania called ‘maintenance of membership’ that gives unions the right to keep members from resigning for years at a time.”\\nThe Legal Landscape\\nThe Fairness Center filed a separate but related class action lawsuit against Local 668 on behalf of public employees, challenging the “maintenance of membership” law on constitutional grounds. Both cases fit into a larger national picture.\\nThe Daily Signal sought a response from SEIU Local 668 on the specifics of  this article. The union responded to the request, but declined to comment.\\nTwo other organizations—Liberty Justice Center, a nonprofit, public interest law center based in Illinois, and the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation—also entered the fray in Pennsylvania to challenge the legality of the continued deduction of union dues that have cost government workers thousands of dollars.\\nThis was a significant development because the two legal advocacy groups partnered to represent Mark Janus, a child support specialist for Illinois state government, in the Supreme Court case that overturned mandatory union dues for government workers. \\nLiberty Justice Center has filed two lawsuits, one in Lebanon County on behalf of four mental health workers, and another in Philadelphia on behalf of a caseworker for the state’s Department of Health and Human Services. \\nBoth of the center’s lawsuits cite the high court’s ruling in Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees in arguing against the deduction of unions dues on First Amendment grounds. Both cases also challenge the unions’ current standing as the exclusive representative of the government workers who sued.\\n>>> Related: \\xa0Supreme Court Strikes Down Mandatory Union Fees for Government Employees\\nFor its part, National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation took up the case of a school bus driver in the Wallingford-Swarthmore School District who is asking for a refund of union fees that were withdrawn from his paycheck after he resigned his union membership. \\nThe foundation filed suit against Teamsters Local 312 and the school district on behalf of the bus driver, who resigned from the Teamsters after the Janus ruling. The foundation also set up a website called MyJanusRights.org.\\n‘A Real Pushback’\\nThe lead plaintiff in the Janus suit has some advice for unions that he shared with The Daily Signal.\\n“The public sector unions have been spending money on litigation, fighting the Janus decision and fighting workers that are resigning,” Janus said in an email. “Wouldn’t that money be better spent on representing their membership in matters that would better provide for the unions’ original purpose?”\\nJanus added:\\nIt is cumbersome to resign from public sector unions. Now there is a real pushback by the public sector unions to prevent workers from leaving, in spite of the Janus ruling. What they are doing is denying these workers their First Amendment rights.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Fairness Center continues to cut its own path with active Janus-related litigation against AFSCME Council 89 and AFSCME Council 13, both in Pennsylvania.\\nAnother active case that could have reverberations across Pennsylvania concerns a liquor store clerk, John Kabler, who alleges that Local 1776 of the United Food and Commercial Workers gave him false information and misled him into joining the union. Kabler also claims union leaders resisted his efforts to resign, and in March the center filed suit against the union on his behalf.\\nThe public interest firm also settled some Pennsylvania cases in which the union agreed to allow their client to resign without paying more union dues. But these settlements were reached before the constitutionality of the “maintenance of membership” statute faced judicial scrutiny.\\nCharles Mitchell, president and CEO of the Commonwealth Foundation, a free market think tank based in Harrisburg, said he thinks he knows why.\\n“There’s a reason why unions like AFSCME and SEIU are relying upon maintenance of membership rules and the window periods in Pennsylvania,” Mitchell said in a phone interview. “It’s because it’s the next obvious piece of coercion available to them.”\\n“I think it’s very clear that these restrictions are not consistent with workers’ rights and with the First Amendment,” he said. “I also believe one of the many people in Pennsylvania challenging these restrictions will be successful. The Janus opinion is extremely important, and Mark Janus is a hero.”\\nWhile the Fairness Center continues to apply pressure in court, Mitchell sees another ace in the hole available to proponents of labor reform in the form of the new legislative proposals.\\n“There are many lawmakers who are now standing up and saying our laws are inconsistent with the Janus decision and we need to fix them and inform workers of their rights,” he said. “They are doing this despite all the money and influence available to public sector unions, and that’s a very positive development.”\\nKlunk, the Republican lawmaker from York County, would like to see her bill become law this year. Although Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, has received political support from organized labor, Klunk says she is hopeful the governor will allow the bill to move forward.\\nEven if Wolf doesn’t the sign the measure, it could become law without his signature if it passes both houses of the Pennsylvania General Assembly.\\n“Right now, we are clogging up our courts with additional cases over an issue that has already has been settled at the federal level before the Supreme Court,” Klunk said. “This benefits no one, and my bill in its current form repeals an unconstitutional provision of our state law. Wolf is the governor of all the people, not just the unions, and he could sign the bill or choose not to sign it and let it become law.”\\nThe Daily Signal contacted Wolf’s office by phone seeking comment for this story and emailed his press secretary, J.J. Abbott, asking whether the governor has a position on the legislative proposals to amend Act 195. \\nThe Daily Signal also asked Abbott whether the governor had any concerns about the costs of litigation attached to a labor issue that already had been settled at the federal level.

Pictured: Demonstrators congregate outside Feb. 26 as the justices hear the case.  (Photo: Kevin Mooney/The Daily Signal) \\nThe Supreme Court ruled 5-4 Wednesday that nonunion government workers can’t be forced to pay dues or other fees to support a union, further diminishing the power of organized labor and setting up what right-to-work proponents called the “hard work” of protecting free speech rights for the nation’s government employees.\\nRight-to-work advocates also expressed concern about what they see as ongoing conflicts of interest between public employee unions and the government officials whom those same unions help elect into positions of influence over union contracts negotiated at taxpayer expense.\\nIn their decision\\xa0in Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, the justices said “agency shop” laws requiring nonunion government workers to pay union fees violate the First Amendment rights of workers who object to the political agenda of public employee unions.\\n“Compelling individuals to mouth support for views they find objectionable violates that cardinal constitutional command, and in most contexts, any such effort would be universally condemned,” wrote Justice Samuel Alito, author of the court’s opinion.\\nAlito was joined in the majority by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, and Anthony Kennedy. Dissenting were Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Stephen Breyer, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\\nThe Supreme Court ruling overturns its 1977 decision that said public-sector employees may be required to pay “fair-share fees,” also known as agency fees, if they decline to join a union.\\nThe Janus ruling affects about 5 million government employees in 22 states who no longer will be required either to join a union or pay related fees as a condition of employment.\\nMark Janus,\\xa0 a child support specialist at the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services, was the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit.\\n“This case was one of the most important cases in decades for the freedom of speech and freedom of association,” Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner, a Republican, told The Daily Signal in a phone interview days before the decision. “This case is also about the battle against conflicts of interest and corruption.”\\n“Unions are making campaign contributions to elected officials, getting them into office and then they are negotiating their contracts with these same officials. In the private sector, you would go to jail for this kind of activity,” Rauner said.\\nThe high court ruled that employees must affirmatively consent before a union may withhold fees from their paychecks, meaning the system must be “opt in,” not “opt out.” In addressing this point, Alito wrote:\\nUnder Illinois law, if a public-sector collective bargaining agreement includes an agency-fee provision and the union certifies to the employer the amount of the fee, that amount is automatically deducted from the nonmember’s wages. No form of employee consent is required. This procedure violates the First Amendment and cannot continue.\\nNeither an agency fee nor any other payment to the union may be deducted from a nonmember’s wages, nor may any other attempt be made to collect such a payment, unless the employee affirmatively consents to pay. By agreeing to pay, nonmembers are waiving their First Amendment rights, and such a waiver cannot be presumed.\\n‘Hard Work Really Begins’\\nRoberta Lynch, executive director of the local AFSCME Council 31, condemned the ruling in a formal statement:\\nThis case is a blatant political attack by Bruce Rauner and other wealthy interests on the freedom of working people to form strong unions. We are extremely disappointed the Supreme Court has taken the side of the powerful few, but we’re more determined than ever to keep our union strong, standing up for public services and the working people who provide them.\\nWhile pleased with the outcome, Matt Patterson, state field director for the California Policy Center, a nonprofit educational organization, says he doesn’t want advocates of worker freedom to become complacent while unions mobilize efforts to negate the ruling with the assistance of their allies in government.\\n“Now is when the real hard work really begins,” Patterson told The Daily Signal. “We need to hit the ground running so all of these workers can be educated and informed about their rights and what it means for them. Chief Justice John Roberts is not going to go door-to-door in Illinois and in other states telling government workers that they can now opt out from paying union fees.”\\nPatterson said the California Policy Center is poised to lead an effort to educate government employees in California about their rights.\\nThe conflicts of interest between unions and government officials that Rauner and others identify provide union operatives with certain advantages that right-to-work advocates don’t have, Patterson said.\\n“Unions already have a group of dedicated, well-paid activists working tirelessly on their behalf,” he said, adding:\\nThey’re called elected officials, and they will stop at nothing to advance the interests of organized labor at the expense of the taxpayer. To add insult to injury, they are funded by the taxpayer—in other words, you and me.\\nPublic unions have operated like racketeering syndicates for decades—the Janus decision has the potential to bust that system up like some RICO statute from heaven.\\nRICO refers to a 1970 federal law, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Lawmakers initially passed it with an eye toward prosecuting Mafia figures, it is now applied more broadly against all organized crime.\\nAFSCME officials who had been named as defendants in the Janus case argued that government workers who decline to join a union should still be required to pay fair-share fees to support collective bargaining efforts.\\nThese fees are used to help negotiate salaries and benefits for both union and nonunion workers, AFSCME lawyers explained in their brief to the high court.\\nIn response to concerns about the free speech rights of government employees who are opposed to unions’ political activism, the lawyers for AFSCME told the court that the law already permits those employees to “opt out” from paying fees in support of political activities.\\nIllinois government employee Mark Janus, right, lead plaintiff in Janus v. AFSCME, stands outside the Supreme Court with\\xa0 lawyer Jacob Huebert of the Liberty Justice Center. (Photo: Jeff Malet Photography/Newscom)\\nUnions as ‘Inherently Political’\\n\\xa0\\nThe union argument did not carry the day at the Supreme Court because the lines between collective bargaining and political activism have become blurred in recent years, Vincent Vernuccio, a senior fellow with the Mackinac Center for Public Policy in Michigan, said in an interview.\\n“The court has finally come to see that everything public employee unions do is inherently political,” Vernuccio told The Daily Signal, adding:\\nWe are not just talking about direct donations to candidates. When unions are negotiating for higher salaries and more benefits, those are taxpayer dollars we are talking about, and the decision to raise salaries and benefits at taxpayer expense is a policy choice that not everyone shares. At the heart of the Janus case is the idea that government unions are purely political.\\nRebecca Friedrichs, an elementary school teacher who worked for 28 years in the Savanna School District in Anaheim, California, was the lead plaintiff in a case before the Supreme Court in 2016 that raised the same First Amendment argument against mandatory union fees.\\nBut unlike Janus, the Friedrichs case explicitly asked the court to strike down “opt-out schemes” that government employees must navigate their way through to avoid subsidizing a union’s political activities.\\nFriedrichs submitted a friend-of-the-court brief in the Janus case, arguing in favor of a system that would enable workers to opt in rather than opt out of paying union fees.\\nThe court “should make clear that government employers and unions must obtain workers’ affirmative consent before deducting any union dues or fees from their wages,” Friedrichs said in her brief. “This would prevent the use of ‘opt-out’ schemes, which many public-sector unions have used for years to undermine workers’ right to withhold funding for some union political causes.”\\nThe high court ended up doing just this, ending the need for the other cases pressing for “opt in” arrangements.\\nFriedrichs had joined nine other teachers and the Christian Educators Association International to sue the California Teachers Association, several local unions, and the National Education Association.\\nBut because Justice Antonin Scalia died about a month after oral arguments were held in the Friedrichs case on Jan. 11, 2016, the high court wound up deadlocking 4-4. That left a lower court ruling in place that upheld California’s “agency shop” law.\\n>> Related: Union ‘Opt-Out’ Measures Could Dilute Supreme Court Ruling, Teachers Worry\\nEagle Scout Answers the Call\\nJust a few weeks after he was sworn in as governor of Illinois in January 2015, Rauner moved against union mandates in the public sector.\\nThe Republican governor issued an executive order to prohibit collection of union fees from state government employees who are not union members. He also filed a federal lawsuit challenging collection of the fees as a violation of free speech.\\nAlthough a federal district judge ruled in 2016 that Rauner did not have standing since the governor was not part of a union and did not pay union dues or fees, the court permitted other state employees who weren’t union members to intervene and continue the litigation.\\nJanus, who earned the Eagle rank as a Boy Scout, answered the call. The child support specialist in the Illinois health care and family services agency became the lead plaintiff in the case that eventually reached the Supreme Court.\\nThe Janus case challenged the constitutionality of state and local laws requiring government workers to pay fair-share fees to unions as a condition of employment.\\nThe National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation joined with the Illinois-based Liberty Justice Center, a nonprofit public interest law firm, to represent Janus in the case. It named the American Federation of State County, County and Municipal Employees Council 31 in Illinois as the defendant.\\nAFSCME 31 “exclusively represents over 35,000 state employees who work in dozens of agencies, departments, boards, and commissions subject to the authority of Illinois’s governor,” according to court filings.\\nThe Supreme Court’s ruling in favor of Janus overturns the 1977 decision in Abood v. Detroit Board of Education that said public-sector employees may be required to pay the fair-share fees if they decline to join a union.\\nIn Abood, the justices had concluded that those who don’t join a union should not be permitted to operate as “free riders” who benefit from collective bargaining done on their behalf, and therefore should pay union fees. But the Abood ruling also said nonunion employees should not be forced to pay for political activism they do not support.\\nLawyers representing Janus cited a series of recent decisions where the justices expressed rising skepticism toward the constitutionality of Abood while signaling willingness to issue a broad ruling in defense of First Amendment freedoms in the labor sector.\\nIn his opinion for the majority, Alito wrote:\\nWe recognize that the loss of payments from nonmembers may cause unions to experience unpleasant transition costs in the short term, and may require unions to make adjustments in order to attract and retain members.\\nBut we must weigh these disadvantages against the considerable windfall that unions have received under Abood for the past 41 years. It is hard to estimate how many billions of dollars have been taken from nonmembers and transferred to public-sector unions in violation of the First Amendment. Those unconstitutional exactions cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely.\\nAs for those 5 million government employees in 22 states who no longer will be required to join a union or pay related fees? Patterson, the California Policy Center field director, points to educational outreach efforts in Washington state as a model for what needs to be done at the local level across the country.\\nMany home-based health care workers, for example, were unaware that they no longer had to pay union dues as the result of another Supreme Court ruling, Harris v. Quinn. \\nThe Service Employees International Union, known as SEIU, teamed with government officials to prevent employees from exercising their rights until they were informed by an outreach organized through the Freedom Foundation, a nonprofit think tank, Patterson said.\\n>>> Related: Freedom Foundation Drains Union Membership Rolls by Promoting First Amendment\\n“We really don’t know yet what the full impact of the Janus ruling will be,” Patterson told The Daily Signal. “If every public worker in American knows of their rights and how to exercise them, then this could be a cataclysm for public employee unions.”\\n“But of course, unions and their allies in the Democratic Party will do everything they can to block knowledge of these rights and the ability of workers to access these rights,” he said.\\nWith union mandates outlawed in the public sector, attention now moves to a case out of Lincolnshire, Illinois, that is before the 7th U.S. Circuit Court Appeals. In it, union leaders challenge a local right-to-work ordinance prohibiting private-sector employers from entering into agreements that make union membership and payment of dues a condition of employment.\\nRauner, a former private equity executive who is seeking re-election in November, said he supports the ordinance and anticipates that the case ultimately will work its way up to the Supreme Court.\\n“Why should one county or one city have their economic competitiveness determined by the decisions of another county or city?” the governor said. “If local officials wants free choice for their workers and not forced unionization, they should be able to make this choice.”\\n>>> Related: How Local Right-to-Work Battles Could Land at Supreme Court\\nWhile local right-to-work initiatives have taken root in four counties in New Mexico, they have stalled in Delaware where the state General Assembly passed a bill earlier this month invalidating an ordinance\\xa0passed by the town of Seaford.\\nThis report has been updated with new details.\",\n",

(Photo: Bill Clark/Roll Call/Newscom)\\nUnion leaders in Washington state who plotted to undermine a U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturning mandatory union dues are now seeing the other end of that boot in the form of free speech activism and diminished membership.\\n“What a favorable Supreme Court ruling really means is that our work is just beginning,” @FreedomFdtn’s Brian Minnich says.\\nIt’s illegal to force individuals who provide health care services in private homes to pay union dues.\\nBut the powerful Service Employees International Union partnered with compliant government officials to prevent the caregivers from understanding their First Amendment rights, according to the Freedom Foundation, a nonprofit think tank headquartered in Olympia, Washington.\\nMore than 20,000 union members opted to leave SEIU affiliates in Washington state and Oregon, however, after an aggressive outreach involving door-to-door canvassing, targeted mailings, phone calls, and television commercials.\\nThe Freedom Foundation’s Brian Minnich told The Daily Signal that payroll data obtained from the state of Oregon indicate 11,399 out of 28,667 home care providers no longer paid dues to the SEIU affiliate there. That’s a drop of almost 40 percent.\\nIn Washington state, payroll data from April, the latest available, show 9,100 former members of SEIU and the Washington Federation of State Employees no longer paid dues.\\nBeginning in November 2014, the Freedom Foundation hired and trained dozens of canvassers to educate home-based health care aides about their constitutional rights, as affirmed in that year’s Supreme Court ruling Harris v. Quinn, Minnich said in an interview with The Daily Signal.\\nThe high court ruled that unions such as SEIU, which represent “quasi-public employees,” may collect dues only when they are offered voluntarily.\\nSince these workers are considered public employees only for the purposes of collective bargaining, government agencies and the courts do not view them as full-fledged public employees.\\n“We are an action tank, not just a think tank, and our strategy has been to inform SEIU members of their free speech rights and to let them know they have certain rights, including the right to not join a union and pay dues,” said Minnich, executive vice president of the Freedom Foundation, adding:\\nThis effort has been very successful and remains ongoing. In the past year alone, we have cost the SEIU union [in Washington state] more than $10 million. We’ve been able to calculate this figure based on the number of people we know who have left the union, and what this has cost the union in terms of lost revenue from dues.\\nThere is also the amount of money the union has spent on legal fees. Their legal fees have been huge because they are fighting us, and that’s money that they can’t spend on politics.\\nIn 2016, policy analysts at the Freedom Foundation estimate, the SEIU in Washington state spent nearly $1 million on private law firms, an amount largely devoted to litigation against the foundation.\\nSince the only state payroll data the foundation has for Oregon is from May, they say, it is difficult to quantify how much SEIU 503, based in Salem, Oregon, has lost in union dues since the Supreme Court’s Harris v. Quinn ruling.\\nBut Maxford Nelsen, the Freedom Foundation’s director of labor policy, offered an educated guess.\\n“My math shows that SEIU 503 lost about $400,000 in dues in May alone,” Nelsen said. “That means they’re on the path to losing about $4.8 million per year.”\\nNo Comment From Union\\nThe Daily Signal sought comment more than 10 days ago from the SEIU affiliates in Washington state and Oregon on their litigation and other disputes with the foundation. They had not responded by publication deadline.\\nThe individual care providers who have left SEIU include home-based health care aides who receive Medicaid payments in exchange for services to needy and disabled individuals, who typically are family members. They also include child care providers paid by the state to serve low-income families\\nThe Freedom Foundation initiated its outreach efforts in November 2014 with direct mail, email, and phone calls focused on the 7,000 child care providers who were members of Seattle-based SEIU 925 at the time. The following summer, the foundation sent out canvassers to meet individually with child care providers.\\nAs of this past spring, almost two-thirds of family or child care providers no longer were paying dues to SEIU 925, according to the foundation.\\nOutreach efforts directed at 35,000 home care aides represented by Seattle-based SEIU 775 as of last year proved to be more difficult.\\nSEIU 775 fought in court and in the Washington state Legislature to prevent the Department of Social and Health Services from releasing a list of home care aides and contact information to the Freedom Foundation.\\nIn April 2016, a state appeals court ruled against SEIU 775, saying the information had to be disclosed under the state’s Public Records Act.\\nThe union also had lobbied state lawmakers to amend that law in 2015 and 2016 so that contact information for the individual care providers would be exempt from public records requests. This effort also failed.\\nTies to Governor\\xa0\\nIn early 2016, the Freedom Foundation began to receive contact lists from sources inside SEIU, making it possible to do the outreach. In September, the foundation received an official list of providers from Washington state officials after the state Supreme Court declined to hear the union’s appeal.\\nA separate but related educational campaign connected Freedom Foundation activists with about 1,000 workers who help the disabled and provide translation services for speakers of other languages. They were part of the Washington Federation of State Employees.\\nSEIU 775 continues to block and frustrate educational initiatives aimed at increasing understanding of free speech rights, Nelsen told The Daily Signal. The union received “special treatment” from government officials who benefit from its campaign contributions, he said.\\nA foundation study called the “Undue Influence Report” pulls together campaign finance data. It shows that Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, raked in almost $6 million from organized labor in his 2012 race for governor, compared with about $18,000 for his Republican opponent.\\nSEIU alone donated about $1.8 million to Inslee during the 2012 cycle.\\n“Union officials with the SEIU have implemented a comprehensive set of responses to Harris v. Quinn making it possible for them to skirt the law,” Nelsen said. “We have litigation challenging each of them, but it remains a tough fight given how well-connected the SEIU is with top government officials.”\\nSEIU 775 negotiated a collective bargaining agreement with the Inslee administration that calls for union dues to be withheld automatically unless an individual caregiver explicitly states that he or she doesn’t want dues to be deducted.\\n“This means every caregiver has union dues deducted from their paycheck regardless of whether or not they have signed up for the union,” Nelsen said. “We know from court filings that there are thousands of individuals who are having union dues deducted without their authorization, which we think is illegal.”\\nMillions in Illegal Dues\\nDavid Dewhirst, a litigation counsel with the Freedom Foundation, estimates that SEIU 775 collects $3.5 million in illegal dues each year. Each home caregiver pays about $585 per year to the union, he said, and about 6,000 caregivers did not give written authorization to the union to deduct dues.\\nThe foundation lost in the Supreme Court of Washington, however, when it argued in May that automatic deduction of dues violates state law.\\nThe organization has pursued a federal lawsuit against the Inslee administration and SEIU 775, seeking, in Nelsen’s words, “to end the various illegal and coercive means by which [individual care providers] are signed up for union membership.”\\nThe Daily Signal sought comment from Inslee, but did not receive a reply from the governor’s press office by publication deadline.\\nIn response to the Harris ruling by the nation’s highest court, SEIU changed the fine print on its membership form. Now, those who sign the form can’t cancel membership dues unless they submit a written statement during a 15-day annual window from 30 to 45 days before the anniversary of the date they first signed.\\n>>> Related: Home Caregivers Identify Evidence of Voter Fraud in Bid to Oust Union \\xa0\\nUntil recently, caregivers were required to attend union presentations delivered as part of their orientation process, administered through the Washington state Department of Social and Health Services.\\nDepartment officials were not permitted in the room while union officials delivered their pitch to incoming caregivers.\\n“We did file litigation that forced the SEIU and the state government to make the union portion of the orientation process voluntary,” Nelsen said. “This was a recent win, but we are still trying to address the fact that caregivers are not told that the union portion of their orientation is voluntary.”\\nMeanwhile, SEIU operatives fell back on what Nelsen describes as a “last-ditch effort” to prevent the Freedom Foundation from getting the names and contact information of caregivers—in the form of Initiative 1501, which won voter approval in November.\\nUnions advertised the initiative as a measure that would protect against identity theft, he said, but the real objective was to prevent the foundation from communicating with caregivers about their rights.\\n‘Playing Games’\\nThe Freedom Foundation filed suit in federal court,\\xa0challenging the constitutionality of Initiative 1501 under the U.S. Constitution’s First and 14th Amendments.\\nThe measure violates caregivers’ First Amendment right of free association and the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment, foundation lawyers argue, because unions can get ahold of personal contact information for caregivers while denying it to others.\\nThe Freedom Foundation, which marks its 26th anniversary this year, also has offices in Oregon and California, where it is expanding outreach efforts. Nelsen and other labor policy analysts also are eyeing legal developments in other states.\\nMinnesota, for instance, stands out as a particularly important test case. In that state, home caregivers accuse the local SEIU of forging signatures on union membership cards and committing voter fraud in a union election conducted by mail-in ballot.\\nNew cases challenging mandatory union dues continue to work their way up to the Supreme Court.\\nMinnich, the foundation’s executive vice president, cautions against the idea that favorable Supreme Court rulings will resolve the problem of labor practices that suppress free speech without committed activism.\\n“There is a certain amount of thinking out there that says favorable Supreme Court rulings will solve this problem,” Minnich said. “But in fact, when you look at our state [Washington] and Oregon and California and Minnesota, the lesson here is that state government officials and unions will continue to play games.”\\nHe added:\\nPeople are not going to know they have rights unless somebody is there to tell them that they don’t have to join a union and pay dues. Certainly, the union is not going to tell them that. What a favorable Supreme Court ruling really means is that our work is just beginning.',\n",

Janus is the lead plaintiff in a case\\xa0before the Supreme Court that challenges the constitutionality of state and local laws requiring government workers to pay “fair share” fees to unions as a condition of employment.\\nSuch fees are the payments that nonunion workers are required to pay to cover the costs of collective bargaining agreements between employers and employees. The Janus plaintiffs argue that union priorities are laced with political activism they don’t support and should not be forced to pay for as a condition of employment.\\nAlthough the Supreme Court previously turned away a legal challenge to the 6th Circuit ruling in favor of right to work, a lawyer with the Liberty Justice Center said he suspects the high court would step in if the 7th Circuit rules against Lincolnshire.\\n“If there were a circuit split, then this would be an appropriate issue for the Supreme Court to take up,” Jacob Huebert, director of litigation for the legal group, told The Daily Signal in an interview, adding:\\nWe certainly hope the Supreme Court would take the case up, because it’s an important issue and right to work creates opportunities for communities. Those states, like Illinois, that don’t have right-to-work [laws] generally have bad economic policies, and they find it hard to stimulate growth in their communities.\\nWhile the right-to-work ordinance remains on hold in Lincolnshire, both Sandoval County, New Mexico, and the city of Seaford, Delaware, enacted new laws earlier this year that are now in effect.\\nKentucky’s local right-to-work laws also remain on the books, but are superseded by the state law that made Kentucky a right-to-work state in 2017.\\n>>> Related: Kentucky’s Right-to-Work Earthquake Reverberates Across State Lines\\nLocal officials in other parts of New Mexico, Delaware, and Pennsylvania are eyeing their own versions of local right-to-work laws, The Daily Signal has learned.\\nWhat Labor Law Says\\nLincolnshire’s arguments in favor of its local ordinance closely resemble those of Hardin County, Kentucky, which prevailed in a unanimous ruling out of the 6th Circuit, Huebert said.\\n“We argue that the National Labor Relations Act has never pre-empted the field of right-to-work laws at all,”\\xa0 Huebert said. “The very first time the Supreme Court considered that question, it said there was no pre-emption. Congress didn’t intend to pre-empt the field, and there’s no basis for concluding that it did.”\\n“All of the legislative history in the National Labor Relations Act says that Congress intended to stay out of the question of right-to-work laws and leave questions about whether we should have right-to-work [laws] to the states,” he added.\\nThe National Labor Relations Act of 1935, also known as the Wagner Act, specifies that states and territories may enact right-to-work laws.\\nHowever, the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 399 AFL-CIO argues in its legal brief in the Lincolnshire case that the 1947 Taft-Hartley amendments to the law prevent localities from adopting right-to-work ordinances.\\nThe union brief asserts:\\nLocal right-to-work ordinances are not ‘state’ laws under § 14(b), and are, therefore, pre-empted by the NLRA. Such ordinances, adopted pursuant to a general grant of home-rule authority, do not constitute a state policy choice. The enactment of local right-to-work ordinances would interfere with state policy in those states that permit free collective bargaining over union security.\\nIn a phone interview Friday with The Daily Signal, William A. Widmer III, counsel to the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 399, said that section of federal labor law excludes municipalities and other political subdivisions from enacting their own right-to-work laws.\\n“During oral arguments, Judge Diane Wood clearly understood that when Congress passed the National Labor Relations Act, it was the intent of Congress to establish a national labor law with the right-to-work option limited to states,” Widmer said. “If the law permitted local governments to pass local right-to-work ordinances, you would have multiple, perhaps thousands of, different laws affecting collective bargaining.”\\nAs for the potential for a split between federal appeals courts on the issue, Widmer said:\\nI think the 6th Circuit got it wrong, and I think the 7th Circuit will get it right. When you have a split in the circuits, that is typically when the Supreme Court grants a writ of certiorari [and reviews a case]. But there is a strong argument to made that the subsequent action in Kentucky making Kentucky a right-to-work state means that the 6th Circuit ruling is now moot.\\n>>> Related: Right-to-Work Advocate Blames Unions’ Legal Threats for Loss\\nThe arguments for and against the local right-to-work ordinance in Lincolnshire turn on the authority states give to localities under home rule statutes.

The Illinois Constitution gives home-rule municipalities, such as the village of Lincolnshire, broad authority to enact laws that they believe will benefit their local jurisdictions. And the unions don’t even dispute that Lincolnshire’s home-rule powers under state law include the authority to enact a local right-to-work ordinance.\\nThe unions say federal law only allows ‘state’\\xa0 right-to-work laws, not local right-to-work laws, but states have the right to decide for themselves whether to exercise their power through their central governments or through local governments.\\nUnder Supreme Court precedent, if Congress wants to interfere with states’ internal arrangements for exercising their power, it must make a clear statement that it’s doing so. Congress didn’t do that in the National Labor Relations Act, so Illinois retained its authority to delegate its power to enact right-to-work laws to local governments.\\nBrent Yessin, a labor lawyer who has advised counties considering right-to-work measures in Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and New Mexico, said he sees a potential for the Supreme Court to eventually enter the fray as localities pass more ordinances.\\nThe counties in those states where he has served as an adviser, and in others, such as Ohio and Maryland, “clearly have the power to pass ordinances,” Yessin said in an email to The Daily Signal. “The overwhelming authority at the Supreme Court and circuit court level is that states can delegate their authority to regulate forced union dues, and the only issue is whether they have done so.”\\nAlthough he said he isn’t familiar with the situation in Illinois, Yessin said he is encouraged by legal developments in New Mexico. In January, the Sandoval County Commission passed a right-to-work bill in a 3-1 vote with one abstention.\\nJust a few weeks later, the New Mexico Federation of Labor filed suit. The union released a statement detailing some main arguments in the lawsuit, which identifies the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 611 and United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1564 as the two organizations most affected.\\nIn analyzing the unions’ arguments, Yessin said, he finds that they made a critical concession.\\n“In New Mexico, two unions concede that the state can delegate their power to prevent forced dues and are pinning their hopes on a finding [that] the state hasn’t actually done so,” he said. “But that legal retreat signals a win for cities and counties that want to create jobs even when their legislators can’t muster the courage to do so.”\\nJay Block, a Sandoval County commissioner and early supporter of right-to-work laws in New Mexico, told The Daily Signal that Otero County and McKinley County are considering their own ordinances. Legislation could be introduced within a few weeks, he said.\\n“We are asking elected officials across the state to stand up to forced unionism and to stand up for the full potential of this state to be an economic powerhouse,” Block said. “We are going one county at a time.”\\nOn the opposite side of the country, the new right-to-work law in Seaford, Delaware, has not been challenged in court.\\n“We are a small town without a lawsuit, which is a great thing,” Mayor David Genshaw said in an email. “Right now, we are working on spreading the word, because we are finding there are many people in our own state who don’t know about the law.”',\n",
       " '“In my opinion, the union is 100 percent political,\" says California teacher Ryan Yohn, lead plaintiff in a federal  case, pictured here Feb. 26 outside the Supreme Court.\\n (Photo: Kevin Mooney/The Daily Signal)\\nGovernment workers who don’t want to join unions should be able to “opt in” rather than “opt out” of union fees that finance political activism, some California teachers argue.\\n“Unions don’t want people to know how to opt out; they harass you and bully you once you do try,” @4kidsandcountry says.\\nUnless the nation’s highest court prohibits public employee unions from deducting dues and other fees from paychecks without consent, those workers will be forced to help pay for causes they don’t support, according to the teachers, who have filed a federal lawsuit in Los Angeles.\\nTwo teachers who are plaintiffs in Yohn v. California Teachers Association described to The Daily Signal how union “opt-out schemes” may be used to dilute any new ruling from the Supreme Court in favor of state government workers who have challenged mandatory union fees under the First Amendment.\\nThe teachers argue for the “opt in” approach both in their own case and in a friend-of-the-court brief filed on behalf of Illinois state workers in Janus v. AFSCME, a case now before the Supreme Court.\\n“The Janus case is making the same free speech argument that my case is,” Ryan Yohn, the lead plaintiff in the case, said in an interview on the steps of the Supreme Court. “But we have a second argument, and that is that we as teachers should be permitted to opt in rather than opting out from paying fees that go to support political activism we do not agree with.”\\n“In my opinion,” Yohn added, “the union is 100 percent political because you really cannot separate the overt political activism from the collective bargaining, which involves public policy questions.”\\nThe Daily Signal interviewed Yohn as he and others rallied Feb. 26 outside the Supreme Court on the morning \\xa0the justices heard oral arguments in Janus v. AFSCME.\\nYohn, a middle school teacher for 13 years for the Westminster School District in Southern California, \\xa0joined dozens of others who traveled from across the country to express support for Mark Janus, the lead plaintiff in that case. Janus is a child support specialist with the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services.\\n“Everything my union negotiates over is political,” Yohn said. “But so long as the union has my money, they don’t have to listen to me. The opt-out arrangement is set up perfectly for them because it means they already have our money to spend on politics.”\\n“But if we only had to decide just one time if we wanted to opt in and pay these fees,” he said, “then the union would have to listen to our concerns instead of just automatically having our money.”\\nFees to Prevent ‘Free Riders’\\nThe Janus case challenges the constitutionality of state and local laws requiring government workers to pay “fair share” fees to unions as a condition of employment.\\nLawyers for Janus and two other Illinois state employees who joined the case are asking the Supreme Court to overturn its 1977 ruling in Abood v. Detroit Board of Education that said public sector workers may be required to pay the fair-share fees, also known as agency fees, if they decline to join a union.\\nIn the Abood case, the justices concluded that those who don’t join a union should not be permitted to operate as “free riders” who benefit from collective bargaining on their behalf, and thus should pay fair-share fees. But the ruling also said nonunion workers should not be forced to pay for political activism they don’t support.\\n>>> Related: Mandatory Union Fees Divide Demonstrators as Supreme Court Hears Arguments\\nYohn’s case on behalf of teachers is modeled after Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, which made it to the Supreme Court. Because Justice Antonin Scalia unexpectedly died about a month after oral arguments on Jan. 11, 2016, however, the high court wound up deadlocking 4-4.\\nThat left a lower court ruling in place that upheld California’s “agency shop” law requiring nonunion workers to pay fair-share fees as a condition of employment.\\nSince the Janus case now before the high court doesn’t address the question of an opt-in arrangement versus an opt-out one, the legal challenge from Yohn and other California teachers could assume a heightened importance, Terry Pell, president of the Center for Individual Rights, told The Daily Signal in a phone interview.\\nIf the Supreme Court issues a narrow ruling in Janus that strikes down mandatory union fees without addressing the opt-in/opt-out question, Pell said, public employees such as Yohn could be forced to navigate through lengthy opt-out requests to get refunds for annual fees because of the way contracts are structured.\\n“If that happens, the Yohn case becomes very important and we will get it to the Supreme Court as fast as we can,” Pell said, noting that his group’s friend-of the-court brief in Janus asks for a broad opinion that addresses the opt-out issue.\\nThe Center for Individual Rights is a nonprofit, public interest firm based in Washington that represents the Yohn plaintiffs and also represented the Friedrichs plaintiffs.\\nIf the Supreme Court rules in favor of Janus and his fellow plaintiffs but leaves opt-out provisions in place, unions could argue that existing contracts require nonunion members to file paperwork seeking refunds for 100 percent of the annual fees rather than just a portion, Pell said.\\nDemonstrators congregate Feb. 26 outside the Supreme Court as the justices hear arguments in Janus v.

We all want to stay involved with the nuts and bolts of contract issues that matter to all of us regardless of political affiliation. The big problem we have is with the statewide affiliation, not with the local union, which is less of an overt political organization.\\nThe Daily Signal sought comment from the California Teachers Association, which had no responded at publication time.\\nBefore becoming a California teacher, Aster was a legislative assistant on education issues in the U.S. House of Representatives during the 1980s. He says he encountered union lobbyists on Capitol Hill who “were more interested in a political agenda than they were in true education issues.”\\nEach year, Aster said, he sends a letter to colleagues at his school advising them of their option to become a nonunion fee payer. His total union fees this year are $1,096; last year, they amounted to $1,059.\\nHis rebates on the political portion of the fees in the past 10 years ranged from $317 to $469, Aster said.\\nLeaving the union is a “big hurdle” for many colleagues since it means they lose out on certain benefits, he told The Daily Signal.\\n“The union holds out the liability insurance as a big carrot to keep people in the union,” he said. “If you resign, you also lose the right to vote in union elections, and there are other benefits you have to give up.”\\nThe Yohn case, currently before the federal district court in Los Angeles, has been stayed pending the outcome of the Janus case at the Supreme Court.\\nTurning out Feb. 26 at the Supreme Court for Illinois state government employee Mark Janus are, from left, Lindsay Killen, vice president for strategic outreach and communications at Mackinau Center, California teacher Rebecca Friedrichs, and Christine Hall, communications director at the Competitive Enterprise Institute. (Photo: Kevin Mooney/The Daily Signal)\\nOpt-Out System ‘Difficult, Arduous’\\nRebecca Friedrichs, who worked for 28 years as an elementary school teacher in the Savanna School District in Anaheim, California, was the lead plaintiff in the Friedrichs case that went to the Supreme Court in 2016.\\nFriedrichs joined nine other teachers and the Christian Educators Association International to sue the California Teachers Association, several local unions, and the National Education Association.\\nSince Friedrichs supports school choice, lower taxes, and traditional marriage, she is typically on the opposite side of public policy questions from union leadership. She filed her own friend-of-the-court brief in the Janus case, arguing in favor of an opt-in system for union fees.\\n“The first problem with the opt-out is the unions make it almost impossible to figure out how to opt out,” Friedrichs told The Daily Signal in a phone interview. “If you meet your average teacher on the street and ask them how to opt out, they would have no idea. The unions don’t want people to know how to opt out, and they harass you and bully you once you do try to opt out.”\\n>>> Related: Where Does Your State Stand on the Right to Work? This Project Maps Out Answers\\nWhile those who don’t belong to the union technically are permitted to get a rebate for the political portion of union fees, the process is “very difficult and very arduous,” Friedrichs said.\\n“The second problem with opting out is inertia,” she said, adding:\\nWhen you have to opt out, this means everyone is in until individual teachers figure out how to jump through all these hoops. This is not the way it should be. I think the unions should have to make an effort to earn my business.\\nThey shouldn’t automatically get my business and then make it difficult for me to get out. Instead, it should be the opposite approach. The union is a tax-free, private organization. As teachers we should be able to decide whether or not we want to opt in. If the unions have a valuable service to offer, let them make their case.\\nFree Speech Front and Center\\nFriedrichs said she hopes for a broad ruling in the Janus case.\\nIn her court filing, the veteran California teacher says her personal experiences demonstrate that “unions will bully, harass, and isolate workers to prevent them from taking affirmative action to stop subsidizing union political speech.” So, she argues, the Supreme Court should require government employers and unions to acquire the explicit consent of public employees before deducting union dues and fees from their paychecks.\\nUnion members and leaders who spoke with The Daily Signal outside the Supreme Court on the day of oral arguments in Janus said they oppose “free riders,” who they said shouldn’t be permitted to benefit from collective bargaining negotiations without paying union fees.\\nElizabeth Slattery, a legal fellow with The Heritage Foundation, sees current laws mandating union fees as an assault on the First Amendment.\\n“The Supreme Court’s rationale in the 1977 Abood case was that the government has compelling interests in dealing with an exclusive representative for its employees and in preventing labor unrest,” Slattery said in an email to The Daily Signal. “But a majority of the court has grown increasingly skeptical of whether these interests are important enough to override the First Amendment rights of the public employees.”\\nSlattery, who attended the oral arguments in the Janus case, said several exchanges between the opposing sides stood out.\\nIn one, she said, a lawyer from the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees suggested that if the justices rule against the unions, they should expect labor unrest throughout the country.\\nBut in a rebuttal, Bill Messenger, a lawyer with the National Right to Work Foundation, pointed out that the idea that agency fees are the price employees must pay to prevent unions from striking is radical. It’s similar to how the mob operates in demanding protection money, Messenger said.\\n“It’s certainly not an interest the court should accept as a reason to infringe the First Amendment rights of public employees,” Slattery said.\\nIf the Supreme Court finds mandatory agency fees are unconstitutional, that should resolve the opt-in, opt-out problem, she said, because “by joining the union, you opt in.”\\n>>> Commentary: 6 Key Exchanges From Major Union Case at the Supreme Court',\n",

Sussex County would be drawn into legal challenges at both the state and federal level that could prove costly,\\xa0 he said. \\n“My opinion is that a Delaware court is unlikely to uphold the ordinance in its current form,” Moore said. \\nThe county attorney also warned council members that if they did go forward with the ordinance and accept pro-bono legal coverage from outside the state, they would need to confer with the State Public Integrity Commission, whose rules cover payment to government employees.\\nBurton also spoke at length, saying he voted no because he was convinced by Moore that the county would incur legal costs that would detract from the council’s ability to perform its primary functions. \\n“If we adopt this ordinance, we will be in expensive, time-consuming litigation,” the council member said. \\nBurton credited Moore with providing a “thorough, extensive opinion.” \\nGiven the need to attract new jobs, Burton said, his vote was “one of the hardest decisions” of his career. \\nBurton expressed concern that enforcement of a controversial ordinance would burden the county with additional costs. \\n“I’m a proponent of limited government and of keeping costs low,” Burton said. “This will cause an expansion of government and new costs.”\\nLegal Landscape\\nVincent, the council president, said he shared Burton’s concerns about the legalities and also said the council could have handled the matter better procedurally.

Kittila expanded on this point, citing several cases, in a written legal opinion that is part of the public record.\\nKevin Fasic, a Wilmington-based lawyer who specializes in construction law, said during the council’s Oct. 24 meeting that a 6th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling opened the door for local right-to-work laws in Delaware and other parts of the country.\\nAs The Daily Signal has previously reported, the U.S. Supreme Court turned away a legal challenge to the local right-to-work ordinance in Hardin County, Kentucky, permitting the 6th Circuit ruling to stand.\\nThe 6th Circuit covers Kentucky, Michigan, Tennessee, and Ohio; Delaware falls within the 3rd Circuit, which has not ruled on the merits of local right-to-work laws.\\nIf the 3rd Circuit were to rule in conflict with the 6th Circuit, the case likely would move up to the U.S. Supreme Court. But Fasic noted during the October meeting that the high court may have signaled its intention to uphold local right-to-work laws last year when it rejected a petition from labor unions challenging the Kentucky law.\\nBut on Tuesday, Moore\\xa0insisted the legal questions are not entirely the same.\\n“Because some other county has done this, doesn’t mean that we can,” Moore said. “We have to look at the underlying legislation.”\\nWhile the ruling out of the 6th Circuit “may influence” the 3rd Circuit, it doesn’t “control” either the 3rd Circuit or the U.S. Supreme Court, Moore told council members.\\n‘Just the Beginning’\\n“Today, the Sussex County Council made a decision based on fear of litigation … unlike the city of Seaford, which made a decision based on principle and what is in the best interest of families,” Arlett told The Daily Signal later Tuesday in a phone interview more than two hours later, adding:\\nI don’t regret the decision to introduce the ordinance, because if I hadn’t I’m certain the city of Seaford would not have moved forward with their own ordinance.

       " 'Kentucky is poised to become the 27th right-to-work state. (Photo: Ryan Garza/TNS/Newscom)\\nKentucky’s Gov. Matt Bevin, a Republican, has now officially signed right-to-work legislation–along with other jobs legislation–into law.\\nYet the impact of Kentucky’s right-to-work legislation could move beyond the state’s borders.\\nRight-to-work laws prohibit employers from entering into agreements that make union membership and the payment of union dues a condition of employment.\\nAdditionally, Bevin signed the Paycheck Protection Act, which calls on workers to “opt in” if they want union dues withheld from their paychecks instead of requiring workers to “opt out” if they don’t want their union dues withheld.\\nThe other big-ticket item eliminates\\xa0the “prevailing wage”\\xa0employers must now pay on work funded with public money. This involves construction work on schools and government buildings.\\nThese laws could have a significant impact on the national debate over worker freedom. Kentucky is poised to become the 27th right-to-work state.\\nA Republican Wave\\n“Promises made, Promises kept.”\\nThat’s how Kentucky state Rep. Jason Nemes, R-Louisville, describes the successful push for right-to-work legislation that went down during Saturday’s special session of his state’s General Assembly.\\nNemes was elected in November along with a Republican wave that delivered the Kentucky House of Representatives to his party for the first time since 1921.\\n“I’m calling it promises made, promises kept because we ran on worker freedom, we ran on right-to-work, and we ran on paycheck protection and on repealing the prevailing wage law. We delivered in just the first week of the new General Assembly,” Nemes told The Daily Signal in a phone interview.\\n“These votes for right-to-work were about economic development and about making our state more competitive,” Nemes said. “But it isn’t just about economic development. Right-to-work is also about liberty and freedom of association. Someone shouldn’t be forced to join an organization just to put food on the table.”\\nKentucky labor unions, which held loud and boisterous protests in and around the statehouse in Frankfort, Kentucky, throughout the week and into Saturday, remain ardently opposed to the legislation the governor is set to sign into law.\\nUAW Local 2164, United Food and Commercial Workers Local 227, and the Kentucky State AFL-CIO are among the unions that expressed strong opposition to the right-to-work bill and other labor-related bills that passed Saturday.\\n“They don’t want to work for the working man and it’s sad but true but they want to fight unions every way they can fight us,” Monica Williams, president of UAW Local 2164, told The Daily Signal. “Unions are good for all people, not just for unions.”\\nThat’s unfortunate, Williams added, because unions deliver social and economic benefits that Republican critics overlook.\\nFrom Local to National Debate\\nWhat happened in Kentucky is not necessarily going to stay in Kentucky. That’s because the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers districts in Kentucky, Michigan, Tennessee, and Ohio,\\xa0 issued a ruling in November that upheld the right of localities to pass right-to-work ordinances in the absence of state-level legislation.\\nThe action began in Warren County, Kentucky, in the fall of 2014 with 11 other counties following suit.\\nThe Kentucky counties argued that because the federal government has already authorized states to pass right-to-work laws, it follows that the counties are also permitted to pass right to work since they are creations of the state. Therefore, the counties argued, local right-to-work ordinances are permissible unless a state legislative body explicitly forbids them.\\nJim Waters, president of the Bluegrass Institute, a libertarian, free-market think tank in Kentucky, said in a phone interview with The Daily Signal that Warren County’s decision to press ahead with its own ordinance certainly had an impact on what happened statewide.\\n“What this means is that we will no longer watch jobs and opportunities fly over or go around our state,” he said.\\nWaters pointed out that Kentucky’s largest border is with Tennessee, which is a right-to-work state, and four of Kentucky’s seven neighboring states are right to work: Indiana, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia.\\n“$1 billion in capital investment has gone into Warren County since it passed right to work in December 2014. Yes, that’s B as in billion,” Waters said. “These are not prospects; these are commitments. When legislators in other parts of the state saw what was happening in Warren County, they certainly took notice. I’m not saying it was the factor in determining what happened statewide, but it was certainly a factor.”\\nWaters also said that there are 55,000 new job openings in a 50-mile radius of where Warren County passed its right-to-work ordinance.\\n“That’s not a coincidence,” he said.\\n“I do believe our county government initiative advanced the Kentucky legislative effort, as it created a public awareness, and helped to educate citizens about right to work throughout the state,” Mike Buchanon, the Warren County judge-executive, said in an email. “The entire state was amazed at the remarkable increase in new prospects that contacted Warren County immediately after we passed right to work.”\\nBuchanon added:\\nKentucky is a great place for business. But the fact that we were the only state in the southeast U.S. that was not right to work kept us from being considered for a site for new locations by growing industries. Site selectors have told us that as many as 75 percent of their clients instructed them to eliminate any state that wasn’t right to work. That left Kentucky off the list of consideration, right from the beginning.\\nBut now that right to work has passed, Buchanon said, the state Legislature can “post a sign over the commonwealth’s front door” that says “Kentucky is open for business.”\\nKentucky’s Example Could Inspire Localities to Act\\nKentucky’s local clashes over right-to-work laws may now have an impact beyond even the state level.\\nThe drive for local right-to-work laws experienced a temporary setback in February when a federal district court ruled against a right-to-work ordinance in Hardin County, Kentucky. But the 6th Circuit ruling reversed that lower court ruling.\\nNemes, the Kentucky state representative, sees the 6th Circuit ruling giving impetus to localities outside of Kentucky.\\n“One difficulty we had with the local ordinances is that it was a novel approach and people were cautious because they knew the unions were going to sue,” he said. “But the 6th Circuit ruling in very powerful language upholding these local ordinances, will give courage to other localities to pass their own right-to-work ordinances.”\\nBefore being elected to the Kentucky House, Nemes served as an attorney coordinating the legal defense for the counties passing their own ordinances. He anticipates that Ohio counties will now be motivated to take up right to work. With the exception of Pennsylvania, Ohio is now surrounded by right-to-work states following the passage of the law in Kentucky.\\nJames Sherk, a labor policy analyst with The Heritage Foundation, sees a potential for legal disputes over local right to work to move up to the U.S. Supreme Court, depending on how the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals rules in a case out of Lincolnshire, Illinois, where a federal district judge ruled against a local right-to-work ordinance.\\n“If all the federal appeals courts rule the same way, the U.S. Supreme Court typically does not step in,” Sherk said. “But if the 7th Circuit were to rule against the local right to work, then you would have a conflict between the two circuits and typically the Supreme Court steps in to create consistency in the law when you have two circuits reading it differently. The litigation out of Illinois could go up to the Supreme Court potentially.”\\nSpreading to Other States\\nNow that Bevin has put his signature to the Kentucky bills, the primary legislative battleground over right-to-work laws will have already shifted over to Missouri, where that state’s House of Representatives is set to hold hearings Tuesday on its own legislation. The Missouri Senate is expected to follow up with hearings on its own version of the right-to-work bill later this week.\\nEric Greitens, Missouri’s newly-elected Republican governor, campaigned for right-to-work laws and it is widely expected that he will sign off on any new legislation that reaches his desk. Missouri fell just short of passing right to work in September 2015 when Republican lawmakers could not produce enough support to override then-Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon’s veto.\\nGrover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, and Matt Patterson, executive director\\xa0of the Center for Worker Freedom, have come out in support of a Missouri right-to-work law. The Center for Worker Freedom is a special project of Americans for Tax Reform, a nonprofit taxpayer advocacy group based in the District of Columbia.\\nNorquist and Patterson signed\\xa0a letter last week addressed to the Missouri General Assembly urging lawmakers to vote in favor of “right to work.”\\n“The towns and communities in Ohio that border right-to-work states are going to start feeling the pressure just as they did in Kentucky,” Patterson, the Center for Worker Freedom executive director, told The Daily Signal. “We are also going to see Missouri start to move very quickly on right to work with the hearings that come this week.”\\nNorquist and Patterson highlight key statistics in their letter as they make the case for ending forced unionization. They wrote:\\nRight-to-work states have seen an average of 68 percent greater job growth than the average of forced-unionization states, according to government labor statistics. In 2012, Indiana has seen its unemployment cut nearly in half since it passed its right-to-work law in 2012, from 9.1 percent in 2011 to 5.4 percent today. Currently, six of the eight states bordering Missouri are right to work, putting the Show Me State at a tremendous disadvantage. In order to boost its competitiveness and give Missouri businesses every advantage to grow and create jobs, lawmakers must do their part and allow them this valuable tool.\\nSherk said he expects to see Missouri become right to work in another few weeks. He also said the 6th Circuit ruling makes Ohio a clear candidate for local right-to-work laws since several of those localities will now be bordering right-to-work states.\\nThe example of Warren County, Kentucky, will not be lost in Ohio, he said. Within a few weeks of passing its ordinance, Warren County had 47 different development projects come its way, Sherk said.\\n“Warren County didn’t know it was missing out on these opportunities until it passed right to work,” Sherk said. “They didn’t know how many doors were being closed. A lot of Ohio townships and cities will look at this and will want to be part of it.”\\nIf local ordinances do take root in Ohio, which is a strong possibility, Sherk expects that other localities will start to pass ordinances in those areas of the country where a statewide option is out of reach for the moment.\\nSince Maine has a “long and strong tradition of powers given to localities,” it’s possible that it\\xa0might also act, Sherk said.\\nLooking ahead to 2018, he anticipates that Minnesota and Pennsylvania could consider new legislation if right-to-work candidates win the governor’s races in those states. Sherk also sees a potential for New Hampshire and Montana in the not-too-distant future.\\nBut even if Republicans take governor’s seats in key states where the GOP is gaining ground, right to work will remain a tough fight, Sherk warned.\\n“In Pennsylvania, the Legislature is more conservative than it was but the caveat there is that the left has taken control of the [state] Supreme Court,” he said. “So, you could see some judicial high-jinx.”\\nThis article has been modified.',\n",

Widely known as the Superfund program, it provides funds for cleaning up thousands of contaminated sites across the country that include such contaminants as lead, asbestos, dioxin-infused soil, and radiation.\\nContaminated locations include industrial facilities, landfills, and mining sites, according to a page on the EPA website detailing the Superfund’s history.\\nThe parties responsible either must clean up the sites themselves or cover the cost of EPA cleanups. If no party is found responsible for contamination, the program provides the EPA with the money and authority to perform the cleanup.\\nThe EPA distinguishes between full and partial deletions of sites from the Superfund list, which the agency uses to identify and prioritize sites that warrant investigation because they are known to have hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants.\\nFull deletions occur from the Superfund list “when all the remedies are successfully implemented and no further cleanup is required to protect human health or the environment.” Partial deletions occur when portions of a site are cleaned up while others require additional remediation, according to an EPA release.\\nThe agency’s annual list of full and partial deletions of Superfund sites shows the Trump administration well ahead of where remediation efforts were during the final two years of Barack Obama’s eight years as president.\\nThe Trump administration potentially could double the amount of sites deleted from the Superfund list in its first two years, in comparison to what the Obama administration recorded in 2015 and 2016.\\n“For decades, the Superfund program has been a bonanza for lawyers and remediation companies and a bust for the communities in which the sites are located,” Bonner Cohen, a senior fellow at the National Center for Public Policy Research, told The Daily Signal in an email, adding:\\nOnly now, under the Trump administration, has cleaning up contaminated sites and returning them to local communities in a timely fashion and at an acceptable cost become a priority for EPA.\\nThe average time from Superfund designation to completion of cleanup at a site was about 15 years. This means that an EPA employee assigned to the Superfund program could spend a 30-year career at the agency and oversee the cleanup of a grand total of two sites.\\nThis is an absurd waste of public and private resources, and the Trump EPA is to be applauded for bringing sanity to a program where it has been long absent.\\nThe 2018 update to the task force report says that over the next year, the agency will “continue to expedite cleanups and move sites towards deletion.”\\nActing EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler is scheduled to mark the one-year anniversary of the Superfund task force at an event Wednesday in New Bedford, Massachusetts.\\n“EPA has improved the health, living conditions, and economic opportunity of thousands of people living near Superfund sites over the past year as the agency worked to implement the Task Force recommendations,” Wheeler said in a press release.\\n“I am proud of the accomplishments achieved by EPA’s hardworking staff, and we will continue to engage directly with stakeholders and communities near Superfund sites to accelerate cleanup and promote economic revitalization. Our plan to complete Task Force recommendations by the end of 2019 will ensure this work continues as one of EPA’s highest priorities.”\\nThe task force’s complete recommendations are available here.',\n",

Nor will they look as far into the future to project what species face extinction.\\nThe changes likely will draw litigation from liberal and environmental groups.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“The best way to uphold the Endangered Species Act is to do everything we can to ensure it remains effective in achieving its ultimate goal—recovery of our rarest species,” Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said in a prepared statement.\\xa0\\n“The Act’s effectiveness rests on clear, consistent and efficient implementation. An effectively administered Act ensures more resources can go where they will do the most good: on-the-ground conservation,” Bernhardt, who took office in April, said.\\n>>> Related: The Government Relies on Flawed Data to Determine Endangered Species\\n\\xa0The new reform should make the law more effective in protecting threatened species, said Daren Bakst, senior research fellow in agriculture policy for The Heritage Foundation.\\xa0\\n“For over 45 years, the Endangered Species Act has failed to effectively recover species, with only about 3% of listed species getting delisted due to recovery efforts, largely due to how the federal government has implemented the law,” Bakst said in a written statement, adding:\\nThe Trump administration’s reforms to the Endangered Species Act modernize implementation and better allocate resources to provide protections for truly threatened and endangered species.\\nWhile more needs to be done to improve species conservation, the federal government is on the right track by recognizing past mistakes implementing the [Endangered Species Act] and taking steps to correct them. The Trump administration should be commended for these common-sense reforms.\\nCritics of the administration reportedly say the move stops the Interior Department from considering how climate change will harm a vulnerable species, while environmentalists claim this significantly weakens protections.\\nThe Endangered Species Act directs that determinations to add or remove a species from the lists of threatened or endangered species be based “solely on the basis of the best scientific and commercial information regarding a species’ status.”\\nUnder the new regulations, these will remain the only criteria on which listing determinations are based, according to the Interior Department.\\xa0\\nHowever, the revisions clarify that standards for de-listing and reclassifying a species ought to consider the same five statutory factors used in listing the species in the first place.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe Interior Department announcement notes that “in some cases, designation of critical habitat is not prudent.”\\xa0\\nThe agency said the new regulations reinstate a requirement that areas where threatened or endangered species are present at the time of listing be evaluated before unoccupied areas.\\xa0\\nThe rules also impose a higher standard for unoccupied areas to be designated as critical habitat. An unoccupied area must at the time of designation contain one or more of the physical or biological features essential to the species’ conservation.',\n",

(Photo: Mike Theiler/Reuters/Newscom)\\nFeathers are flying over whether the federal government is overprotecting a rare bird in Colorado, in what critics grouse is an example of lawyers making millions while abusing the Endangered Species Act.\\nTrial lawyers who collect taxpayer-funded fees under the law file so many suits that they undermine local conservation efforts in Western states, according to government officials, industry advocates, and legal analysts familiar with the situation.\\nIn Colorado, the situation prompted Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat, to sue the Obama administration early last year.\\nOver 25 years, Colorado\\xa0officials spent more than $40 million to preserve the habitat of a paunchy, ground-dwelling, chickenlike bird known as the Gunnison sage grouse.\\nColorado officials\\xa0worked in partnership with ranchers in Gunnison County, who voluntarily entered into conservation easements on their property that protected the bird while allowing for robust ranching activities.\\nIn the past few years, the Gunnison sage grouse population not only has stabilized but increased in the part of southwestern Colorado where they’re concentrated, local government figures show.\\nEven so, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service saw fit to list the species as “threatened” under the Endangered Species Act in November 2014.\\nKent Holsinger, a natural resources lawyer based in Denver, says he sees a perverse set of incentives at work that allow green groups such as WildEarth Guardians, a nonprofit environmental group, to file suits that ultimately work against the bird’s environment and the local community.\\nUnder a section of the Endangered Species Act providing for citizen suits, nonprofit environmental groups may bring litigation against the federal government. U.S. taxpayers often foot the bill for the substantial fees the groups pay to their attorneys.\\nIn the U.S. House of Representatives, the Natural Resources Committee has\\xa0obtained documents from the Justice Department that show U.S. taxpayers paid out more than $15 million in attorney’s fees over four years to cover the costs of lawsuits brought under the Endangered Species Act.\\nSome lawyers are paid as much as $500 an hour, the documents show.\\nA male Gunnison sage grouse fans its tail feathers near Gunnison, Colorado. (Photo: Colorado Parks and Wildlife)\\nTime for Reform?\\n“We desperately need reforms to the Endangered Species Act,” Holsinger said, adding:\\nSo long as these litigation provisions are around, it will create openings for habitual abusers of the law like WildEarth Guardians to continuously sue. They are nothing more than a group of trial lawyers who have found a profitable niche to collect attorney’s fees at taxpayer expense and to perpetuate these legal actions that do no good for the environment or for the community as a whole, but they are very good for WildEarth Guardians.\\nThe Gunnison County ranchers entered into agreements with state officials so they could help to preserve the Gunnison sage grouse while obtaining some level of certainty that they wouldn’t be punished for their ranching activities, Holsinger said.\\nBut, he warned, if “radical environmental groups” continue to litigate and put pressure on government agencies to apply more restrictions, especially where public lands are concerned, it could mean ranchers will be forced to sell their property.\\n“This is about their livelihood,” Holsinger said of the ranchers. “If they are cut back from the status quo, which is a distinct possibility, then their ability to earn a living will be impacted and that means they will have to sell their property, with the most likely purchaser being a developer.”\\nErik Molvar, a wildlife biologist with WildEarth Guardians, sharply disagrees with critics of the Endangered Species Act, including the provision for lawsuits, and said he would prefer no major changes.\\n“Without the ESA, it would be politics as usual and extractive industries would continue to have the right to drive [wildlife] populations into extinction,” Molvar said. “The ESA was created to make decisions based solely on science so politics could not enter into these decisions. This gets us past the political roadblocks to prevent the extinction of rare species.”\\nDemocratic Governor Sues Obama Administration\\nIn January 2015, WildEarth Guardians and another environmental group, the Center for Biological Diversity, filed separate lawsuits against the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. They argued that the listing of “threatened” for the Gunnison sage grouse doesn’t provide sufficient protection and should be raised to “endangered.”\\nWildEarth Guardians joined in its suit with Clait Braun, a retired sage grouse researcher with the Colorado Division of Wildlife who since 2000 has operated Grouse Inc., an Arizona-based consulting firm that studies\\xa0the sage grouse. In the second case, the Center for Biological Diversity joined with the Western Watersheds Project.\\nA few weeks later, Hickenlooper, a Democrat, filed\\xa0a lawsuit against President Barack Obama’s Interior Department and the agency’s Fish and Wildlife division in an effort to overturn the “threatened” listing. Gunnison County, which is heavily Democratic, later joined with\\xa0the governor\\xa0in the suit.\\nColorado Democrats “felt like they had no recourse but to file suit against their own party in Washington, D.C.,” and that “shows just how out of touch the Obama administration is with sound public policy,” Brian Seasholes, director of the Endangered Species Project for the Reason Foundation, said in an interview with The Daily Signal.\\n“For over two decades now, Gunnison County has been engaged in a very successful effort to boost the sage grouse population, but it appears Fish and Wildlife either failed to properly analyze the facts on the ground or simply ignored what the science said about the bird’s population.”\\nThe “best available science” demonstrates that the Gunnison sage grouse “is not threatened throughout its range,” Hickenlooper’s lawsuit argues, adding:\\n The Gunnison Basin population, which comprises the vast majority of the species, is not presently in danger of extinction, nor is it likely to be at risk of extinction in the foreseeable future. In fact, experts cited in [the Fish and Wildlife Service’s] Final Listing Rule estimated that the risk of extinction over the next 50 years is no more than 1 percent. Thus, [the wildlife agency’s] decision to list the Gunnison sage grouse as threatened was arbitrary, capricious, and not in accordance with law.\\n“The Interior Department’s penalty-based approach to sage grouse conservation is going to harm the bird while Colorado’s approach, which is incentive-based, cooperative, and draws heavily on partnerships, has a proven track record of helping the sage grouse,” Reason Foundation’s Seasholes said.\\n\\nIn the Event of a Meteor Strike \\nPaula Swenson, the longtime Democratic chair of the Gunnison Board of County Commissioners, told The Daily Signal that it’s \\xa0evident to her that the federal wildlife agency did not rely upon sound scientific data in making its determination. \\nShe points out that for almost 20 years now, the Fish and Wildlife Service has said that the survival of the Gunnison sage grouse is dependent upon the viability of the Gunnison Basin population, located primarily in Gunnison County and in a small part of Saguache County.\\nIn total, there are about 5,000 Gunnison sage grouse spread throughout southwestern Colorado and southeastern Utah, according to federal figures, with about 85 percent residing in Gunnison Basin. \\xa0\\nSwenson notes that Colorado Parks and Wildlife, the state agency charged with monitoring and providing science on conservation efforts, has determined that the Gunnison sage grouse population is stable and not threatened in the foreseeable future. Moreover, federal officials at the Fish and Wildlife Service concurred with the state’s findings, Swenson explained in an email:\\nThey also agree that the efforts of our local government, property owners and partnerships with state and federal agencies have sustained this population. However, since the six satellite populations, which combined only make up about 15 percent of the total population, are not seeing the same sustainability numbers that the Gunnison [River] Basin is, the [Fish and Wildlife Service] chose to list this species as threatened. The [federal agency] systematically divided the species into Gunnison Basin and all other populations instead of looking at the species viability as a whole. The rationale provided was all speculation, not science.\\nSwenson said she was incredulous at the reasoning behind the federal agency’s decision-making.\\n“The reasons for listing that were stated to me included [that] if a disease came into the Gunnison Basin it could wipe out the species, or my favorite [reason]: \\xa0A meteor could crash in the Gunnison Basin and wipe out the species.”\\nMolvar, the WildEarth Guardian biologist, said he is not convinced the population is stable. The main population is probably less than 5,000, he estimates, the “bare minimum to have a stable population.” \\n“Even if you believe the Gunnison Basin is stable and secure, you are still putting all your eggs in one basket,” Molvar said. “One major catastrophe like a West Nile virus could wipe out the population and drive it to extinction.”\\n“The rationale provided was all speculation, not science,” the Democratic chairman of the county\\xa0commissioners said of federal officials’ designating\\xa0the Gunnison sage grouse as “threatened.” (Photo: iStock Photos)\\nGreen Lawsuits Seen as the Problem \\nJohn Swartout, a Republican, is a senior policy adviser to Hickenlooper. A bipartisan consensus is emerging in favor of reforming the Endangered Species Act so that it can “live up to its full potential without being so dominated by litigation,” the governor’s adviser said in an interview with The Daily Signal.\\nThe problem is “with the adversarial structure” attached to the law and not U.S. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell or her department, Swartout insisted.\\n“We have no complaints about the secretary of interior and the people who work with her,” he said, adding:\\nShe has been great to work with and she’s done a lot to be helpful despite the fact that we filed litigation. This has been a bad situation not of her creation. The governor felt like the landowners had done everything we asked them to do and made a superhuman effort. They really stepped up and did everything that was necessary. This isn’t about us being mad at the [Obama] administration. It’s about us having the backs of the people who tried to do what they could to protect the sage grouse.\\nThe Gunnison sage grouse is a close cousin of the greater sage grouse, which resides in Colorado and 10 other Western states. \\nIn September 2015, the Fish and Wildlife Service declined to list the greater sage grouse as either threatened or endangered under the federal law. But, the Interior Department and Agriculture Department instead have imposed 15 land use amendments covering more than 60 million acres of federal land that restrict activities in the habitat of the greater sage grouse. \\nFederal bureaucrats are making a deliberate effort to subdivide species that have few or no biological differences, said Ethan Lane, executive director of both the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association and the Public Lands Council, an advocacy group for Western ranchers who hold grazing permits for public lands.\\n“The fact that these [grouse] populations have been split off into separate species is done to create more opportunities for lawsuits and this speaks to a big part of the problem with the Endangered Species Act,” Lane told The Daily Signal. “In order to keep the machine pumping, the litigation factory culture that has taken over the environmental community has found that it’s easy to split off populations that are not really so different.”\\nThe land use plans, set in motion by Interior’s Bureau of Land Management and USDA’s Forest Service, impose limits on where livestock can graze with the intent of creating buffer zones around the sage grouse’s habitat. \\nState and local officials in Utah, Idaho, and Nevada filed suit to overturn the land use amendments. \\nFour environmental groups—WildEarth Guardians, the Center for Biological Diversity, the Western Watersheds Project, and the Prairie Hills Audubon Society—filed a suit against the federal government aimed at closing off what they view as “loopholes” in the amendments. \\nThe Denver-based Western Energy Alliance filed a separate suit challenging oil and gas restrictions in the land use plans.

The mouse was first listed as an endangered species in 1970. (Photo: Aric Crabb/Oakland Tribune/MCT/Newscom)\\nAmericans who live in or near a community built around a lake should be careful about stepping outside to mow the lawn if the temperature isn’t just right and the grass isn’t a certain height.\\nThey should keep pets indoors. They should forget about using weed killer. And they should be prepared to pony up a steep homeowners association fee.\\nThat’s because there may be snakes in the area protected by the Endangered Species Act of 1973, which imposes stiff penalties and fines for violating its rules and restrictions.\\nRob Gordon, a senior research fellow with The Heritage Foundation, discovered the situation while researching the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s 1999 decision to list the Lake Erie water snake as a “threatened” species.\\nThe Fish and Wildlife Service estimated the population of that particular water snake to be somewhere between 1,530 and 2,030 at the time. But just a few years later, the agency revised it to 5,690.\\nThe government either made a “substantial underestimation” with the initial listing or the water snake had “a truly miraculous population growth rate” in a short time, Gordon observes in a recently published research paper that finds the listing process under the Endangered Species Act to be riddled with “erroneous data.”\\nGordon concludes that “essentially half of the species” identified by Fish and Wildlife Service officials as “recovered” never should have been listed in the first place.\\nThe regulatory fallout for developers, homeowners, and business owners who run up against the endangered species law is the same regardless of whether federal officials used sound science or flawed methodology, Gordon told The Daily Signal in an interview.\\n“Once a species is listed, it is regulated and the way it’s regulated doesn’t vary dependent upon the quality of the data the agency used,” Gordon said. “If one listing is legitimate and another listing is illegitimate based on erroneous data, the practical consequences are the same to the property owner or the business owner. He or she still faces the same restrictions whether or not these restrictions are legitimately based on science.”\\nAfter reviewing the Fish and Wildlife Service’s documentation in the case of the Lake Erie water snake, Gordon found the agency worked to impose “surreal regulatory hurdles” against a developer who sought to build seven houses on 15 acres.\\nThe Fish and Wildlife Service called for easements to be placed on over five acres of lakefront property that would be donated to a nonprofit organization. The agency also sought a $50,000 “contribution” from the developer to cover construction of a hibernation habitat for the snakes, and creation of a homeowners association that would impose additional restrictions.\\n‘Federally Funded Fiction’\\nThe case of the Lake Erie water snake “is a small example of the heavy-handed regulatory process for just one of the nearly 1,700 listed species to which landowners and businesses are repeatedly subject across the nation,” Gordon writes in his paper.\\nAlthough the government delisted the snake in 2011, numerous restrictions popped up in the meantime.\\nHomeowners association restrictions stipulated that residents make sure no snake was within 20 feet when applying weed killer to poison ivy, that they not allow cats outside, and that they abide by seasonal height and temperature guidelines for mowing lawns. Collectively, residents also had to provide up to $18,750 for snake research, and allow researchers to have access to their properties.\\n“This seems really over the top, doesn’t it?” Gordon asked in the interview with The Daily Signal. “And keep in mind that the snake’s actual population numbers were probably undercounted in the first place.”\\nGordon describes the recovery figures that Fish and Wildlife officials cite as “federally funded fiction” that dramatically inflate the number of species that genuinely were endangered and subsequently preserved.\\n“With all the ESA’s costs and burdens, it should perhaps come as no surprise that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is fabricating success stories to cover up this unsustainable mess and substituting fluff for statutorily required reporting regarding the recovery program,” he writes of the law in his paper.\\nThe errors that result in listing species that are not genuinely endangered stem in large part from the “low bar for scientific data” set by the agency, Gordon concluded.\\nThe Endangered Species Act calls for the “best available scientific and commercial data” to be used in the listing process. But here’s the problem, from Gordon’s point of view: Fish and Wildlife officials interpreted this directive to mean the information underpinning a listing doesn’t need to be complete or accurate.\\n“The agency has not set a high enough bar and sometimes they are using scant or even nonexistent data to list species,” Gordon told The Daily Signal. “They are using speculation and surmise as opposed to verifiable data, and in some instances they won’t even share the data. It’s no wonder that consequently all sorts of species are erroneously listed. That’s what happens when you have weak data standards.”\\nHow bad is the problem?\\nOf 1,662 plants and animals listed by the Fish and Wildlife Service as either “endangered” or “threatened” in the past 45 years, the government had removed 68 before Gordon published his paper in April.\\nOf those 68, 11 were removed from the list because they had gone extinct and 19 were removed because of errors in the original data. That leaves 38 species delisted because they were “recovered.”\\nTaxpayers on Hook for ‘Deceitful Practices’\\nUnder the Endangered Species Act, the conservation process involves “the use of all methods and procedures which are necessary to bring any endangered species or threatened species to the point at which the measures provided … are no longer necessary.”\\nEndangered species are considered to be at the brink of extinction, while threatened species are considered likely to be so in the near future.\\nGordon initially determined that “almost half” of the 38 species listed as “recovered” were actually “false recoveries” because they were based upon original data error.\\nHowever, since his paper was published three more species have been delisted and he has concluded that two—the lesser long-nosed bat and the black-capped vireo—were listed based on erroneous data.\\nFor this reason, he now says “essentially half” of the species the Fish and Wildlife Service identified as recovered are not genuine recoveries.\\nGordon says he also found other examples of “recovered” species that are really “mixed bags,” meaning the number of recoveries resting on erroneous data could be much higher.\\n(The full list of delisted species is available here.)\\nThe Daily Signal sought comment from the Interior Department and the Fish and Wildlife Service on Gordon’s findings and whether Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke might consider his recommended reforms. Officials had not responded as of publication.\\nUnfortunately, U.S. taxpayers are footing the bill for “deceitful practices that portray mistakes as successes,” Gordon told The Daily Signal.\\nThat’s because each listing sets in motion mandatory actions and government expenditures under federal law, he said.\\nFor instance, according to Gordon’s paper, the Fish and Wildlife Service reported in 2014 that the “median cost for preparing and publishing a 90-day finding is $39,276; for a 12-month finding, $100,690; for a proposed rule with critical habitat, $345,000; and for a final listing rule with critical habitat, $305,000.”\\n“These are just the paperwork costs and the bureaucratic costs of listing species whether they were legitimately listed or if they were listed based on erroneous data,” he told The Daily Signal. “But they are a drop in the bucket compared to the costs borne by private parties such as companies, farmers, and ranchers who have to comply with all kinds of mandates and have to absorb the loss in the value of their land because of their inability to use it and other significant opportunity costs.”\\n\\nSpecial Interest Groups Drive Litigation\\nGordon points to restrictions the Fish and Wildlife officials sought to impose to protect the Lake Erie water snake as an example of excessively burdensome costs.\\nGordon’s paper was the subject of a panel discussion April 25 at The Heritage Foundation where he was joined by Rob Roy Ramey, a wildlife biologist based in Denver, and Jonathan Wood, a lawyer with the Pacific Legal Foundation who specializes in environmental and constitutional law.\\nRamey called for greater openness and transparency on the part of federal officials and suggested that all the data Fish and Wildlife officials use in their decisions to list species should be made public.\\n“That way we have a common currency of accountability available to the entire nation,” Ramey said at the Heritage event. Without access to the data, he said, “there’s no opportunity for reproducibility,” which means listing and delisting decisions may not be based on the best scientific information.\\nRamey cited several examples of responses from government officials who resisted information requests. His personal favorite came from a “rogue recovery team member” who said:\\nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service data was deliberately provided in a format that would not facilitate detailed analysis by those unfamiliar with the manner in which the data was collected.\\nOther examples included “the data you requested are proprietary,” “we are still using this data,” and “those data may no longer exist.”\\nRamey warned that Fish and Wildlife officials who have “cherry-picked” and “fabricated” data to list species as endangered or threatened drew resources away from creatures in genuine need of protection, such as blue whales, California condors, rhinoceroses, and gorillas.\\nWood, the lawyer with the Pacific Legal Foundation, a nonprofit headquartered in Sacramento, California, credited Gordon with research that shows how often examples of species recovery touted as successes for the Endangered Species Act “are little more than fake news.”\\nSpecial interest groups play a role in the listing process, Wood said at the Heritage event.\\n“What really drives the Endangered Species Act is litigation,” he said. “The reality is that the listing process is fundamentally broken, it is completely litigation driven, and it is a problem for administrations regardless of party.”\\nThe Obama administration sought to develop a work plan to “seize some control back” over the listing process, Wood told the audience, so that key factors such as a species’ actual vulnerability would be considered and a listing would not be the result of “which special interest group is yelling the loudest.”\\nPotential Reforms for Interior Department\\nIn his research, Gordon highlighted examples of listings where the initial count of a species population was dramatically off based on flawed methodology. He cited the Monito gecko during his talk at Heritage.\\nThis lizard resides on Monito Island off the coast of Puerto Rico, which spans about 40 acres surrounded by 217-foot cliffs. The initial search Fish and Wildlife officials used as the basis to list the species in 1982 was organized during the day, when 18 lizards were found.\\n“The problem here is that the lizard is nocturnal,” Gordon told The Daily Signal. “So, if you are walking around during the middle of the day, you are not going to find it. The creature burrows down into rocks. In 2016, they finally did a proper survey during the evening and they came up with an estimate of about 5,000 to 10,000 geckos. That’s what you call a big difference.”\\nGordon spelled out several potential reforms that the Trump administration’s Interior Department could embrace under Zinke’s leadership.\\nFor starters, Zinke could issue an order directing the Fish and Wildlife Service “to accurately identify the data that forms the bases for removing or downlisting species,” Gordon writes in his report.\\nHe also recommends that the agency correct the record and acknowledge instances where a species was wrongly declared to have “recovered.”\\n“Right now, the Fish and Wildlife Service asserts that the listings are driven by science, but in truth the listings are often driven by litigation and the scientific standards are so weak that they are often listing species as endangered when they should never have been listed,” Gordon said, adding:\\nThe first step in correcting the problem is to admit that it exists. What needs to be done now is to go back and look at species that were claimed as recovered and to put your foot down and acknowledge that many of them were not really recoveries and they were based on erroneous data. Then, going forward, they need to make sure future listings are not based on speculation.\",\n",

More than any country in the history of the world, we have the longest sentences, the largest prison populations, the most bloated law enforcement budgets, and the highest recidivism rates,” Boudin said in a speech after being sworn in.\\n >>> Related: Tents, Homelessness, and Misery: 9 Things I Saw in San Francisco\\n“We consistently fail to address the needs of survivors of sexual assault; to offer restitution to victims of property crime; to include non-English speakers; to heal the trauma caused by violent crime,” he said. “These failures have led us, as a community, as a nation, to accept the unacceptable.”\\nDuring the campaign, Boudin wrote that if elected, he would establish an immigration unit in the San Francisco DA’s office. \\nHe said the unit would “investigate and prosecute crimes ICE agents commit against members of the community, which include illegal arrests, racial profiling, child endangerment, kidnapping, and even human trafficking.”\\nBoudin’s campaign website said that ICE is not above the city’s sanctuary law, which he helped craft as a deputy public defender.\\xa0\\n“That’s why the Immigration Unit will investigate these abuses, and when ICE agents break California law and endanger our communities, they will be prosecuted,” the campaign site said. “In addition, if any agents violate our Sanctuary City Ordinance or our State Sanctuary laws and hold our community members for ICE agents, they will be prosecuted.”\\n\\nBoudin promised that his office would not prosecute based on “quality-of-life” issues, including crimes such as public drug use, vandalism, public defecation and urination, and public solicitation of sex.\\xa0\\nSan Francisco faces a growing crisis of homeless residents camped on sidewalks and elsewhere, often engaged in these type of offenses. Other crimes such as car break-ins and thefts also plague the city.\\xa0\\nBoudin’s response to homelessness is a crackdown on what he has called “corporate landlords.”\\nAs a candidate, Boudin said in an ACLU questionaire: “Crimes such as public camping, offering or soliciting sex, public urination, blocking a sidewalk, etc. should not and will not be prosecuted.”\\nAmong his first acts was implementing a new “local option” law under which parents charged with a crime may participate in a diversion program to avoid jail time in order to be with their children. The law covers all misdemeanors and nonviolent felonies.\\xa0\\nI am proud to implement the state's new Primary Caregiver Diversion program, a program obviously close to my heart. This policy will keep children united with their parents and work to end the generational cycle of incarceration. pic.twitter.com/lPwspmvttI\\nOn the day Boudin was sworn in, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor delivered a video message expressing her support:\\nChesa, you too are an example that gives hope to so many. It is uncommon for a former public defender to become a district attorney of a major city like San Francisco. Especially a district attorney who spent his childhood visiting parents incarcerated for committing serious felonies. \\nYour personal strength and commitment to reforming and improving the criminal justice system is a testament to the person you are and the role model you will continue to be for so many.\\nThank you, Justice Sotomayor, for your leadership, the example you set for all of us, and for your thoughtful words of support. I'm humbled by your support of our movement & I promise to do the work required to make our vision of a just society a reality. pic.twitter.com/Y1aE9970FT\\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., also heralded Boudin’s victory in November.\\xa0\\n“Now is the moment to fundamentally transform our racist and broken criminal justice system by ending mass incarceration, the failed war on drugs and the criminalization of poverty,” the self-professed democratic socialist said in a tweet. “Congratulations @chesaboudin on your historic victory!”\\nNow is the moment to fundamentally transform our racist and broken criminal justice system by ending mass incarceration, the failed war on drugs and the criminalization of poverty. Congratulations @chesaboudin on your historic victory! https://t.co/2CiM1sFo5c\\nAlthough it was a close race, it isn’t surprising that someone on the far left would become district attorney in San Francisco, said Will Swaim, president of the California Policy Center, a conservative think tank.\\xa0\\n“As an observer of San Francisco politics, this is to be expected given his pedigree of a who’s who of the American left, the family trajectory along with his education and resume,” Swaim told The Daily Signal.\\nEven as criminal justice reform to reduce recidivism has gained bipartisan support, Swaim said, Boudin’s views on incarceration are well out of the mainstream.\\xa0\\n“I don’t judge someone because his parents were part of a terrorist group, but I would note he views himself as a victim of incarceration,” Swaim said. “These were acts by his parents.”\\nOn Oct. 20, 1981, Boudin’s mother, Kathy Boudin, dropped off the 14-month-old with a babysitter. She then joined Boudin’s father, David Gilbert, as part of a joint operation of the Weather Underground and Black Liberation Army to rob an armored truck in Nanuet, New York.\\xa0\\nThe failed robbery ended in the deaths of two police officers and one security guard. Both parents were convicted of murder charges, although they didn’t pull the trigger in the slayings.\\xa0\\nBoudin’s mother attended his inauguration, and he addressed both parents in his remarks: \\nThe crime you both participated in when I was an infant cost innocent men with families their lives. It did not matter to the DA or the judge that neither of you was armed nor that you did not personally hurt anyone. Those details matter to me. What matters even more is that since that terrible day you and my father have focused your lives on love.\\nWhen both his parents were sentenced to prison, two other leaders of the Weather Underground movement, Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn, took care of Boudin in Chicago.\\xa0\\nAyers and Dohrn were instrumental in the political rise in Chicago of Barack Obama before he became a U.S. senator. Both Ayers and Dohrn participated in bombings and other domestic terror activities, but their cases were dropped because they were tainted by illegal FBI surveillance.\\xa0\\nBoudin’s mother, now 76, was paroled in 2003, but his father, 75, remains in prison.\\xa0\\nBoudin went on to graduate from Yale and Oxford. During graduate school, he traveled to Venezuela, where he worked as a translator for Chavez. In 2009, he wrote an article praising the socialist dictator for doing away with term limits.\\xa0\\nAfterward, he traveled back to the United States to work in the San Francisco Public Defender’s Office.\\xa0\\nBoudin was quoted in The New York Times in 2002 as saying: “Now I’m not angry. I’m sad that my parents have to suffer what they have to suffer on a daily basis,” simply because they were “dedicated to fighting U.S. imperialism around the world.”\\xa0\\nSwaim said he understands the allure of extremist ideologies firsthand.\\xa0\\n“I was a Communist Party member in my early 20s, but I had a family to go back to,” Swaim said. “If it takes a village, Boudin’s village was rigorously Marxist. … I had to see the failures of socialism even as I tried to acquire the worldview. I doubt he has had that struggle. Also, San Francisco usually finds ways to make bad things worse.”\\nThe San Francisco District Attorney’s Office did not respond to phone and email inquiries for this report.\\xa0\\nFor several years, a national trend has seen election of\\xa0 progressive prosecutors focused on curbing incarceration and pursuing fewer drug crimes.\\xa0\\nThose elected include Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx in Chicago, Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, Bexar County District Attorney Joe Gonzales in Texas, and Suffolk County District Attorney Rachael Rollins, who prosecutes cases in a Massachusetts jurisdiction that includes Boston.\\nMoving from a public defender’s office to become district attorney is unusual, noted John Malcolm, director of the Meese Center for Legal and Judicial Studies at The Heritage Foundation.\\xa0\\n“Anybody whose platform is not prosecuting quality-of-life crimes is taking a very political position that is ominous,” Malcolm told The Daily Signal. “If you don’t prosecute people for having sex in public, defecating [in public], and drug use in public, then San Francisco will be a magnet for lawlessness.”\",\n",
       " 'House impeachment manager Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., prepares for the continuation of the impeachment trial of the president on Thursday. (Photo: Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call/Getty Images)\\nHouse Democrats on Thursday, in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, argued that a crime isn’t necessary to remove a president from office and doubled down on their defense of Joe and Hunter Biden.\\xa0\\nThe seven House Democrats who are the impeachment managers, including Reps. Adam Schiff of California and Jerry Nadler of New York, have three days, with up to 24 hours, to make their arguments.\\xa0\\xa0\\nOn Saturday, the president’s legal defense team, which includes White House counsel Pat Cipollone; Trump’s personal lawyer, Jay Sekulow; and former independent counsel Ken Starr, begin their counterarguments.\\xa0\\nAfter each side presents its case, the Senate will vote on whether to call witnesses to testify. The rules are similar to those used in the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton, who was acquitted.\\xa0\\nIt takes a two-thirds vote, or 67 senators, to remove a president from office.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAfter a deeply partisan fight over Senate trial rules on Tuesday and speaking for about two hours in Wednesday’s opening argument, Schiff, the lead impeachment manager, was more lighthearted Thursday.\\nAfter Chief Justice John G. Roberts opened the day’s session, he said House impeachment managers have 16 hours and 42 minutes left to make their case to the Senate “jurors.”\\xa0\\nSchiff, the House Intelligence Committee chairman, spoke first for his team.\\xa0\\n“I am not sure the chief justice is fully aware of just how rare it is, how extraordinary it is, for the House members to be able to command the attention of senators sitting silently for hours—or even for minutes, for that matter,” he said. “Of course, it doesn’t hurt that the morning starts out every day with a sergeant-at-arms warning you that if you don’t, you will be imprisoned.”\\nRep. Sylvia Garcia, D-Texas, spent much of her floor time defending former Vice President Joe Biden, a fellow Democrat, and his son Hunter Biden.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“Common sense will tell us that this allegation against Joe Biden is false,” Garcia said, adding, “President Trump asked for the investigation into Biden, based on a made-up theory that no one agreed with—no one.”\\nIn 2016, Joe Biden, as vice president, threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid from Ukraine unless the Eastern European nation fired Viktor Shokin, the prosecutor investigating Burisma Holdings. Hunter Biden held a high-paying job on the board of\\xa0 Burisma at a time when his father was the Obama administration’s point man for Ukraine.\\xa0\\nGarcia said Shokin was corrupt.\\xa0\\n“Calling for Shokin’s replacement would, in fact, increase the chances that Burisma would be investigated,” she said. “In other words, Shokin was corrupt and not investigating allegations against Burisma. So, Vice President Biden was calling for Shokin’s removal, advocating for a replacement, would actually increase the chances of Burisma’s investigation.”\\nGarcia said Trump wasn’t interested in the Biden allegations in 2017 or 2018, but only became interested in 2019, after Joe Biden became a presidential candidate.\\xa0\\n“Vice President Biden’s conduct was uniformly validated by the witnesses in the House investigation, who confirmed his conduct was consistent with U.S. policy,” she said.\\nGarcia’s adamant defense of the Bidens opened the door to call them as witnesses, tweeted Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., so the Senate can get answers.\\nWOW, House managers make extended argument that Hunter Biden’s work w/ Burisma entirely appropriate & no conflict of interest w/ Joe Biden getting rid of prosecutor that had jurisdiction over Burisma. If we call witnesses, gonna need to hear from both Bidens\\n“WOW, House managers make extended argument that Hunter Biden’s work w/ Burisma entirely appropriate & no conflict of interest w/ Joe Biden getting rid of prosecutor that had jurisdiction over Burisma,” Hawley said. “If we call witnesses, gonna need to hear from both Bidens.”\\nDemocrats spent most of Thursday homing in on the first impeachment article; specifically, abuse of power.\\xa0\\nNadler said Trump’s conduct “captures the worst fears of our Founders.”\\xa0\\n“Since President George Washington took office in 1789, no president has abused his power in this way,” he said. “Let me say that again: No president has ever used his office to compel a foreign nation to help him cheat in our elections. Prior presidents would be shocked to the core by such conduct.”\\nTrump has made frequent references to his record, reaching all the way back to George Washington, albeit typically in a more favorable way.\\xa0\\nA July 25 phone conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy led to the Democrat-controlled House’s voting, without support from a single Republican, to impeach Trump for alleged abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.\\xa0\\nDuring their call, Trump and Zelenskyy referred to Hunter Biden’s highly paid role on the board of Burisma at a time when his father, then the vice president, was the Obama administration’s point man on Ukraine policy.\\xa0\\nAccording to a White House transcript of the call released by the president, Trump asked Zelenskyy “to look into” Joe Biden’s admission that he forced the firing of a Ukrainian state prosecutor—Shokin—who was investigating Burisma.\\n“This conduct is not ‘America First,’” Nadler said, taking a swipe at Trump’s 2016 campaign theme. “This conduct is Donald Trump first.”\\xa0\\nNadler followed with another presidential comparison.\\n“This presidential stonewalling of Congress is unprecedented in the 238-year history of our constitutional republic. It puts even President [Richard] Nixon to shame,” Nadler said. “Taken together, the articles and the evidence conclusively establish that President Trump has placed his own personal political interests first. He has placed them above our national security, above our free and fair elections, and above our system of checks and balances.”\\nNadler later defended the history of the term “abuse of power,” a charge often criticized as being too vague.\\n“All prior impeachment considered of high office have all included abuse of power,” Nadler said, and referred to the impeachment investigations of Presidents Andrew Johnson, Nixon, and Bill Clinton.\\xa0\\nHowever, even left-leaning CNN fact-checked that comment and noted that abuse of power was not one of the 11 impeachment articles against Johnson in 1868. The House Judiciary Committee passed three articles of impeachment against Nixon in 1974, one of which was abuse of power. Nixon resigned the presidency before the full House voted.\\xa0\\nThe House Judiciary Committee, then run by Republicans, voted out four articles of impeachment against Clinton, a Democrat, in 1998, which included one for abuse of power. The full House only approved two impeachment articles, rejecting the abuse of power charge. The Senate acquitted Clinton in a 1999 trial.\\nNadler focused heavily on what he called the “ABCs of impeachment.”\\xa0\\n“Abuse. Betrayal. Corruption. Here are each of the core offenses the Framers [of the Constitution] feared most,” Nadler said. “The president’s abuse of power, his betrayal of the national interest, and his corruption of our elections plainly qualify as great and dangerous offenses.”\\nNadler said Trump abused his power by using the clout of his office to “solicit and pressure Ukraine to meddle in our elections.”\\nRegarding betrayal, the New York Democrat said, “He betrayed vital national interests; specifically, our national security, by withholding diplomatic support and military aid from Ukraine even as it faced armed Russian aggression.”\\nRegarding corruption, Nadler said, “President Trump’s intent was to corrupt our elections to his personal political benefit.”\\n“Article One thus charges a high crime and misdemeanor that blends abuse of power, betrayal of the nation, and corruption in elections into a single, unforgivable scheme,” he said. “That is why this president must be removed from office, especially before he continues his effort to corrupt our next election.”\\nNadler explained that some Trump defenders note that neither article of impeachment is based on a criminal statute.\\xa0\\n“In a last-ditch legal defense of their client, the president’s lawyers argue that impeachment and removal are subject to statutory crimes or to offenses against established law, that the president cannot be impeached because he has not committed a crime,” he said. \\n“This view is completely wrong. It has no support in constitutional text and structure, original meaning, congressional presence, common sense, or the consensus of credible experts. In other words, it conflicts with every relevant consideration,” he continued.\\nDuring his presentation, Nadler showed video from one of Trump’s chief advocates, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and one of the president’s lawyers, Alan Dershowitz.\\xa0\\nAccording to several reports, Graham had left the Senate chamber before a 1999 video clip in which he was featured was displayed.\\xa0\\nThe clip showed Graham, then a member of the House, on the Senate floor, acting as a House manager in the Clinton impeachment trial, explaining what he thought a “high crime” was.\\xa0\\n“What’s a high crime? How about if an important person hurts somebody of low means? It’s not very scholarly, but I think it’s the truth. I think that’s what they meant by high crimes,” Graham said in the 1999 video. “Doesn’t even have to be a crime. It’s just when you start using your office, and you’re acting in a way that hurts people, you have committed a high crime,” Graham said in the clip.\\nNadler also showed a clip of Dershowitz.\\n“It certainly doesn’t have to be a crime,” Dershowitz said of impeachment. “If you have somebody who completely corrupts the office of president and who abuses trust and who poses great danger to our liberty, you don’t need a technical crime.”\\nRep. Val Demings, D-Fla., laid out the case about an alleged conspiracy by Trump’s inner circle and his personal lawyer, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, and Giuliani associate Lev Parnas, who was indicted and recently spoke out against Trump.\\xa0\\nShe attempted to play a recording of a voicemail between Giuliani and Parnas, but the audio didn’t work.\\xa0\\n“Well, I was going to say it’s difficult to hear, but I’m sure you cannot hear that at all,” Demings said.\\xa0\\n“According to phone records, Mr. Giuliani had a one-minute, 50-second call,” Demings, a former Orlando, Florida, police chief said. “Fifteen minutes after they hung up, the records also show that Mr. Giuliani placed three short phone calls to the White House. Shortly thereafter, the White House called Giuliani back. Giuliani spoke with someone at the White House for eight minutes and 28 seconds.\\xa0\\n“I will just quickly note that at the time … the Intelligence Committee issued its report in mid-December, we did not know that eight-minute, 28-second call was from the White House.”\\nShe said neither the White House nor Giuliani provided a recording or transcript of the call.\\xa0\\nDemings said that Trump recalled Marie Yovanovitch from her job as ambassador to Ukraine out of fear that Yovanovitch, a holdover from the Obama administration, would stop the investigations of the Bidens and into suspected Ukraine election meddling in 2016.\\xa0\\nYovanovitch remains employed with the State Department at no change in pay and teaches at Georgetown University. But Demings said the ambassador’s removal created uncertainty among U.S. diplomats and State Department officials.\\xa0\\n“So, why did President Trump remove a distinguished career public servant and an anti-corruption crusader and a top diplomat in the State Department?” she asked rhetorically.\\xa0\\n“We know why. The answer is simple. President Trump removed Ambassador Yovanovitch because she was in the way,” Demings said. “She was in the way of the sham investigations that he so desperately wanted. Investigations that would hurt former Vice President Biden and undermine the Mueller investigation into Russia election interference, investigations that would help him cheat in the 2020 election.”',\n",
       " '“Every witness who was asked about Hunter Biden’s involvement with Burisma agreed there was a potential appearance of a conflict of interest,\" argues Pam Bondi, a member of President Donald Trump\\'s legal team, pictured arriving Monday for the Senate impeachment trial. (Photo: Andrew Caballero/AFP/Getty Images)\\nPresident Donald Trump’s lawyers hit the Senate floor Monday for the second day of defense arguments in his impeachment trial, amid what Democrats called a bombshell from a forthcoming book by the president’s former national security adviser, John Bolton.\\xa0\\nThe Bolton book wasn’t a direct topic during the arguments. But the president’s lawyers addressed the underlying allegation that Trump withheld military aid from Ukraine for weeks to pressure the former Soviet republic to investigate dealings there by former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe president’s lawyers also made their strongest case yet as to why Trump had reason to inquire about the Bidens and Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company where the younger Biden had a lucrative job from 2014 to 2019.\\xa0\\nDemocrats’ allegation that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy by putting a hold on the $391 million in aid was the basis for the House’s Dec. 18 impeachment of the president on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress—neither of which is a federal crime.\\xa0\\nHere are highlights from the sixth full day of the Senate impeachment trial, in which House Democrats are asking the Senate to convict Trump and remove him from office.\\xa0\\nThe New York Times reported Sunday that Bolton’s upcoming book will say Trump told his national security adviser that he would keep a hold on military aid to Ukraine until that country investigated the Bidens’ dealings there.\\xa0\\nPortions of the Bolton book apparently were leaked to the Times. The White House has had a copy of the book since Dec. 30 for a national security review and clearance.\\xa0\\nTitled “The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir,” the book is set to be released March 17.\\nTrump responded shortly after midnight on Twitter, asserting at one point early Monday: “I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens. In fact, he never complained about this at the time of his very public termination. If John Bolton said this, it was only to sell a book.”\\nI NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens.

I also allowed Ukraine to purchase Javelin anti-tank missiles. My Administration has done far more than the previous Administration.\\nSenate Minority Leader Charles Schumer had a far different take Monday morning, before the Senate convened for the impeachment trial at 1 p.m.\\n“This is stunning. It goes right to the charges against the president. Ambassador Bolton essentially confirms the president committed the offenses charged in the first article of impeachment,” Schumer told reporters, adding:\\nIt boils down to one thing. We have first-hand evidence of the president’s actions for which he is on trial. [Bolton] is ready and willing to testify. How can Senate Republicans not vote to call that witness and request his documents? Anyone, anyone who says the House case lacks witnesses and then votes to prevent eyewitnesses from testifying is talking out of both sides of their mouth.\\nSchumer said the excerpt of Bolton’s book is evidence of a widespread cover-up and shows the need to call acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney as a witness at the impeachment trial.\\n“There seems to be a giant cover-up among so many of the leading people in the White House who knew and said nothing about it, let alone tried to stop it,” Schumer said, later adding: “If Senate Republicans are not going to vote to call Mr. Bolton and Mr. Mulvaney and the other witnesses now, if they are not going to ask for notes and emails, they are going to be part of the cover-up too. We have this out in the open. It’s up to just four Senate Republicans [to join Democrats in voting to hear from witnesses].”\\nA few minutes later, during an arrival ceremony Monday for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House South Portico, Trump took a question about whether the manuscript of Bolton’s book would make it more likely his former national security adviser would testify to the Senate.\\xa0\\n“I haven’t seen the manuscript, but I can tell you nothing was ever said to John Bolton.” Trump said. “But I have not seen a manuscript.”\\nRep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, told reporters that the Senate shouldn’t be distracted from the defense of the president being presented Monday.\\xa0\\n“Do not get distracted by the shiny objects of saying ‘We need witnesses’ or Bolton’s new manuscript or anything else,” Collins said. “Don’t lose sight of the fact that the facts haven’t changed.”\\nThe Senate is expected to vote on witnesses Friday.\\xa0\\nThe president’s lawyers hit back\\nboth directly and indirectly on the Bolton manuscript.\\xa0\\n“Nothing in the Bolton manuscript\\nwould rise to the level of an abuse of power or impeachable offense,” said Alan\\nDershowitz, a Harvard law professor and Democrat who voted for Hillary Clinton\\nin 2016, but is now part of the Trump legal team.\\xa0\\n“That is clear from the history, that is clear from the language of the Constitution,” Dershowitz said, adding: \\nYou cannot turn conduct that is not impeachment into impeachable conduct simply by using words like quid pro quo and personal benefit. It is inconceivable that the framers [of the Constitution] would have intended so politically loaded and promiscuously deployed a term as ‘abuse of power’ to be weaponized as a tool of impeachment. It is precisely the kind of vague, open-ended, and suggestive term that the framers feared and rejected.\\nOther lawyers tackled the underlying allegation that Trump wanted Ukraine to investigate the Bidens—as well as possible Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. election—in exchange for getting the $391 million in congressionally approved security assistance.\\n“The president wasn’t ‘caught,’ as the House managers allege. The managers are wrong,” deputy White House counsel Mike Purpura said. “All of this, together with what we discussed on Saturday, demonstrates that there was no connection between security assistance and investigations.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nThis assertion appeared to take on directly news reports of what a section of the Bolton book will say.\\xa0\\nTrump’s personal lawyer, Jay Sekulow, didn’t address the Bolton book at all when he took the microphone. But he did argue that Trump was acting within his rights as president.\\xa0\\n“It is our position as president’s counsel that the president was at all times acting under his constitutional authority, under his legal authority, in the national interests pursuant to his oath of office,” Sekulow told senators.\\xa0 \\n“Asking a foreign leader to get to the bottom of issues of corruption is not a violation of an oath,” he said.\\nFormer Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, now on Trump’s defense team, laid out a timeline for potential conflicts of interest entangling Joe Biden, who oversaw the Obama administration’s Ukraine policy, and his son, Hunter Biden, who held a lucrative seat on the board of Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company.\\n“The United Kingdom’s Serious Frauds Office opens a money laundering investigation into the oligarch [Mykola] Zlochevsky and his company, Burisma,” Bondi said. “The very next month, April 2014, according to a public report, Hunter Biden quietly joints the board of Burisma. Remember, early 2014 was when Vice President Biden began leading Ukraine policy.”\\nBondi noted that public records show the younger Biden’s business partner Devon Archer, also a Burisma board member, met with the elder Biden at the White House two days before the company announced Hunter Biden had joined the board.\\n“Not even 10 days after Hunter Biden joins the board, British authorities seize $23 million in British bank accounts connected to the oligarch Zlochevsky, the owner of Burisma,” she said, adding:\\nDid Hunter Biden leave the board then? No. The British authorities had also announced that it had started a criminal investigation into potential money laundering. Then, only then, did the company choose to announce that Hunter Biden had joined the board.\\nIn 2016, Biden, as vice president, threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid from Ukraine unless the Eastern European nation fired Viktor Shokin, the state prosecutor who was investigating Burisma while Biden’s son was on the board.\\nBondi noted that news coverage of the appearance of a conflict over the younger Biden’s employment in Ukraine began to pop up in 2014. She read from news clips from The Washington Post, The New York Times, and The New Yorker, and showed part of a story from ABC News about Hunter Biden’s seat on the Burisma board.\\nHunter Biden, Bondi said, was paid “significantly more” than most members of corporate boards before leaving Burisma in October 2019.\\n“Hunter Biden [was] paid over $83,000 a month, while the average American family of four during that time each year made less than $54,000,” Bondi said, adding:\\nHunter Biden had no experience in natural gas, no experience in the energy sector, no experience with Ukrainian regulatory affairs. As far as we know, he doesn’t speak Ukrainian. So naturally, the media has asked questions about his board membership.\\nBondi also showed a clip of Obama press secretary Jay Carney getting a question about Hunter Biden’s role on the Burisma board, and a later clip of the younger Biden being asked in a TV interview whether he would have gotten the job on the board if his last name weren’t Biden. “I don’t know, probably not,” he responds.\\nBondi referred to the House Intelligence Committee’s\\xa0impeachment hearings, which Rep. Adam Schiff, one of the House impeachment managers, chaired.\\n“Every witness who was asked about Hunter Biden’s involvement with Burisma agreed there was a potential appearance of a conflict of interest,” she said.\\xa0\\nShe read the portion of the official transcript of the Trump-Zelenskyy call that pertained to the Bidens. She then referred to House prosecutors’ claim that any suspicions about the Bidens and Burisma had been “debunked.”\\n“The House managers talked about 400 times, but they never gave you the full picture,” Bondi said, adding:\\nHere are those who did: The United Kingdom Serious Fraud Unit, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent … “ABC Good Morning America,” The Washington Post, The New York Times, Ukrainian law enforcement, and the Obama State Department itself. They all thought there was cause to raise the issue about the Bidens and Burisma. …\\nYou’ve heard from the House managers. They do not believe that there was any concern to raise here, that all of this was baseless. All we are saying is that there was a basis to talk about this, to raise this issue, and that was enough.\\nEric Herschmann, one of Trump’s private lawyers on the team, also questioned whether impeachment was a means to distract from the Biden conflict.\\xa0\\nThe House managers say that President Zelenskyy did not want to get mixed up in U.S. politics, but it precisely the Democrats who politicized the issue. Last August, they began circling the wagons trying to protect Vice President Biden and they are still doing it in these proceedings. They contend that any investigation into the millions of dollars in payments by a corrupt Ukraine company, owned by a corrupt Ukraine oligarch, to the son of the second highest officeholder in our land, who was supposed to be in charge of fighting corruption in Ukraine, they are calling that kind of inquiry a sham, debunked. But there has never been an investigation. So how can it be a sham? Simply because the House managers say so?\\nIn September, at the first public hearing on the Ukraine matter, Schiff, D-Calif., who is leading the House impeachment managers, mischaracterized the Trump-Zelenskyy phone call and when criticized for it, called it a parody.\\nDuring his presentation to the Senate, Herschmann was not going to let the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee off easily.\\n“Remember the fake transcript that manager Schiff read when he was before the Intelligence Committee?” Herschmann asked seantors. “His mob, gangster-like fake rendition of the call?”\\n“Well, I’ve prosecuted organized crime for years,” Herschmann said. “The type of description of what goes on, what House manager Schiff tried to create for the American people, is completely detached from reality.”\\nHe continued:\\nIt is as if we are to believe that mobsters would invite people they do not know into an organized crime meeting to sit around and take notes to establish the corrupt intent. Manager Schiff, our jobs as prosecutors—I know you were one—would have been a lot easier if that were how it worked.\\nThink about what he is saying. Think about the managers’ position. That our president decided with corrupt intent to shake down—in their words—another foreign leader. And he decided to do it in front of everyone in a documented conversation in the presence of people he didn’t even know just so he could get this personal benefit that was not in our country’s best interest.\\nThe logic is flawed. It is completely illogical, because that is not what happened.\\nThat is why manager Schiff ran away from the actual transcript. That is why he created his own fake conversation.\\nKen Starr, whose investigation as independent counsel led to the 1998 impeachment of President Bill Clinton, gave a mixture of a law professor’s lecture and a warning of what the power of impeachment has wrought.\\xa0\\n“Like war, impeachment is hell, or at least presidential impeachment is hell,” Starr told senators, sitting as jurors in the trial.\\xa0\\nStarr noted that this was not the first House resolution of impeachment against Trump, only the first to pass.\\xa0\\nRep. Al Green, D-Texas, pushed three impeachment resolutions to a floor vote, all of which were defeated. Other Democrats pushed an impeachment resolution that never came to a vote.\\xa0\\nRep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., began in 2017 to promote the “Impeach 45” movement.\\xa0\\nMost of the seven House impeachment managers, or prosecutors, supported either impeaching Trump or beginning an impeachment inquiry against him long before the call with Ukraine’s leader that prompted the current case.\\n“We are living in what can aptly be described as the age of impeachment,” Starr said, adding:\\nIn the House, resolution after resolution, month after month, has called for the president’s impeachment. How did we get here? With presidential impeachment invoked frequently in its inherently destabilizing as well as acrimonious way.\\nPresidential impeachment has become a weapon to be wielded against one’s political opponent.\\nStarr said impeachment should be a “very important protection against serious wrongdoing.”\\nDespite having brought the case against Clinton that led to his acquittal, Starr said: “Presidents are to serve out their terms unless there is a national consensus for their removal.”\\nIn 1998, Starr was operating under the now-expired independent counsel law that required the prosecutor to submit a report to Congress.\\xa0\\nDuring his impeachment trial, Clinton was in his second term as president with another two years remaining, and would not face voters again for that office. By contrast,\\xa0 voters can hold Trump accountable when he seeks reelection in November 2020.\\xa0\\n“There is a huge prudential factor that this trial is occurring in an election year, when we the people in a matter of months will go to the polls,” Starr said.\\xa0\\nBoth of the articles of impeachment against Trump, he said, are “dripping with process violations” in the House’s case.\\xa0\\nStarr said the type of case the House has brought against Trump would be thrown out of court.\\xa0\\n“The Constitution speaks in terms of establishing justice. Courts would not allow this,” Starr said. “Because why? They knew and they know that the purpose of our founding instrument is to protect our founding liberties, to safeguard us as individuals against the powers of government.”\\xa0\\nStarr argued that the second article of impeachment, alleging obstruction of Congress, is evidence of a “runaway House.”\\n“If there is a dispute between the people’s House and the president of the United States over the availability of documents or witnesses, and there is in each and every administration—then go to court,” Starr said. “It really is as simple as that.”\\nBefore his legal team resumed its case Monday morning, Trump sent several tweets. But he mostly retweeted during the arguments.\\xa0\\nREAD THE TRANSCRIPTS!\\nAt one point, Trump inquired why Schiff, who is leading the impeachment managers, hasn’t made public the full transcript of testimony by Michael Atkinson, the intelligence community’s inspector general, to the House Intelligence Committee behind closed doors.\\xa0\\nAtkinson took the anonymous whistleblower’s complaint that arose out of Trump’s July 25 phone call to Ukraine’s president.\\xa0\\nSchiff must release the IG report, without changes or tampering, which is said to be yet further exoneration of the Impeachment Hoax. He refuses to give it. Does it link him to Whistleblower?

Zoe Lofgren, Adam Schiff, Jerry Nadler, Hakeem Jeffries, and Jason Crow speak to reporters briefly Tuesday before the start of the Senate's impeachment trial. (Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\\nThree of the House Democrats prosecuting President Donald Trump in the Senate’s impeachment trial—Jerry Nadler of New York, Zoe Lofgren of California, and Sylvia Garcia of Texas—are among lawmakers who voted last year to advance the president’s removal.\\nEight days after that vote, Trump talked by phone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the July 25 call in which the leaders discussed former Vice President Joe Biden and his son’s highly paid role on the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma.\\nThat conversation was the basis for House Democrats’ formal inquiry leading to Trump’s impeachment.\\nOn July 17, however, Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, had brought his third impeachment resolution to the House floor, forcing a procedural vote on articles of impeachment against Trump for disparaging “the squad,” the name for a group of four progressive House freshmen. \\nThe vote was on whether to allow debate or to table the resolution.\\xa0The motion failed, with 332 lawmakers voting to table the matter—in other words, against impeachment.\\n But 95 Democrats—the highest pro-impeachment tally to that point—voted against tabling Green’s resolution.\\xa0\\nNadler, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, explained at the time that he wanted to keep options open.\\xa0\\n“I opposed this procedural motion because this article of impeachment should have been referred to the House Judiciary Committee,” Nadler said. “My hope is that future impeachment resolutions be referred here as well, so that they can also be considered as part of the committee’s overall response to clear allegations of presidential misconduct.”\\xa0\\nThe Senate trial of Trump began Tuesday based on two articles of impeachment, passed by the House in December and accusing him of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Nadler and the other six House managers, or prosecutors, and the president’s lawyers debated the rules of the trial going forward.\\xa0\\nThe House’s Dec. 18 votes to impeach Trump on two charges, taken together, represented the fourth overall impeachment resolution taken up by the full House in some form.\\xa0\\nOther House managers spoke in favor of an impeachment inquiry.\\xa0\\nNadler voted to table Green’s two previous resolutions.\\nFour other House managers—House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff of California and Reps. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, Val Demings of Florida, and Jason Crow of Colorado—voted in July to table Green’s resolution.\\xa0\\nWell before the anonymous whistleblower complaint arising from the Trump-Zelenskyy phone call, Crow wrote a piece for Medium calling for an impeachment inquiry and saying:\\xa0\\nI didn’t run for office because I dislike Donald Trump. I ran because I love our country. It’s that same pride in our democracy and respect for our Constitution that fuels my support for an impeachment inquiry. We must complete the work started by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. It’s a solemn responsibility of Congress that the Framers of our Constitution included to protect the rule-of-law.\\nGreen previously forced a procedural floor vote in December 2017 on a resolution accusing Trump of “inciting hatred and hostility.”\\xa0\\nOnly 58 Democrats backed this first impeachment resolution in a floor vote, and none of the seven House impeachment managers were among them.\\xa0\\nLong before House Democrats drafted the two articles of impeachment against Trump for “abuse of power” and “obstruction of Congress,” neither of which is a criminal statute, Green argued that evidence of a crime is not necessary to impeach a president.\\xa0\\nDemings didn’t vote for any of the Green resolutions. But shortly after release of the Mueller report in April 2019 and long before the Ukraine controversy emerged, she expressed impatience with the slow pace and frustration with Mueller.\\xa0\\n“We are struggling to justify why we aren’t beginning impeachment proceedings,” said Demings, former police chief of Orlando, Florida, according to Politico. “As a 27-year law enforcement officer, and while I understand we need to see the full report and all supporting documents, I believe we have enough evidence now.”\\n“Mueller didn’t do us any favors,” Demings added, claiming the special counsel only “left us bread crumbs to follow.”\\nOn May 21, Demings said on CNN: “I just believe we are at the point of opening impeachment proceedings.”\\nThe bulk of arguments Tuesday revolved around whether the Senate would allow witness testimony and the gathering of new documents.\\xa0\\nBy late afternoon, the Senate voted along party lines, 53 Republicans to 47 Democrats, to reject an amendment by Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., to subpoena White House documents and witnesses for the trial.\\xa0\\nDemocrats had rushed the articles of impeachment through the House and now are calling to slow down the Senate trial, said Marc Short, chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence.\\xa0\\n“We find enormous hypocrisy that in the House Intelligence Committee, we went through a process in which this White House was denied the opportunity to have counsel present, denied the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses, [and] denied the opportunity to bring their own witnesses, all because we were told this has to be rushed through as quickly as possible,” Short told reporters Tuesday at the White House.\\xa0\\n“Yet, what you hear from [Democrats] today is that Senate Republicans are moving too quickly, we have to slow down,” Short said. “Obviously there is enormous hypocrisy. The American people see that. They are ready for this chapter to be over.”\",\n",

Other House Democrats acting as prosecutors, from left: Jason Crow of Colorado; Sylvia Garcia of Texas;  Zoe Lofgren of California; and Jerrold Nadler and Hakeem Jeffries, both of New York. (Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\\nHouse prosecutors claimed Wednesday that President Donald Trump is trying to “cheat” to win the 2020 election, as opening arguments from each side commenced in the Senate impeachment trial of the president.\\xa0\\nThe seven House Democrats who are impeachment managers, acting as prosecutors, made their case against Trump. They include House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff of California and House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler of New York.\\nPresenting the other side was the president’s legal defense team, which includes White House counsel Pat Cipollone; Trump’s personal lawyer, Jay Sekulow; and former independent counsel Ken Starr.\\nUnder rules approved late Tuesday, each side has a total of 24 hours of speaking time on the Senate floor to make their case, a time allotment that may be spread over three days.\\xa0\\nAfter each side presents its case, the Senate will vote on whether to call witnesses to testify. The rules are similar to those used in the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton, who was acquitted.\\xa0\\nIt takes a two-thirds vote, or 67 senators, to remove a president from office.\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor now, the seven House impeachment managers have up to 24 hours over three days to persuade senators to convict Trump and remove him from office.\\xa0\\nSchiff opened the proceedings with a presentation lasting more than two hours. He used video and text messages to support his case, including 2016 campaign footage and clips from sworn witnesses at the House impeachment hearings in November.\\xa0\\nHere are five dramatic scenes from the second full day of the Senate impeachment trial, which began shortly after 1 p.m. and continued into the night.\\xa0\\nA July 25 phone conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy led to the Democrat-controlled House’s voting, without support from a single Republican, to impeach Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.\\xa0\\nDuring their call,\\xa0Trump and Zelenskyy referred to Hunter Biden’s highly paid role on the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma at a time when his father, then-Vice President Joe Biden, was the Obama administration’s point man on Ukraine policy.\\xa0\\nAccording to a White House transcript of the call released by the president, Trump asked Zelenskyy “to look into” Joe Biden’s admission that he forced the firing of a Ukrainian state prosecutor who was investigating Burisma.\\nSchiff told the Senate, sitting as a jury, that impeachment and removal of Trump is not about a policy disagreement.\\xa0\\n“We are here today to consider a much more grave matter, and that is the attempt to use the power of the presidency to cheat in an election,” Schiff said.\\xa0\\nAhead of a presidential election in November, when Trump seeks a second term, Schiff rejected the notion that the matter should be left to voters.\\xa0\\n“The president’s misconduct cannot be decided at the ballot box,” Schiff said, adding:\\nFor we cannot be assured that the vote will be fairly won. In corruptly using his office to gain a political advantage and abusing that office in such a way to jeopardize that national security and the integrity of our elections, in obstructing the investigation into his own wrongdoing, the president has shown he believes that he is above the law and scornful of constraint.\\n\\n\\nAlthough one impeachment article alleges Trump was soliciting Ukraine to meddle in the 2020 election, the House impeachment managers brought up Russia again.\\nThis comes despite the conclusion by special counsel Robert Mueller’s team that neither Trump nor his campaign conspired with Russian government operatives to influence the 2016 election.\\xa0\\nBefore Schiff became chairman when Democrats reclaimed the House majority in the 2018 elections, the House Intelligence Committee reached a similar conclusion prior to release of the Mueller report.\\xa0\\nNevertheless, Schiff wasn’t ready to let the subject of Russia go.\\xa0\\n“This is not the first time the president solicited foreign interference in our elections,” Schiff said. “In 2016, then-candidate Trump implored Russia to hack his opponent’s email account—something the Russian military did only hours later. Only hours later.\\xa0\\n“When the president said, ‘Hey Russia, if you’re listening,’ they were listening. Only hours later, they hacked his opponent’s campaign.”\\nIn 2016, Trump’s Democratic rival for the presidency, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, was under FBI investigation for conducting State Department business over an unsecure private email server.\\xa0\\nWeeks after then-FBI Director James Comey announced that he wouldn’t recommend prosecution of Clinton, despite thousands of “missing” emails, Trump talked about the issue on the campaign trail.\\xa0\\nThis also came after news that Russia was believed to have hacked the Democratic National Committee.\\xa0\\n“If it is Russia, it’s really bad for a different reason,” Trump said at a rally on July 27, 2016. “Because it shows how little respect they have for our country when they would hack into a major party and get everything.”\\n“But it would be interesting to see—I will tell you this, Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,” Trump said. “I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. Let’s see if that happens. That will be next.”\\nLater in the House impeachment managers’ arguments in the Senate, a video clip showed a Trump interview with ABC News after the Mueller investigation concluded, in which Trump was asked if he would report to the FBI if Russia or China offered him negative information on his opponent, or would take the information.\\xa0\\n“I think maybe you do both,” Trump told the network in June. “I think you might want to listen; there isn’t anything wrong with listening. If somebody called from a country, Norway, [and said,] ‘We have information on your opponent’—oh, I think I’d want to hear it.”\\nArguing on the Senate floor, Rep. Sylvia Garcia, D-Texas, proclaimed of the clip: “Shocking video.”\\nTrump apparently weighed in on Schiff’s arguments from the economic conference he was attending in Davos, Switzerland. He took the time for a short tweet, in all capital letters: “NO PRESSURE.”\\n“NO PRESSURE”\\nThe president was making the point that he did not pressure Zelenskyy to conduct investigations of the Bidens and possible Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 election in order to get $391 million in congressional approved military aid.\\xa0\\nZelenskyy also has said repeatedly that there was no pressure from Trump.\\xa0\\nTrump defenders and independent legal analysts frequently note that after House Democrats failed in their effort to show Trump had engaged in bribery or extortion, they had to rely on vague charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress—neither of which are crimes in federal statutes.\\xa0\\nHowever, Schiff pointed to a Government Accountability Office opinion last week that said Trump violated a law called the\\xa0 Impoundment Control Act in delaying the congressionally approved assistance to Ukraine.\\xa0\\nThe California Democrat said the president’s lawyers “pooh-poohed” the GAO’s finding.\\xa0\\n“They are a nonpartisan organization that both parties have come to rely upon, but I’m not surprised they don’t like the conclusion of the GAO because the Defense Department warned them that this was going to be the conclusion,” Schiff said. “And that conclusion was that a hold on aid was not only wrong, it was not only immoral, it was also illegal.”\\nThe GAO provided a legal opinion, not a legally adjudicated decision, and the White House Office of Management and Budget disputed the finding.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe 1974 Impoundment Control Act provides the executive branch only narrow and limited discretion in spending money appropriated by Congress and signed into law by the president in the budget process.\\xa0\\n“It violated the law, a law that we passed, so that presidents could not refuse to spend money that we allocated for the defense of others and for ourselves,” Schiff said.\\xa0\\nThe GAO and a federal court determined that President Barack Obama violated certain laws regarding congressionally approved expenditures, The Wall Street Journal noted.\\xa0\\nSenate Democrats spent most of Tuesday asserting that they were committed to having witnesses testify in the Senate trial. However, before the trial began Wednesday afternoon, Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., threw that desire into question.\\nDuring a press conference, Schumer was asked about a possible deal to have testimony from Trump’s former national security adviser, John Bolton, in exchange for testimony from Hunter Biden about his lucrative board position with Burisma Holdings, the Ukrainian energy company, while his father was vice president and Obama’s point man on Ukraine policy.\\n“That trade is not on the table,” Schumer told reporters. “This isn’t like some fantasy football trade. Trials aren’t trades for witnesses.”\\nViktor Shokin, then Ukraine’s prosecutor general, was investigating Burisma in 2016, when Biden visited the country.\\nBiden boasted on camera at a 2018 event that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees to Ukraine unless the government fired Shokin. He was fired.\\xa0\\nBiden defenders say his threat had nothing to do with the Burisma probe.\\nNadler delivered a strong defense of the former vice president on the Senate floor.\\n“It is true that Vice President Biden helped remove Mr. Shokin, who was widely believed to be corrupt,” Nadler said, adding:\\nIt was official policy of the United States, the European community, and others—in order to fight corruption in Ukraine—to ask that Shokin and [former Ukraine prosecutor Yuriy] Lutsenko be removed. So Vice President Biden, in fulfilling U.S. policy, pressured Ukraine to remove Shokin, not to secure some personal benefit, but to advance the official policy of the United States and its allies.\\nNadler invoked the Watergate scandal that enveloped President Richard Nixon as he talked about Trump personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor, who pursued the president’s interest in investigations in Ukraine.\\xa0\\n“Who benefited from this scheme? Who sent Mr. Giuliani to Ukraine in the first place?” Nadler said.\\xa0\\n“Of course, we could rephrase that question, as the former Republican leader of the Senate, Howard Baker, asked it in 1973: What did the president know and when did he know it?”\\nKen McIntyre contributed to this report.

Then we had the case of the Democrat governor in the state of Virginia. … The governor stated he would execute a baby after birth.\\nTrump was referring to Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat. Appearing on a talk radio show in early 2019, Northam said: “If a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.”\\xa0\\nTrump praised those in attendance for their activism.\\xa0\\n“Young people are the heart of the March for Life. It is your generation that is making America a pro-family, pro-life country,” Trump said, adding:\\nThe life movement is led by strong women, amazing faith leaders, and brave students who carry on the legacy of pioneers before us to raise the conscience of a nation and uphold the rights of our citizens.

The agreement, he said, will require that Palestinians “reject terrorism.”\\nPalestianian officials have not endorsed the plan, but Trump said the U.S. will promote negotiations.\\xa0\\n“We have an obligation to humanity to get it done,” Trump said.\\nNetanyahu and his chief rival in the Israeli election, Benny Gantz, both visited Trump and endorsed the plan that the president has said would be the “deal of the century.”\\xa0\\n“You have been the greatest friend that Israel has ever had in the White House,” Netanyahu said to Trump when he took the podium. “Frankly, though we’ve had some great, outstanding friends in these halls, it’s not even close.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAs the two leaders spoke, drawing repeated applause from the audience, both face removal from office amid intense political challenges—Trump an impeachment trial in the Senate and Netanyahu an indictment in three corruption cases.\\xa0\\nTrump referred to the U.S. Embassy having been relocated from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem on his watch.\\xa0\\n“Under this vision, Jerusalem will remain Israel’s undivided—very important—undivided capital,” Trump said. “But that’s no big deal, because I’ve already done that for you, right?”\\nTrump said he wants a strong deal for the Palestinians.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“Our vision will deliver massive commercial investment of $50 billion into the new Palestinian state,” Trump said.\\nOne million jobs would be created for the Palestinians and their poverty rate would be cut in half, the president said.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“I was saddened by the fate of the Palestinian people.

Adam Schiff and Zoe Lofgren, both California Democrats, at the Capitol before the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump continues Friday. (Photo: Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call/Getty Images)\\nIn their final day of arguments that the Senate should remove President Donald Trump from office, House Democrats questioned the president’s character and defended former Vice President Joe Biden.\\xa0\\nThe seven House Democrats who are impeachment managers, acting as prosecutors, used just over 21 of their allotted 24 hours before concluding their third day of arguments on the Senate floor.\\xa0\\xa0The Senate adjourned just before 9 p.m.\\nTrump’s legal defense team is scheduled to begin counterarguments Saturday at 10 a.m., but is expected to use only a few hours of the allotted 24 hours and to continue Monday.  The team includes White House counsel Pat Cipollone; Trump personal lawyer Jay Sekulow; constitutional lawyer Alan Dershowitz; and former independent counsel Ken Starr.\\nAfter each side presents its case, the Senate will vote on whether to call witnesses to testify. It takes a two-thirds majority, or 67 senators, to remove a president from office.\\xa0\\nHere are highlights from Day 3 of the Democrats’ arguments:\\xa0\\nRep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., leader of the House managers, made an impassioned plea to the senators to put themselves “in someone else’s shoes,” in this case, those of Joe Biden.\\xa0\\n“Let’s imagine it wasn’t Joe Biden. Let’s imagine it was anyone of us,” Schiff said, adding:\\nLet’s imagine the most powerful person in the world was asking a foreign nation to conduct a sham investigation into one of us.\\nWhat would we think about it then? Would we think that’s a good U.S. policy? Would we think he has every right to do it? Would we think that’s a ‘perfect’ call?\\nIn 2016, Biden, as vice president, threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid from Ukraine unless the Eastern European nation fired Viktor Shokin, the state prosecutor who was investigating the Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings.\\xa0\\nHunter Biden, the vice president’s son, held a high-paying job on the board of Burisma at the same time his father was the Obama administration’s point man for Ukraine policy.\\xa0\\nIn a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the two men briefly discussed Trump’s interest in Ukraine’s investigating the matter along with Ukraine’s possible meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.\\nAt the time, unknown to Zelenskyy, Trump had put a hold on $391 million in congressionally approved military aid to Ukraine to counter Russian aggression, which he would lift in September.\\nBoth presidents say there was no pressure on Ukraine to begin investigations.\\xa0\\nDuring his argument Friday on the Senate floor, Schiff brought up former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who Trump recalled to the United States on May 20, the day of Zelenskyy’s inauguration. Yovanovitch continues to work for the State Department.\\xa0\\n“Would you think he [Trump] was abusing the power of his office? And if you would, it shouldn’t matter that it wasn’t you,” Schiff continued. “It shouldn’t matter that it was Marie Yovanovitch. It shouldn’t matter that it was Joe Biden. Because I’ll tell you something; The next time, it just may be you.”\\nSchiff warned that Trump likely wouldn’t be loyal to his own Republican allies in the Senate if it didn’t benefit him.\\xa0\\n“Do you think for a moment, no matter what your relationship with this president, no matter how close you are to this president, do you think for a moment that if he felt it was in his interest, he wouldn’t ask you to be investigated?” Schiff said.\\xa0\\n“If somewhere deep down below, you realize that he would, you cannot leave a man like that in office when he has violated the Constitution. It shouldn’t matter that it was Joe Biden. It could have been any of us. It may be any of us,” he said.\\xa0\\nSchiff later added, referring to the elder Biden: “Yes, he’s running for president. He’s still a U.S. citizen, and he deserves better than that.”\\xa0\\nRep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said Trump’s conduct represented an assault on the character of the country.\\xa0\\n“There’s a toxic mess at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, and I humbly suggest that it’s our collective job on behalf of the American people to try to clean it up,” Jeffries said. “President Trump tried to cheat. He got caught, and then he worked hard to cover it up.”\\nJeffries went so far as to talk about impeachment in the context of the Civil War, the Great Depression, World War II, the Jim Crow era, and the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\\n“America is a great country. We can handle adversity better than any other nation in the world, but what are we going to do about our character?” Jeffries asked, adding:\\nPresident Trump tried to cheat and solicit foreign interference in an American election. That is an attack on our character.\\nPresident Trump abused his power and corrupted the highest office in the land. That is an attack on our character.\\nPresident Trump tried to cover it all up and hide it from the American people and obstruct Congress. That’s an extraordinary attack on our character.\\nSchiff later made a similar point.\\xa0\\n“You don’t realize how important character is in the highest office in the land until you don’t have it, until you have a president willing to use his power to coerce an ally to help him cheat, to investigate one of our fellow citizens,” Schiff said.\\xa0\\nRep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., an impeachment manager who is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, called Trump “a dictator” who must be removed for not cooperating with the House’s impeachment inquiry.\\xa0\\n“President Trump is an outlier. He’s the first and only president to declare himself unaccountable and to ignore subpoenas backed by the Constitution’s impeachment power,” Nadler said, adding:\\nIf he is not removed from office, if he is permitted to defy the Congress entirely, categorically, to say that subpoenas from Congress in an impeachment inquiry are nonsense, then we will have lost, the House will have lost, the Senate certainly will have lost, all power to hold any president accountable.\\nNadler, not mentioning that House Democrats didn’t try to enforce their subpoenas through the courts, also said:\\xa0\\nThis is a determination by President Trump that he wants to be all powerful. He does not have to respect the Congress. He does not have to respect the representatives of the people. Only his will goes. He is a dictator. This must not stand. That is another reason he must be removed from office.\\nRep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., a former Army Ranger, pushed that military role in buttressing Democrats’ national security argument.\\xa0\\n“This defense would be laughable if this issue wasn’t so serious,” Crow said on the Senate floor, in anticipation of an argument the president’s lawyers will make. “No, the delay wasn’t meaningless. Just ask the Ukrainians sitting in trenches now.”\\nCrow suggested that former national security adviser John Bolton, who Democrats want as a witness in the trial, might have quit because of the hold on aid to Ukraine.\\xa0\\n“Ambassador Bolton could shed light on that himself if he were to testify,” Crow said.\\xa0\\nSchiff also noted, while on the Senate floor, the huge reliance Ukraine had on the United States, which provides 10% of the country’s military budget.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“Withholding aid has real consequences on real soldiers and their families,” Schiff said, adding the hold only “emboldened Russia.”\\nTrump ultimately followed through on military aid to Ukraine to defend itself from Russia, while President Barack Obama did not, Trump’s defenders note.\\xa0\\nChief Justice John Roberts is presiding over the trial, as is his constitutional duty. Going back to his confirmation hearing, Roberts generally has said he only calls balls and strikes.\\xa0\\nHowever, on Friday, Schiff broached the subject of having Roberts make the final decision on calling witnesses. Most reports indicate the 45 Senate Democrats and two independents will have a tough time getting four Republicans to join them for a majority to vote for calling witnesses.\\xa0\\nSchiff cited Senate precedent from the 1868 impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson, which ended in acquittal. In that trial, Chief Justice Salmon Chase cast a tie-breaking vote.\\xa0\\n“We have a very capable justice sitting in that Senate chamber empowered by the Senate rules to decide issues of evidence and privilege,” Schiff told reporters.\\xa0“So if any of these witnesses have a colorable claim that they wish to make or the president on their behalf, we have a justice that is able to make those determinations.”\\nCrow said he was anticipating the arguments of the president’s defense team, set to begin Saturday.\\xa0\\n“Now since we won’t have an opportunity to respond to the president’s presentation, I want to take a minute to respond to some of the arguments that I expect them to make,” Crow said.\\xa0\\nThe Colorado Democrat said the president’s lawyers likely will say that Ukraine eventually got the $391 million in security assistance from the U.S.\\xa0\\n“Regardless of whether the aid was ultimately released, the fact that the hold became public sent a very important signal to Russia that our support was wavering,” Crow said. “The damage was done.”\\nCrow warned senators that the Trump defense team will “cherry-pick” evidence and advised: “Don’t be fooled.”\\nUkraine received the $391 million in military aid only after news broke of a whistleblower complaint about the Trump-Zelenskyy phone call, he said.\\xa0\\n“The scheme was unraveling. He only released it after he got caught,” Crow said of Trump.\\xa0\\nSchiff dismissed the often-repeated line from Trump defenders that the president had sought to address corruption in Ukraine before delivering the aid.\\xa0\\n“He was not trying to end corruption in Ukraine,” Schiff said. “He was trying to aim corruption in Ukraine at Joe Biden.”\\n\\nTrump’s refusal to cooperate with impeachment investigators could set a dangerous precedent, Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., told senators, in arguing for removing the president from office for obstruction of Congress.\\xa0\\n“All presidents after him with have veto power over Congress’ ability to conduct oversight and the power of impeachment,” Lofgren said.\\n“The House was not prepared to accept that, and that’s why the House approved Article 2,” she said, referring to the House’s\\xa0second article of impeachment.\\xa0\\nLofgren was a member of the House Judiciary Committee during the 1998 impeachment hearings of President Bill Clinton and a congressional staffer during the 1974 impeachment inquiry of President Richard Nixon.\\xa0\\nOver two days of arguments, the seven House impeachment managers prosecuted the case for abuse of power against Trump. The first three hours of Friday’s proceedings closed out their arguments for that first article of impeachment.\\xa0\\nJust before 5 p.m., Democrats began arguing that the Senate should remove Trump from office for obstruction of Congress, charging that the president didn’t cooperate with the House’s impeachment investigation.\\xa0\\nThe House sent several subpoenas during the investigation. Cipollone, the White House counsel, wrote a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in October saying that the White House would not provide any documents or witnesses.\\xa0\\nThe letter asserted that the impeachment investigation was an attempt both to overturn the results of the 2016 election and to influence the outcome of the 2020 contest.\\nRepublicans, criticizing the second impeachment article, say House Democrats didn’t even attempt to enforce their subpoenas in court.\\xa0\\nThe House subpoenaed White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and various other officials, but not Bolton.\\xa0\\nStill, Lofgren accused Trump of ordering nine witnesses to defy House subpoenas.\\xa0\\n“In the history of our republic, no president ever dared to issue an order to prevent even a single government witness from testifying in an impeachment inquiry,” Lofgren said.\\xa0\\n“President Trump abused the power of his office by using his official power in an attempt to prevent every single person who works in the executive branch from testifying before the House,” she said.\\nIn fact, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, which led the investigation, identified 17 current and former Trump administration officials who either were deposed behind closed doors or gave public testimony.\\xa0\\nTrump made no attempt to cooperate with the House investigation, said Rep. Sylvia Garcia, D-Texas, a former state judge.\\xa0\\n“At President Trump’s order, agencies and offices refused to produce documents in response to the committee’s request,” Garcia said. “They refused to allow individual witnesses to do so either.”\\xa0\\n“So let’s recap. No documents. Zero, goose eggs, nada, in response to over 70 requests and five subpoenas.”\\nGarcia continued:\\xa0\\nNo attempt to negotiate. No genuine attempt to accommodate. Categorial, indiscriminate, and unprecedented stonewalling. Again, never in my time as a lawyer or as a judge have I seen this kind of total disrespect and defiance of a lawfully issued subpoena, and all on President Trump’s orders.\\nThis report was updated to include later developments.',\n",
       " \"Jay Sekulow, personal lawyer to President Donald Trump, arrives Saturday morning for the defense's opening arguments in the Senate impeachment trial.  At far left is  White House counsel Pat Cipollone. (Photo: Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call/Getty Images)\\nPresident Donald Trump’s lawyers took the Senate floor Saturday morning to open their defense in his impeachment trial, wrapping up their initial arguments within two hours.\\nThe defense’s opening presentation was unusually brief after House Democrats’ impeachment managers stretched their arguments for about eight hours on each of three days.\\xa0\\nTrump’s lawyers have Monday and Tuesday to finish their defense, as each side gets three days and up to 24 hours to make their cases to senators. The House’s seven impeachment managers, urging the Senate to remove Trump from office, used all but about three hours of their allotted time.\\xa0\\nTrump weighed in on Twitter well after the Senate adjourned shortly after noon. \\xa0\\nAny fair minded person watching the Senate trial today would be able to see how unfairly I have been treated and that this is indeed the totally partisan Impeachment Hoax that EVERYBODY, including the Democrats, truly knows it is. This should never be allowed to happen again!\\nHere are five highlights from the opening arguments of the president’s lawyers.\\xa0\\nThe Democrat-controlled House voted Dec. 18 to impeach Trump, alleging he abused his power and obstructed Congress in connection with his July 25 phone call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\\nIn the call, the two men briefly discussed Trump’s interest in Zelenskyy’s investigating possible Ukrainian interference in the U.S. presidential election in 2016 as well as Ukrainian-related actions taken by former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.\\nHouse Democrats allege that Trump used the power of his office to solicit Ukraine to interfere in the U.S. presidential election in 2020.\\xa0\\nWhite House counsel Pat Cipollone countered that it is Democrats’ impeachment effort that seeks to “perpetrate the most massive interference in an election in American history.”\\n“They’re asking you to remove President Trump from the ballot,” Cipollone said.\\nIf two-thirds of the Senate, or 67 senators, vote to remove a president from office, they also may disqualify him from holding another federal office.\\xa0\\n“They’re asking you to do something that no Senate has ever done, and they’re asking you to do that with no evidence, and that’s wrong,” Cipollone said.\\nCipollone said Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff of\\xa0California, Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler of New York, and the other five House impeachment managers “hid evidence” from the Senate.\\nThe White House counsel pointed to the official transcript of the Trump-Zelenskyy call, ordered released by the president, which shows that both leaders talked about “burden-sharing” in support of Ukraine by other European countries.\\xa0\\nCipollone said of the House managers:\\nThey come here to the Senate and they ask you [to] remove a president, tear up the ballots in all of your states, and they don’t bother to read the key evidence of the discussion of burden-sharing that’s in the call itself. Now, that’s emblematic of their entire presentation.\\nThey have the burden of proof. And they have not come close to meeting it.\\n\\nIn 2016, Biden, as vice president, threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid from Ukraine unless the Eastern European nation fired Viktor Shokin, the state prosecutor who was investigating the Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings.\\nHunter Biden, the vice president’s son, held a high-paying job on the board of Burisma at the same time his father was the Obama administration’s point man for Ukraine policy.\\nIn his July 25 phone call with Zelenskyy, Trump said he would appreciate Ukraine’s investigating the matter along with Ukraine’s possible meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.\\nAt the time, unknown to Zelenskyy, Trump had put a hold on $391 million in congressionally approved military aid to the former Soviet republic to counter Russian aggression, which he would lift in September.\\nDeputy White House counsel Mike Purpura said the entire case put forward by House impeachment managers melts under what he said were “six key facts”:\\nFirst, the transcript shows that the president did not condition either security assistance or a meeting on anything. Second, President Zelenskyy and other Ukrainian officials repeatedly have said there was no quid pro quo and no pressure on them to review anything.\\xa0\\nThird, President Zelenskyy and high-ranking Ukrainian officials did not even know the security assistance was paused until the end of August, over a month after the July 25 call.\\xa0\\nFourth, not a single witness testified that the president himself [Trump] said that there was any connection between any investigations in security assistance, a presidential meeting, or anything else.\\nFifth, the security assistance flowed on Sept. 11 and a presidential meeting took place on Sept. 25 [at the United Nations] without the Ukrainian government announcing any investigations.\\xa0\\nFinally, the Democrats’ blind drive to impeach the president does not and cannot change the fact, as attested to by the Democrats’ own witnesses, that President Trump has been a better friend and stronger supporter of Ukraine than his predecessor.\\nOn the last point, numerous witnesses who testified at the House impeachment hearings made clear that they supported the Trump administration’s policy of providing lethal weapons to Ukraine to defend itself from Russia.\\xa0\\nPresident Barack Obama’s administration had refused to provide such weaponry.\\nZelenskyy and his aides in Ukraine have said on several occasions that they did not believe the U.S. was pressuring them to begin investigations of Burisma and possible Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, which the president’s lawyers were eager to note.\\xa0\\n“Of course, the best evidence that there was no pressure or quid pro quo is the statements of Ukrainians themselves,” Purpura told senators. “The fact that President Zelenskyy himself felt no pressure on the call and did not perceive there to be any connection between security assistance and investigations would, in any ordinary case in any court, be totally fatal to the prosecution.”\\xa0\\n“The judge would throw it out,” he said. “The case would be over. What more do you need to know?”\\nDuring their arguments, House members had told senators that, because of a power disparity, it was highly unlikely that Zelensky would challenge an assertion by Trump.\\xa0\\nPurpura dismissed this idea Saturday.\\xa0\\n“How do they try to overcome the direct words from President Zelenskyy and his administration that they felt no pressure? They tell you that the Ukrainians must have felt pressure, regardless of what they said,” Purpura argued, adding:\\xa0\\nThey try to overcome the devastating evidence against them by apparently claiming to be mind readers. They know what’s in President Zelenskyy’s mind better than President Zelenskyy does. President Zelenskyy said he felt no pressure. The House managers tell you they know better.\\xa0\\nThis is really a theme of the House case. Every time the Democrats say that President Trump made demands or issued a quid pro quo to Zelenskyy on the July 25 call, they are saying that President Zelenskyy and his top advisers are being untruthful.\\nJay Sekulow, one of Trump’s personal lawyers, later followed with a similar point about witnesses in the House impeachment hearings, most of whom declined to say, when asked, that they saw in the call a quid pro quo or a bribe.\\xa0\\n“This entire impeachment process is about the House managers’ insistence that they are able to read everybody’s thoughts; they can read everybody’s intentions, even when the principal speakers, the witnesses themselves, insist that those interpretations are wrong,” Sekulow said.\\xa0\\nHe said it is well known that Trump is suspicious of foreign aid, noting that the president also reviewed or held up aid to Afghanistan, South Korea, and Pakistan, among other nations.\\nThe president’s lawyers also asserted that Ukraine wasn’t aware that Trump had put a hold on the $391 million in military aid, and never broached the topic with U.S. officials until an Aug. 28 story appeared in Politico.\\xa0\\nThe article ran more than a month after the July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelenskyy.\\n“We know there was no quid pro quo on the call; we know that from the transcript,” Purpura said. “There couldn’t possibly have been a quid pro quo because the Ukrainians didn’t know the security assistance was on hold. … There can’t be a threat without the person knowing he’s being threatened.”\\nPurpura played video of Democrat-called witnesses telling House members that they did not believe the Ukrainian government was aware that the U.S. aid was being held up until the news story appeared in late August.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“The House managers are aware that the Ukrainians’ lack of knowledge on the hold is fatal to their case, so they desperately tried to muddy the water,” Purpura said.\\xa0\\nDuring their presentation to the Senate, House Democrats pointed to an October press conference in which acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said the administration held up the money in part because it wanted Ukraine to investigate interference in the 2016 election. Mulvaney said this concern didn’t include an investigation of the Bidens.\\xa0\\nResponding to Democrats’ repeated assertion that Trump wanted Zelenskyy to do him a favor, and pointing again to the official transcript of the call, Purpura said:\\nAs everyone knows by now, President Trump asked President Zelenskyy to do ‘us’ a favor. And he made clear that ‘us’ referred to our country, and not himself. … There was no mention of the paused security assistance on the call, and certainly not from President Trump.\\nDuring his closing argument late Friday, Schiff asserted that Trump thinks that “he is the state.”\\nSekulow, who also represented Trump in the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign, addressed another Schiff comment from Friday.\\xa0\\nSchiff asked senators to put themselves in the shoes of Joe Biden, and imagine that Trump had asked for Ukraine to investigate any one of them.\\xa0\\n“Let me begin by saying that you cannot simply decide this case in a vacuum,” Sekulow told senators. “Mr. Schiff said yesterday, I believe it was his father who [told him], you should put yourself in someone else’s shoes. Let’s for a moment put ourselves in the shoes of the president of the United States right now.”\\nAn FBI investigation of Trump for alleged conspiracy with Russia was underway before he was even elected, Sekulow said. Then, a few months into his presidency, Mueller was named as special counsel and investigated the Russian matter for about two years.\\xa0\\nSekulow read a portion of the Mueller report clearing Trump and his campaign of any conspiracy or coordination with Russia to influence the 2016 election.\\xa0\\n“In their opening statement, several of the House managers tried once again to relitigate the Mueller case,” he said.\\xa0\\nSekulow pointed out that the Mueller probe cost $32 million in taxpayers’ money and included 2,800 subpoenas, 500 search warrants, and 500 witness interviews.\\nThat investigation, he said, was predicated largely on what the Justice Department’s inspector general later determined to be a faulty FBI process of\\xa0 seeking a warrant to surveil a Trump campaign adviser, Carter Page.\\xa0\\n“The president had reason to be concerned about the information he was being provided,” Sekulow said, referring to the FBI and other intelligence agencies. “Now we can ignore this. We can make believe this did not happen. But it did.”\\nDemocrats were making a “straw man argument,” he said:\\nThe House managers over a 23-hour period kept pushing this false dichotomy that it was either Russia or Ukraine [that interfered in the 2016 election], but not both. They kept telling you the conclusion of the intelligence community and Mr. Mueller was Russia alone [meddled], with regard to the 2016 elections. The report Bob Mueller wrote was on Russia interference, although there is some information [there] in letters regarding Ukraine.\\nKen McIntyre contributed to this report. \",\n",

His latest book is \"A Pope and a President: John Paul II, Ronald Reagan, and the Extraordinary Untold Story of the 20th Century.\"\\nOn June 26, 2015, four of the Supreme Court’s liberals joined Justice Anthony Kennedy in discovering a new right to same-sex marriage in the U.S. Constitution, one thereby imposed upon all 50 states.\\nIn response, of course, liberals were jubilant. Their leader, the one who promised to fundamentally transform America, responded by literally illuminating the nation’s house in rainbow colors.\\nAmericans saw all of that. They saw the pictures of their fundamentally transformed White House; they saw other culture-transformers dancing in the streets joyously rejecting what a great country once called the laws of nature and nature’s God.\\nWhat they had just achieved was, obviously, something utterly untried and unprecedented. And yet, if you suggested even a slight pause before redefining something as fundamental as the 2,000-year, unquestioned, Judeo-Christian/Western standard for marriage, which has only ever meant a male-female bond—well, then you were nothing more than a homophobe exuding a noxious stream of hate. You couldn’t possibly have any rational reason for your rancid, puzzling position.\\nThe Push to Alter Marriage\\nBut one thing that very few Americans saw, including the millions of same-sex marriage supporters who aren’t especially political or ideological, was the quite revealing celebration among some really radical quarters.\\nAmong them, Communist Party USA and its publication, People’s World—successor to the Soviet-funded and directed Daily Worker—were thrilled with what Anthony Kennedy and friends had done.\\nFor communists, this was a stunning victory, the securing of a long-elusive effort to vanquish the fixed marriage model set forth long ago by nature and the Creator. Indeed, if you thought the White House seemed eager to hoist the rainbow colors, you should have seen the American Communist Party.\\nIn fact, the party of the red flag had been waving the rainbow flag before June 26, 2015. Communist Party USA has been pumping the full “LGBT” agenda for several years now.\\nThe day before Kennedy’s landmark opinion came two pieces in People’s World, one titled “Today in Pride Month history: Homosexuals in Holocaust first publicly recognized” and the other titled, “Today in LGBTQ history: Stonewall Inn made historic landmark.” The actual day of the high court’s decision was marked by a lead article titled “Three in a row: SCOTUS upholds marriage equality, Obamacare, Fair Housing Act.” People’s World was grateful for the court’s work across the board.\\nThis intriguing appreciation from American communists is no surprise to those of us who study communism for a living and thus are forced to read websites like People’s World (as well as the homepage of Communist Party USA) as an occupational hazard. We know that one is far more likely to see the rainbow flag at People’s World nowadays than a red flag with a hammer and sickle.\\n>>> For more on this, see Paul Kengor’s new book, “Takedown: From Communists to Progressives, How the Left Has Sabotaged Family and Marriage.”\\nReally, though, the two flags are, in limited but meaningful ways, fighting for certain shared objectives. For today’s communists, the “LGBT” agenda, especially on marriage, is the hammer and sickle to take down the natural, traditional, biblical, Western/Judeo-Christian model for marriage and family that they have long despised. I’ll here very briefly summarize some of the history.\\nA History of Subverting Family and Religion\\nEfforts to fundamentally transform marriage and family have been long at work, but never (until now) accepted and pushed by the mainstream. In the past, these efforts were spearheaded by the most dangerous radicals. For two centuries, leftist extremists made their arguments, from the 1800s to the 1960s, characterized by the Communist Manifesto, where Marx and Engels wrote of the “abolition of the family!” Even then, in 1848, Marx and Engels could call “abolition of the family” an “infamous proposal of the communists.”\\n“Blessed is he who has no family,” Marx wrote to Engels, at best only partly in jest. Marx’s partner in crime detested family and marriage so much that he refused both. The ideological duo fulminated against the “bourgeois claptrap” of marriage, which was merely a “system of housewives held in common.” Engels was carrying the banner to smash monogamy a century before the 1960s New Left adopted the credo.\\nEfforts to revolutionize family and marriage continued, from socialist utopians like Robert Owen, Charles Fourier, and Albert Brisbane to cultural Marxists in the Frankfurt School such as Herbert Marcuse and Wilhelm Reich to 20th-century leftists and progressives ranging from the Bolsheviks—Lenin, Trotsky, Alexandra Kollontai—to Margaret Sanger, Betty Friedan, Kate Millett, and ’60s radicals Bill Ayers, Bernardine Dohrn, and Mark Rudd.\\nWhen Tom Hayden and Robert Scheer ran a “Red Family” colony in near Berkeley in the 1960s, they were merely following the footsteps of socialist-utopian colonies in the 1800s in places like Oneida, New York and New Harmony, Indiana.\\nWere these “ideological colonists” (to borrow an apt description by Pope Francis) supporting same-sex marriage? Of course, not.\\nNo group of radicals, no matter how unhinged, ever contemplated that. The mere fleeting contemplation, the mere momentary notion, the slightest passing fancy of a man legally marrying another man in the 1850s or 1950s would have been scoffed at as incomprehensible. Such proponents would have been deemed certifiably insane.\\nAnd yet, that said, among these far-left elements, the cultural Marxists in particular—the Frankfurt School, Georg Lukacs, Willi Munzenberg, Marcuse, Reich, and allies—and their 1960s New Left inheritors, from Kate Millett to Dohrn, Ayers, Rudd, Hayden, Sheer, and others, sought to fundamentally transform the culture through a new kind of (initially) Freudian-based Marxism that obliterated traditional-religious understandings of sexuality, gender, marriage, and family. For them, their cultural revolution would be achieved through a long march through the institutions, especially academia.\\nIt would take a while, but they were enormously patient, diligent, and ultimately successful. This is where the tectonic shift on marriage and family has taken place. Ask anyone who has lived through it and watched it carefully, and he will tell you that same-sex marriage is a product of our modern universities, which educated today’s culture shapers and fundamental transformers in Hollywood, New York, TV, movies, the media, Google, Facebook, the White House, and on and on.\\nFor the far left, same-sex marriage is the Trojan Horse to secure the takedown of marriage it has long wanted, and countless everyday Americans are oblivious to the older, deeper forces at work. And even more delicious for the left, same-sex marriage is serving as a powerful tool in attacking what the extreme left has always hated most: religion.\\nToday’s advocates of same-sex marriage need to be aware of the quite insidious deeper historical-ideological forces they are unwittingly allied with and aiding and abetting. Sure, that knowledge still will likely not change their minds, and it isn’t going to reverse the Supreme Court decision, but it’s something that a well-informed, thoughtful person should at least be willing to learn about.\\nAlas, does this mean that same-sex marriage is a communist plot? Is that what I’m saying here? Of course not. Please, liberals, don’t be simpletons. Add some nuance to the discussion. Don’t caricature something that should be taken seriously. It would be logically ridiculous and historically simplistic to say that the commies have given us same-sex marriage. But what I am saying is that a people do not wake up one morning, head to Starbucks, and then walk to the office and casually dismiss multi-millennia’s worth of prior wisdom, experience, and opinion—what G. K. Chesterton called “the democracy of the dead”—without some busy work by some factions in the years before.\\nGround had been plowed to ready this soil. The current state is the end-road of a steady evolution that should not be viewed entirely separate from or totally unrelated to early attacks by the far left. That ideological history matters.\\nA Historic Shift\\nA people does not rise up one day in June 2015 and ditch the sacred and natural character of the male-female marital union that served their parents, grandparents, great grandparents, great-great grandparents, great-great-great grandparents, etc. (perhaps I do indeed need to belabor this point, eh?) and the ongoing long line of ancient ancestors who preceded them. All of these relations of ours surely were not mere wild “hate-mongers.”\\nYet, if there is one source of clear commonality, from the early 19th to early 21st centuries, it is this: As modern liberalism/progressivism and the Democratic Party have become increasingly secular, often anti-religious, or certainly dismissive of traditional notions of morality, the embrace of same-sex marriage has become possible.\\nFor communists, two centuries ago and still today, that requisite anti-religious secularism has been there all along. Much of the wider American culture, outside of the far left, has also become secular and dismissive of traditional religious teaching on matters like family and marriage. That disregard if not outright rejection of Christian ethics has brought all of these forces full circle in a joint willingness to permanently alter the historic Western/Christian understanding of male-female matrimony.\\nTake this, for instance, as an illustration: Let’s imagine four people who support redefining marriage via same-sex marriage: The hardcore cultural Marxist professor at “Secular U,” the apolitical soccer mom on Facebook, the gay Episcopal pastor, and the sitcom addict.\\nThey may all come to the “marriage equality” position from entirely different motivations, and otherwise hold little in common ideologically, but they all share one crucial component: Each of them rejects the idea that there is a single, absolute, eternal standard for male-female marriage ordained by nature and nature’s God, and each believes that he can render unto himself\\xa0the right to abolish any such standard and create his own definitions.\\nAs for communists, they couldn’t care less whatever tags or hashtags or slogans or colors the majority culture uses to redefine marriage and family. To them, the larger objective remains the same: to reject and abolish a traditional Judeo-Christian understanding of marriage and family. They are getting what they’ve long wanted, and they could not have done it without the support of mainstream Americans.\\nThe radical left could never have achieved this ultimate takedown of marriage without the larger public’s acquiescence and assistance. The wider same-sex-marriage-supporting public has been the indispensable handmaiden to the radical left’s ability to at long last alter marriage and family. It has been quite a coup.\\nPlease join us at The Heritage Foundation on Oct. 16, 2015,\\xa0from 11am\\xa0to\\xa012pm, for a discussion with author Paul Kengor on his newly released book “Takedown: From Communists to Progressives, How the Left Has Sabotaged Family and Marriage.”',\n",

       " 'George Soros, 86, is a Hungarian-American business magnate, philanthropist, and longtime political financier of progressive causes. (Photo: Caro/Heinrich\\n/Newscom)\\nAs part of his quest to overhaul the American justice system, liberal billionaire George Soros is targeting local prosecutor races like the one in Harris County, a large jurisdiction that includes the city of Houston.\\nMorris Overstreet, a former judge who was the first African-American elected to statewide office in Texas since Reconstruction, was one of the beneficiaries. Overstreet received $100,000 from Soros in the race for Harris County district attorney.\\nBut in a rare lost bet for Soros, Overstreet was defeated easily in the Democratic primary in March by Kim Ogg, a white woman from a prominent political family who has practiced law in Harris County, where she was born, for nearly 30 years.\\nOgg had condemned the Soros donation to Overstreet intended to defeat her, calling it “a last-minute money dump to try to buy the nomination.”\\nToday, Ogg is the Harris County district attorney-elect after going on to beat the Republican incumbent, Devon Anderson. She won the general election with the aid of about $878,000 from the Soros-funded Texas Safety and Justice PAC.\\nSoros pledged allegiance to Ogg after his preferred candidate lost.\\nThe money helped buy television ads accusing Anderson of botching a case in which the district attorney’s office ordered a rape victim jailed to guarantee she would show up in court to testify against her attacker.\\nAssociates of Soros helped craft the message of the ads, Ogg’s campaign confirmed to The Daily Signal. The campaign said Soros’ contributions to Ogg equaled more than half of the $1.5 million she raised in total.\\nThis past week, less than a month before she takes office, Ogg expressed a different view of Soros’ campaign contributions.\\n“Before, I was dismayed he was buying the election,” Ogg said in an interview with The Daily Signal, adding:\\nIt was a last-minute dump [of funds supporting Overstreet]. In my instance, his people came to talk to me after I won the primary, so it was not a last-minute dump. Soros is only half of the story here. My agenda and platform was really set before he spent money in my race, but I am appreciative of the money, as I was with every other dollar.\\n\\nOn Jan. 1, Ogg will begin to try fulfilling the vision she ran on, promising a “significant culture change” defined by taking a more lenient approach to marijuana possession cases, focusing tax dollars on punishing violent criminals, and making it easier for defendants to get out of jail on bond in a county where 70 percent of inmates cannot afford to free themselves before trial.\\nIt’s a set of goals that would seem to match Soros’ preference for how prosecutors do their jobs, using their powerful roles and vast discretion not only to protect public safety but also reduce prison populations and repeat offenses.\\nDespite these overlapping interests, Ogg insists she doesn’t have a mandate from Soros. In fact, she says she’s never spoken to or met with him.\\n“I don’t know George Soros,” Ogg said, then repeated: “I don’t know George Soros.”\\n“I made no promises to Soros or his supporters. The money that helped expose issues here is always a benefit, but I believe voters made their decision not based on the name or identity of a contributor, but on the poor policies and public safety record of my opponent. Plus, I have my own reputation here. In cases of David vs. Goliath, I often represent David. I believe my reputation is intact.”\\n‘Staggering Amount of Money’\\nSoros, 86, an American hedge fund manager and philanthropist, is No. 22 on the Forbes list of the world’s billionaires, with a net worth estimated at $20 billion. He finances a variety of liberal political causes, including ones related to education, immigration, climate change, and the environment.\\nSoros’ philanthropic network, the Open Society Foundations, has spent more than $13 billion over the past three decades on initiatives to defend human rights abroad and shape the democratic process in Eastern Europe.\\nSoros gave an unprecedented $27 million to various 527 groups trying to defeat President George W. Bush in his 2004 re-election campaign, describing the effort as a “matter of life and death.”\\nSoros also helped launch the Democracy Alliance, a group of major liberal donors seeking to advance progressive policymaking by investing in organizations such as Center for American Progress, Media Matters for America, and Organizing for Action, which was set up to advance the agenda of President Barack Obama.\\nSoros has not personally spoken with or met any of the candidates he supported in district attorney races this year and last, his advisers say.\\nIn most of the dozen prosecutor races he helped finance, Soros did not coordinate at all with the candidate he supported, they said. Instead, he operated independently by giving money to various state-level political action committees (PACs) and a national “527” unlimited-money group, each identified by a variation on “Safety and Justice.”\\nThe form of his contributions depended on local and state campaign finance laws, Soros’ advisers say, and in some cases, as in Harris County, the collaboration was more direct.\\n\\nSoros’ efforts are part of a new, broader push by progressives to locate, prepare, and fund challengers to unseat incumbent prosecutors. Such upsets are notoriously difficult to achieve in local district attorney races, where name recognition and outside interest are usually low and voters give deference to the candidate with a record.\\n“Criminal justice reform efforts must take many forms,” Whitney Tymas, an adviser on Soros’ project challenging sitting prosecutors, said in a statement to The Daily Signal. Tymas added:\\nChanging laws and redirecting funding streams is critical. Because of the enormous discretion vested in those who enforce the laws, including prosecutors, it is also important to elect officials who are committed to public safety and equal justice. These officials are a key leverage point in a complicated system.\\nDavid Alan Sklansky, a Stanford University professor and former federal prosecutor, told The Daily Signal that only a “handful” of races for the 2,500 district attorneys’ offices nationwide included candidates with “reform-oriented” agendas, and of those that did, most did not involve contributions from Soros.\\n“In a number of high-visibility district attorney races around the country, incumbents this year were unseated by challengers who promised a more moderate approach to criminal justice, backing away from a simple ‘tough on crime’ agenda and paying more attention to fairness, proportionality, and equity,” Sklansky said. “Many of these successful candidates also pledged to improve the investigation of police shootings, to rein in prosecutorial misconduct, and to be more vigilant in avoiding and correcting wrongful convictions.”\\nStill, Soros’ role in local prosecutor races is significant. It touches counties big and small, urban and rural; northern, southern, western, eastern, and midwestern. In total, Soros spent nearly $11 million on 12 district attorney races this election cycle, campaign filings show.\\nA Democrat candidate supported by Soros ultimately won in 10 of the 12 races.\\n\\nThe trend of outside funding worries opponents of Soros’ tactics, including veteran district attorneys who say the outsize contributions threaten prosecutorial independence, which is especially important in a role as powerful and all-encompassing as theirs.\\n“The amount of money we are talking about is staggering,” said Joshua Marquis, the district attorney of Clatsop County, Oregon, since 1994 and a board member of the National District Attorneys Association.\\n“And it’s amplified because it’s extremely difficult to raise money as a prosecutor,” Marquis told The Daily Signal, adding:\\nTo ask for money when you are a prosecutor, there is something inherently icky about all of it. The argument on one side is this is good, and it’s just turning on a searchlight and looking at these issues. But that’s naive in the extreme because it’s the money that is funding debates and actual discussions. If you are able to pay for and tell your side of the story over and over again on television ads, you are going to win.\\n‘Couldn’t Compete’\\nMatthew McCord faced an uphill challenge to counter his Soros-backed opponent.\\nMcCord, a Republican who ran for district attorney in Henry County, Georgia, was not an incumbent and did not have a prosecutor’s record to run on.\\nHe had $60,000 in his campaign fund and a supportive family, but in September he decided that wasn’t enough. McCord dropped out of the race after learning Soros had contributed $100,000 to a political action committee supporting his opponent, Democrat Darius Pattillo.\\n“The joke was people were saying to me, ‘You need to fight to the death,’ and I said, ‘To whose death, mine?’” McCord told The Daily Signal in an interview. “Soros apparently had a single-minded mission to make sure I was not successful. I couldn’t compete.”\\n\\nMcCord, a municipal judge and local lawyer, said he ran on a platform similar to Pattillo, a deputy chief assistant district attorney in nearby DeKalb County. McCord said both candidates called for relieving overburdened courts and crowded jails by providing more alternatives to prosecution for low-risk offenders as well as better community outreach.\\nPattillo did not respond to a request for an interview from The Daily Signal.\\n“I am viewed as a fairly centrist conservative,” McCord said. “I don’t know there was much difference between my approach to justice and his [Pattillo]. When did progressives and liberals get a monopoly on the idea of criminal justice reform? Soros doesn’t even know me. He didn’t ask me what my views were or what I would do.”\\nSoros so far has backed only Democrats in district attorney races, but his advisers insist his support for candidates isn’t based on political party and say Soros would consider making a large contribution to a “reform-minded” Republican prosecutor.\\nMcCord said he doesn’t know if he will run again for district attorney—his dream job. But he said he knows what would stop him from trying.\\n“I’d rather be a private citizen doing the right thing than be a bought man,” McCord said.\\n‘A Little Bit of Love’\\nProsecutors drive critical decisions in the criminal justice system, choosing when, whether, and against whom to bring criminal charges, as well as making recommendations for sentencing and setting the terms of plea negotiations.\\nThese decisions are receiving more scrutiny at a time where there is a growing bipartisan consensus around the need to reduce incarceration, provide more alternative punishments, and expand rehabilitation opportunities for low-level drug offenders.\\nAs part of this effort, Soros, along with progressive groups advocating racial justice and gender equality, is trying to elect more minority prosecutors in response to what he sees as an insufficient response by incumbent district attorneys to the fatal shootings of black men by police officers.\\nSeveral candidates who Soros backed are members of minority groups.\\nThe Reflective Democracy Campaign, an arm of the progressive Women Donors Network, found in a 2015 study that 95 percent of elected local prosecutors were white.\\n\\n“Of course, what was happening with Black Lives Matter and police shootings was a huge wake-up call [for progressives, who began] realizing how much power these offices have and the need for us to be focused on getting great people elected,” Andrea Dew Steele, president of Emerge America, a candidate-training organization for Democratic women, said in an interview with The Daily Signal.\\n“District attorney races have historically just been completely ignored, like most down-ballot races, in the progressive and Democratic community,” Steele said. “I am just thrilled to see that if you give a little bit of love to these races, a small investment yields a huge outcome.”\\nIn Chicago’s Cook County, Soros funded one of several groups that helped Kim Foxx, who is black, defeat the incumbent state’s attorney, Anita Alvarez, in the Democratic primary. Foxx then easily beat her Republican general election opponent.\\nAlvarez drew widespread criticism for her handling of the 2014 fatal police shooting of Laquan McDonald, a black 17-year-old. She took 13 months before charging the Chicago police officer who shot and killed McDonald, a delay that sparked protests.\\n“Soros’ funding was a big factor in my loss, obviously,” Alvarez, the first female and first Hispanic candidate to be elected as Cook County’s top prosecutor, said in an interview with The Daily Signal. “Some people want to say I lost my election simply because of the McDonald video, but I felt this movement prior to my charging that officer. When you have these outside influences, it’s scary because they don’t know the climate—that Chicago has a serious violent crime problem, a serious gun problem.”\\nIn Chicago’s Cook County, incumbent State’s Attorney Anita Alvarez was defeated by a candidate who received support from George Soros. (Photo: Abel Uribe/MCT/Newscom\\nUnder Alvarez’s leadership, Cook County created a nationally recognized pretrial diversion program. Diversion is intended to promise low-risk defendants a second chance. Eligible individuals are not prosecuted, but instead receive supervision services such as counseling and job training, and can have their criminal record expunged.\\nSuch diversion programs exist in almost every state, but Cook County’s is considered especially innovative because defendants pay no fee to participate, meaning poorer individuals can benefit from the services.\\n“It would have been a wonderful thing if George Soros actually would have looked at my record,” Alvarez said. “He probably would have liked what he saw.”\\nSoros’ money also helped Aramis Ayala upset incumbent Jeff Ashton in the Democratic primary for Florida state attorney for Orange and Osceola counties.\\nThe Soros funding paid for TV ads and mailers accusing Ashton of carrying out racially disparate policies—a claim he denied.\\nAyala, a black woman, became the first African-American elected as a state attorney in Florida.\\n“Race does not explicitly play a role, but in seeking candidates who understand the injustices of the current system, many of them turn out to be African-American or Latino, because it is people of color who have been disproportionately affected by those injustices,” Tymas, the Soros adviser, told The Daily SIgnal.\\n‘Couldn’t Stop Them’\\nLast year, Scott Colom took a risky approach to his run for district attorney in a four-county stretch in Mississippi.\\nColom, who is black and a Democrat, promised voters he would promote more rehabilitation and less incarceration for drug offenders, especially young people—although he also said he’d be tough on violent criminals.\\nVoters validated Colom’s agenda. It also was backed by Soros, who gave almost $400,000 to a Mississippi PAC supporting Colom’s campaign to defeat a long-entrenched incumbent, Forrest Allgood, an aggressive prosecutor whose record had been heavily criticized.\\nThat PAC also backed the re-election campaign of another local prosecutor, Hinds County District Attorney Robert Shuler Smith.\\nColom now has served a year as district attorney of Mississippi’s 16th District. He has implemented some of his proposed policies, including expanding eligibility for pretrial diversion to defendants arrested for offenses such as selling marijuana.\\nIn an interview with The Daily Signal, Colom said personal experience shapes his worldview. He grew up in Columbus, Mississippi, and watched high school classmates go to prison.\\nWhile in law school, Colom interned with the chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in Arusha, Tanzania, witnessing poverty and gaining an understanding of how government policy can hold people back.\\n“I had the courage to run on this criminal justice reform message based on my own personal convictions, before I had any idea there would be any national money, or a George Soros, supporting me,” Colom said. “I decided to run this way having no idea on how it polled. This is how I believed I should be elected.”\\n\\nColom, like Ogg in Harris County, said he didn’t know how Soros learned about who he is and what his positions are.\\nColom said he never has been in contact with Soros, or anyone associated with him—and does not plan to connect with him now. He said he learned about Soros’ contribution only after seeing and hearing television and radio ads supporting his election.\\nColom said the nearly $400,000 in outside money likely helped him, but that he also raised $150,000 on his own and knocked on doors every day from 3 to 7 p.m. during campaign season.\\n“This was a trying experience,” Colom said. “The most difficult thing I have done was to run for this office. It is important people get the whole picture of how I ran, not just one aspect of it.”\\nColom added:\\nI don’t know George Soros. Do I think his spending money to spread my message helped me? I think any time your message spreads to more people, that helps that candidate get their message out. But what I emphasize is, the message has to be something someone agrees with. The people agree with my message. The people understand if you can avoid sending someone to prison and avoid the scar of a felony record, you should do that.\\nColom’s candidacy for attorney general in Mississippi’s 16th District was one of the first such races that Soros has supported. As the Soros effort spreads, Colom says, it’s a difficult thing for candidates to counter.\\n“His support is not even something I can accept or decline,” Colom said. “They spend money independent of me. I couldn’t stop them. Honestly, I wouldn’t know who to ask if I wanted them to stop.”\\nOvercoming ‘Radical Agenda’\\nPete Weir was able to halt Soros’ momentum by winning.\\nSoros dedicated $1.2 million to defeat Weir, the incumbent Republican district attorney of Gilpin and Jefferson counties in suburban Colorado.\\nSoros contributed to a PAC running negative ads against Weir in support of Democrat challenger Jake Lilly, a former prosecutor and Iraq War veteran. One mailer said the incumbent “can’t be trusted to keep us safe from sex offenders.”\\nIn an interview with The Daily Signal, Weir said he overcame Soros’ influence by emphasizing his 37 years of criminal justice experience. The record, he said, includes a longtime dedication to reform—the cause that Soros says he is promoting.\\n“There was a backlash and outrage over the negative ads directed to me and an outrage over the prospect of an East Coast billionaire trying to buy our justice system,” Weir said, adding of Soros:\\nHe knows nothing about our community, and what the criminal justice issues are in our counties. But it didn’t change my tactics or the way we campaigned on a positive message, on my experience. What he could not overcome were the relationships we had built in the community.\\n\\nWeir said he spent about $80,000 on his re-election campaign, using that money to spread the message that his office is “progressive,” combining “aggressive prosecution when it’s called for with innovative, problem-solving courts.”\\nWeir is a member of the Colorado Commission on Criminal and Juvenile Justice, which has helped pass state legislation reducing prison sentences for drug crimes.\\nHe says he will continue to support reforms as prosecutor, because it’s what residents of Gilpin and Jefferson counties want. Even if he shares some of Soros’ goals, he said, those efforts should be dictated by local officials.\\n“It sounds immodest to say, but you would be hard-pressed to find another prosecutor in Colorado who has led reform efforts realizing we can do a better job in more areas,” Weir told The Daily Signal. “As a prosecutor community, we realize the system is imperfect and changes can and should be made. But to see some East Coast billionaire who has no idea of local interests acceding to a radical reform agenda at the expense of our democratic process is incredibly dangerous.”\\n‘Be More Political’\\nSoros and allied progressive groups say they will continue grooming and supporting prosecutor candidates who share their goals.\\nSteele, of Emerge America, says she already is looking ahead to the 2018 elections, with plans to recruit and train at least 25 Democratic women to run in district attorney races.\\nWomen, she says, are uniquely sensitive to the consequences of incarceration and, as prosecutors, are likely to use their powers more carefully.\\n“I am hopeful that Emerge will have women running for district attorney in 2018 and make it onto Soros’ radar screen,” Steele said. “The George Soroses of the world can’t get the outcomes they desire unless you have great candidates. So what we are doing is a critical piece.”\\nShe does not apologize for the aggressive outreach, arguing that because a state’s top prosecutors are elected, the process to become one is inherently political.\\n“All of these races are political,” Steele said, adding:\\nYou have to run a race in order to win. I would say these races need to be even more political. Because the progressive community wants to see certain outcomes, less mass incarceration, that’s the outcome. In order to see that, we need to win races, and get qualified, good people running for these offices that had previously been uncontested.\\nMarquis, of the National District Attorneys Association, says he doesn’t doubt the sincerity of Soros and of progressive groups. He emphasizes that many members of the association, which represents state-level district attorneys across the U.S., support reform.\\nIndeed, the National District Attorneys Association made headlines earlier this year when it endorsed compromise legislation in Congress meant to reduce mandatory minimum sentences for low-level drug offenders in the federal prison system.\\nYet Marquis said he worries that despite these efforts, some incumbent members of the association could lose their jobs to better-funded challengers.\\n“This is the source of great conversation among district attorneys,” Marquis said. “A lot of us are sitting around saying, ‘What if it’s me next? What if I am targeted?’”',\n",
       " 'George Soros’ political action committee poured $2.1 million into ordinarily sleepy local races. Pictured: Soros delivers a speech on the sideline of the World Economic Forum annual meeting Jan. 24, 2019, in Davos, Switzerland. (Photo: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images)\\nRadical social justice activists will serve as the top prosecutors for three major Washington, D.C., suburbs—including the two wealthiest counties in the U.S.—after George Soros’ political action committee poured $2.1 million into ordinarily sleepy local races.\\nIn\\xa0Virginia’s\\xa0Fairfax and Arlington counties, the “reformer” attorneys ran on platforms far to the left of the Democratic incumbents, beating them in primary races before ultimately winning the general elections.\\nIn both cases, the incumbents expressed concern for public safety if the\\xa0Soros-backed candidates took control. They also said that the activists were pushing a national platform about racism and over-incarceration that had no basis in reality in the affluent, liberal jurisdictions.\\nAfter losing the Democratic primary to\\xa0Soros-backed Steve Descano, Fairfax’s longtime prosecutor, Ray Morrogh, warned his fellow party members that safety could be at risk if they elected Descano in the general election. He quit the party to endorse Jonathan Fahey, an experienced prosecutor who was running as an independent, to try to avert a Descano victory.\\nDescano\\xa0“is completely unqualified for the office of commonwealth attorney,” Morrogh said in a video. “The only case he tried, he disgraced himself when the judge reversed the conviction because [he] lied in closing argument. This man is not fit to hold office in Fairfax County.”\\n“I’ve dedicated 36 years of my life to keeping you safe in Fairfax County, and I’ve never asked for anything,” Morrogh continued. “But I love my country, I love this county, and I believe in public safety. I’m asking you, vote for Jonathan Fahey for all the victims in this county.”\\nDescano narrowly beat Morrogh in the primary after receiving\\xa0$400,000\\xa0from Soros’ PAC, financial disclosures show. Morrogh raised $250,000, with no one donor giving more than $10,000.\\nFahey told The Daily Caller News Foundation, “The weird thing is, as a result of Soros pouring money into low-turnout primaries, center-left voters are unquestionably more closely aligned to the Republican candidates than they are to these radical challengers. If the citizens were informed they’d never vote for this.”\\nWith little media coverage of suburban politics, locals seemed unaware of the schism between traditional Democrats and the far-left candidates backed by the New York billionaire’s political fund, Fahey said. Even though Descano only narrowly won the primary with\\xa051%\\xa0to Morrogh’s 49%, Fahey—the candidate endorsed by Morrogh—received only 38% of the vote in the general election.\\nDescano received another $200,000 from Soros’ PAC during the general election, while Fahey raised $240,000 with no single massive donor, according to the most recent financial disclosures.\\n“People just went in and voted party ballots. They tell themselves they’re somehow sticking it to [President Donald] Trump by voting for someone unqualified to be the local prosecutor,” Fahey told The Daily Caller News Foundation. “They want to make a stand, but it’s like, you have a chance to do that and it’s in 2020. It’s self-destructive how Trump kind of owns the Democrats mentally.”\\n“We have a world right now where the president picks the U.S. attorneys and George Soros picks the top state prosecutors. And that’s a scary world to live in,” he said.\\n“The Dem politicians don’t actually want it to happen, but they’re afraid to stand up to it because they don’t want to be the next one to be primaried,” Fahey continued. “And the Republicans, I don’t know why they aren’t willing to put resources into pushing back on this.”\\nThe Soros candidates ran on a platform of not prosecuting certain crimes and charging others as misdemeanors when state law says they’re felonies. “Virginia’s felony larceny threshold of $500—the value of stolen goods that gives rise to felony charges instead of misdemeanor charges—is much too low,” Descano wrote in campaign materials.\\nBut prosecutors like Morrogh insisted that regardless of how they feel personally, it is up to the state legislature to pass or repeal laws.\\n“We are a nation of laws, not men,” Morrogh\\xa0said, Sun Gazette Newspapers reported. “I’m not a super-legislator.”\\nFahey told The Daily Caller News Foundation, “You take an oath to enforce the law and do so fairly and impartially, not just the laws you like or the ones that are popular within your party … If a Republican candidate won and said, ‘I’m pro-gun so I’m not going to enforce any gun laws,’ people would be up in arms.”\\nDescano has said he won’t charge theft under $1,500 as a felony.\\n“Property crimes will go up, more victims. Police are so demoralized by this that good police are going to leave, so quality of policing will go down within a year,” Fahey said. “Criminals know where they can commit crimes and not get in trouble, and they will come here.”\\n“In California they did the same thing and theft is up dramatically,” he\\xa0continued. “California is our future other than we don’t get the weather. If you look at objective data, it doesn’t work. But Soros has nothing at stake, if it goes poorly here he’s not harmed.”\\nPolice Benevolent Association of\\xa0Fairfax County\\xa0President Andrew Wright said in a statement that “The stated goals of Mr. Descano to decrease or eliminate the prosecution of minor theft and drug cases will change our county for years to come.”\\nAn Inner-City Movement Implanted in the Suburbs by a Billionaire\\nDescano, a tax attorney, raised $800,000—$600,000\\xa0of which came from Soros’ PAC, and $75,000 of which came from his own parents.\\nSoros’ out-of-state group, the Justice & Safety PAC, pushed candidates running on a platform about “criminal justice reform” that originated out of the identity politics movements in inner cities. But this year’s batch ran in quiet, affluent suburbs where those issues plainly didn’t apply, Fahey and Arlington’s Democratic prosecutor said.\\n“If you take away Soros, there is no organic ‘criminal justice reform’ movement in these counties,” Fahey told the DCNF. “No one is really wanting it, and they’re going to do it anyway.”\\nDescano’s\\xa0plan\\xa0for “progressive justice” includes “ending mass incarceration” and eliminating cash bail.\\n“I will tackle mass incarceration by ending the practices of charging felonies where misdemeanors are sufficient and charging misdemeanors where a dismissal or diversion would be more appropriate,” he wrote, adding that he believes prosecutors over-charge crimes. “The numbers don’t lie. Far too often race and ethnicity are determining factors in the outcome of one’s experience with the criminal justice system.”\\nChap Petersen, a Democratic Virginia state senator who represents Fairfax, said in a Washington Post op-ed that Descano ran primarily on a\\xa0false narrative\\xa0that had no applicability to the county.\\n“A few months ago, Fairfax County was the envy of American municipalities for its system of law enforcement,” he wrote in June. “Its crime rate was the lowest of any jurisdiction with more than 1 million residents in the United States. Its jail population was at its lowest point in 40 years. The county had successfully implemented jail diversion programs for veterans and drug courts to treat the addicted.”\\n“Morrogh was outspent 2 to 1; his message of quiet competence was drowned by out by a mail and canvassing campaign that used words such as ‘racial profiling’ and ‘mass incarceration’ in describing Fairfax County’s criminal-justice system,” Petersen wrote. “The fact that these buzzwords were largely irrelevant in the low-crime, progressive county didn’t matter. It was a winning message in a primary focused on hardcore partisan voters.

Newman, who is an African American pioneer in this community, there has been this malignant and oppressive force at work … is preposterous.”\\n“I’m not going to apologize for being a prosecutor,” she continued. “I think it’s very misguided to back away from the actual work of prosecution because that’s what does keep communities safe, it’s what gives voice to victims of crime.”\\nStamos raised\\xa0$175,000, while Dehghani-Tafti raised $850,000,\\xa0$630,000 of which\\xa0came from the Soros PAC and $80,000 of which came from New Virginia Majority PAC, which is focused on building “power in working-class communities of color.” Arlington is decidedly not working-class, and its\\xa0largest donors\\xa0are Soros’ PAC and national unions.\\nThere was no independent or Republican on the ballot to challenge Dehghani-Tafti after her unexpected defeat of Stamos.\\n‘Independent Expenditures’\\nSoros’ Justice and Public Safety PAC poured millions of dollars into the three races combined.\\nThe organization is a “super PAC” that runs “independent expenditures” that support the candidates, meaning Soros’ staff was essentially controlling the bulk of the efforts—creating mailers and running polls and digital ads—and simply using the candidates’ names.\\nIn Loudoun County, Virginia, the wealthiest county in America, Buta Biberaj narrowly defeated Republican incumbent prosecutor Nicole Wittmann after the Soros PAC spent\\xa0$845,000\\xa0on her.

       " 'I wanted to see for myself what conditions are really like in San Francisco, the nation\\'s most liberal city.  (Photo: Katrina Trinko/The Daily Signal)\\nSAN FRANCISCO—Call me a poop skeptic.\\nAfter years of reading about the alleged horrors of San Francisco, I decided I wanted to see for myself if the City by the Bay was really in such dire conditions.\\nI’d grown up 30 miles south of San Francisco, occasionally popping in for field trips or shopping or sightseeing. Sure, the city had always had homeless people, but the conditions I read about—needles everywhere, “poop maps” documenting the location of human feces—seemed absurd.\\xa0\\nHow bad could it actually be in one of America’s most famous cities?\\nCould one of the most famously liberal cities in the nation have disintegrated into disaster? \\nIn 2009, I’d moved away from California. In the decade and change since, San Francisco has undergone a radical transformation. A new wave of top Silicon Valley companies—Twitter, Uber, Facebook—opened headquarters or offices in the city. And while San Francisco hadn’t ever been inexpensive, housing costs soared, with the median housing price more than doubling since 2010.\\nThe 49ers, a football team, retained “San Francisco” in their name, but left famed Candlestick Park, now demolished, for Santa Clara, a California town south and in the middle of Silicon Valley—although San Francisco did gain the Golden State Warriors, a basketball team.\\xa0\\nUber and Lyft, which first came to San Francisco in 2010, now dominate ride-sharing services, their drivers swooping up and down the city’s famous hills.\\nYet one change hadn’t occurred: The city has proudly remained a liberal bastion.\\nHome to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s congressional district, San Francisco is reliably and overwhelmingly blue in every election (with perhaps a few votes going to the Green Party). \\nIn just the past year, the city’s Board of Supervisors declared the National Rifle Association to be a “domestic terrorist organization,” and the school board voted first to paint over, and then to hide, a mural of George Washington in one of the city’s high schools—a mural, incidentally, painted by a leftist who strove to show both Washington’s greatness and flaws.\\nSuch actions are just par for the course for San Francisco, a city of more than 884,000 that in the past decade also banned fast-food restaurants from including toys with most children’s meals; prohibited city-funded travel by local employees to 22 pro-life states; raised the minimum wage from $9.79 to $15.59 an hour;\\xa0and, after banning plastic bags in 2007, first set a 10-cent fee for each nonreusable bag at stores, and then a 25-cent fee per bag.\\nYes, leftist insanity has long been the norm for San Francisco. But the liberal would-be-utopia had once been seen as a great city, not a filthy environment full of struggling people.\\xa0\\nIn a tweet in December, President Donald Trump wrote: “Nancy Pelosi’s district in California has rapidly become one of the worst anywhere in the U.S. when it come[s] to the homeless and crime. It has gotten so bad, so fast.”\\nNancy Pelosi’s District in California has rapidly become one of the worst anywhere in the U.S. when it come to the homeless & crime. It has gotten so bad, so fast – she has lost total control and, along with her equally incompetent governor, Gavin Newsom, it is a very sad sight!\\nShowing it wasn’t just some “right-wing conspiracy” that San Francisco was falling apart, Oracle, one of the huge tech companies in the region, announced in December that its annual OpenWorld conference was going to Las Vegas for the next three years—costing San Francisco an estimated $64 million in potential revenue. An email from the San Francisco Travel Association, obtained by CNBC, mentioned “poor street conditions” as a factor.\\nSo two days before Christmas, I left my parents’ house and made my way over to San Francisco.\\nI wanted to see for myself what conditions were really like. Was the middle class being driven away? Was the city as liberal as its politicians suggested? How many people were living on the streets?\\nTwenty-two thousand steps and four Uber and Lyft drives later, here’s what I saw.\\nBefore arriving in the city, I’d read that the Tenderloin neighborhood—just blocks from a major mall and retail area—is one of the worst.\\nSure enough, as soon as I drift away from the retail and go a couple blocks into the Tenderloin, things get, well, smelly.\\nTo my surprise, there are tents everywhere in the neighborhood. Years ago, during the Occupy Wall Street movement, I’d visited an Occupy encampment in Boston.\\nThis seemed similar, although there is one key difference. In Boston, the tents were set up in a park. In San Francisco, the tents are openly obstructing the sidewalk—and not just on one block.\\nIn the course of my day, I see several blocks like this clustered in the Tenderloin neighborhood and vicinity.\\xa0\\nSome are just a block or two away from a police station. San Francisco’s new district attorney, Chesa Boudin, told the ACLU in a candidate questionnaire: “Crimes such as public camping, offering or soliciting sex, public urination, blocking a sidewalk, etc. should not and will not be prosecuted.”\\nI also notice something that I hadn’t seen much during my years in New York City and Washington, D.C.: homeless women, although far fewer than homeless men.\\nNationally, homelessness increased by 2.7% in 2019, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. “Homelessness in California is at a crisis level,” HUD Secretary Ben Carson said in a formal statement.\\xa0\\nResidents of San Francisco likely agree: Three-quarters of respondents to a survey said homelessness in the city was getting worse, and a little over half mentioned it as a top issue, according to a 2019 report from the San Francisco Office of the Controller.\\nIn 2019, San Francisco decided to try keeping three public restrooms open 24 hours a day in the worst areas. It’s not cheap—to keep them clean, one attendant is present during daytime hours and, presumably for safety, two are present at night.\\n“History has shown that without attendants, public toilets in some of San Francisco’s most challenging neighborhoods are used for drug activity and prostitution, and become targets of vandalism,” writes the San Francisco Chronicle’s Phil Matier.\\xa0\\nMatier also did the math: After looking at the cost of funding the toilets and the amount of times the toilets were used at night, he calculated each restroom use cost the city $28.52.\\xa0\\nIn addition to three 24/7 toilets, another 21 public toilets are available at certain hours, funded by the city. “The popular program … provides an alternative to using our streets and sidewalks as a toilet,” states the San Francisco Public Works website.\\nThe toilets advertise that people can dispose of needles there, another sign of San Francisco’s relaxed approach to drugs. Thomas Wolf, a former drug addict who lived on the streets of San Francisco for a few months in 2018, is among those now advocating the city change its approach toward drugs.\\nWolf “thinks the city is too wedded to harm reduction—making it safer to use drugs—rather than encouraging people to stop using,” the Chronicle reported in December. “He said he was offered free, clean drug paraphernalia by outreach workers, but doesn’t remember ever being offered a treatment bed or even being asked whether he wanted help quitting. Not once.”\\nWolf, who has ceased using drugs and now serves on San Francisco’s Street-Level Drug Dealing Task Force and works for the Salvation Army’s Railton Place as a case manager and life skills coach, estimated that 90% of the homeless he lived with in Tenderloin and the adjacent South of Market neighborhood were addicted to drugs or alcohol.\\n“With harm reduction, the whole point is to use less while respecting your civil liberties,” Wolf told the Chronicle. “When I was out there homeless and leaving my needles in the street and defecating in the street and urinating in the street, was I protecting your civil liberties?”\\nWalking around the Tenderloin neighborhood in the morning, I encounter workers washing a sidewalk—and asking homeless people to move.\\nA worker sprays water right up to the brink of a homeless man’s stuff on the sidewalk. The homeless man, who is shoving his belongings into a bag or backpack, starts shouting at the worker, saying (and I’m editing this since we’re a family news outlet), “The f—, man?”\\xa0\\nHe keeps shouting, bellowing sentiments along the lines of “Who the f— do you think you are, f—ing my stuff, man?” as he continues to pack up.\\nIn early December, the Tenderloin Community Benefit District and San Francisco Supervisor Matt Haney announced the beginning of weekly power-washings in the district, instead of monthly.\\xa0\\nDavid Elliott Lewis, a local who is a community organizer, said, per the press release: “Even though seeing human and animal feces on our sidewalks is a common occurrence, I find it upsetting and disturbing every single time.”\\nAccording to RentHop.com, “Tenderloin has been on a winning streak for the ‘poopiest neighborhood’ contest for the past three years. The neighborhood saw 8,644.2 animal/human waste incidents per square mile in 2017, 7,722.8 in 2018, and 6,887.9 so far in 2019.”\\nWashing sidewalks is hardly the only way the city is addressing the crisis. In the past decade, San Francisco has been on a spending spree to help the homeless.\\xa0\\n“Between 2011 and 2012, SF spent $157 million on homeless services. By the 2015-2016 fiscal year, it was up to $242 million. In the most recent 2019-2020 budget proposals, the figure hit more than $364 million. But the consensus remains that more is needed,” reports Curbed San Francisco, which estimates the homeless population now could be as high as 17,600.\\xa0\\nWhat’s going on with the tourist areas, attractions that long have drawn people from around the country and the world to San Francisco’s shores?\\n“The loveliness of Paris seems somehow sadly gay/The glory that was Rome is of another day/I’ve been terribly alone and forgotten in Manhattan/I’m going home to my City by the Bay,” Tony Bennett famously warbled in “I Left My Heart in San Francisco.”\\nBut local business owners are concerned tourists aren’t so tempted these days to explore what was once dubbed the “Paris of the West.”\\nFor years, Pier 39—a mix of kitschy shops, restaurants, a carousel, and the odd street entertainer—has been a top tourist destination. Now, businesses fret, times are a-changing.\\n“We saw a pretty sharp decline since [2016-2017],” Brian Hayes, who owns seven shops and kiosks on the pier, told ABC7 (KGO-TV). “A lot of it is attributed to the homeless.”\\n“I know myself I’ll go on vacation, I’ll spend more money, but I have to have a good experience and I don’t want to have to look at the homeless and I don’t want to have to see needles on the ground and human feces. It’s not where you want to go on vacation,” Sandra Fletcher, president of Simco Restaurants, which owns five restaurants on the pier and also is facing more trouble drumming up business, told ABC7.\\nThe day I am there, Pier 39 appears to have its usual hustle and bustle. A pack of people gather around an entertainer boasting that he can pull out the balloon he’s swallowed. A kid shrieks on a bungee flying ride.\\xa0\\nIn a store that sells products only for left-handed people, customers browse. The women’s restroom is decently clean, given that it’s a free public one in a high-traffic area.\\nA little outside Pier 39, I see a man in a wheelchair gliding along, plaintively asking people if they could help him out. He wears a 49ers cap and a red scarf and a checked sports coat, which I hope keeps him warm in this neighborhood right on the water.\\nIn the few blocks between the Pier and Fisherman’s Wharf—another frequent tourist stop, essentially a line of bayside restaurants and food counters selling seafood—I notice one man sleeping on the ground.\\nIn the area around Fisherman’s Wharf, souvenir shops sell swag and gifts that capitalize on the city’s liberal reputation:\\nI also browse Union Square, rimmed by some of the top shopping destinations of San Francisco: a gigantic, eight-story Macy’s, a Saks Fifth Avenue boasting of carrying “faux fur” in one of its windows, a Tiffany’s with sparkling jewelry in its whimsical Christmas displays, and a sleek Apple Store. A Christmas tree is lit in the square, and an ice skating rink is open for Californians wistfully wanting to capture some taste of a white Christmas.\\nAbout a week before my visit, Union Square was where San Francisco strained to restore its reputation. On the heels of the news of the Oracle convention’s move to Vegas, Mayor London Breed declared that San Francisco is a “world class city” and pledged further steps to address homelessness.\\nYet as the Chronicle’s Matier noted, Breed’s comments in Union Square came at the same time that “an image of a man with his pants around his knees defecating in a [San Francisco] Safeway aisle was rocketing around the internet and TV.”\\nFor San Francisco, the Oracle convention wasn’t even the first blow. In 2018, tourism and convention bureau SF Travel announced that a medical association, never named, was looking for another location for its conferences after 2023, despite holding the gatherings in the city since the 1980s.\\xa0\\n“Postconvention surveys showed their members were afraid to walk amid the open drug use, threatening behavior and mental illness that are common on the streets,” reports the San Francisco Chronicle.\\nI see a couple of homeless people around Union Square, but nothing unusual for an urban area.\\xa0The Union Square neighborhood effectively borders the Tenderloin, however, meaning a confused tourist could easily end up there.\\nAt lunchtime, I pop into a church—one with the glorious architecture, high ceilings, and impressive art characteristic of so many older Catholic churches in the United States.\\nAs the church’s bells chime, the sound of a vigorous snorer fills the lulls in between.\\nSt. Boniface Church, in the Tenderloin neighborhood, allows the homeless to sleep in the pews every weekday through a nonprofit program called the Gubbio Project.\\xa0\\nAround since the 1860s, the parish originally was the religious home of Germans in the city. The current church was built in 1902, and although it escaped the 1906 earthquake, it was ravaged by the subsequent fires. Rebuilding was completed in 1908.\\n“The Gubbio Project uses the back two-thirds of the sanctuary; the church uses the front one-third to celebrate the daily Mass,” the program states on its website. “This sends a powerful message to our unhoused neighbors—they are in essence part of the community, not to be kicked out when those with homes come in to worship. It also sends a message to those attending Mass—the community includes the tired, the poor, those with mental health issues and those who are wet, cold and dirty.”\\nThe day I arrive at St. Boniface’s, the front of the church glitters with Christmas decorations.\\nDuring the Communion service—there isn’t a Mass that day—the church is mostly quiet. During one brief moment, someone starts babbling, only to be told to be quiet by others.\\xa0 When I look back, I don’t see any of the homeless people actively participating in the religious rites.\\xa0\\nAfter the service, I explore the rest of the church. Most of the wooden pews—with no padding for comfort—are occupied by a sleeping person. Three people are lying on the floor in the back.\\nI speak briefly to Michael Bonner, a new employee of the Gubbio Project. When I ask Bonner how the homeless can be helped and what should be done, he speaks of a lack of motivation, of people “going down a path of not caring anymore” instead of having “a fire burning in you.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nBonner talks about the need for a work ethic, and how it’s too simplistic to say the homeless problem is an effect of the city’s expensive housing. But he’s also adamant that people need help: “We just can’t give up on the willing,” he says.\\nI ask him if the homeless people he encounters have loved ones or families who could help. Bonner says most of them are “probably embarrassed to go home” because “you don’t want to hear it from your family anymore” after presumably failing in previous tries to get off the streets.\\nOne of the big tensions in San Francisco—and in the wider Bay Area region—in recent years has been the perceived gulf between the affluent and everybody else. As my colleague Jarrett Stepman has chronicled, California increasingly is becoming a place for the poor and the rich, not the middle class.\\nSo out of curiosity, I walk over to Twitter’s headquarters, just a few blocks away from St. Boniface’s, passing City Hall.\\xa0 Twitter is just one of several companies—others include Salesforce, Facebook, Square, and Uber—that have come to San Francisco in recent years.\\xa0\\nNo doubt the city has seen a business boom: “Citywide, the unemployment rate fell from 9% in 2011 to 2.6% this year, and the number of jobs grew from 543,600 in 2011 to an estimated 730,900 last year, according to state data,” reports the Chronicle.\\nThe area around Twitter is quiet the day I am there, and there is no sign of anyone living—or begging—on the streets. Beneath Twitter’s headquarters is a bougie food hall and a grocery store that, incredibly, makes Whole Foods seem like an affordable option.\\nIn the food hall, I stop for lunch at The Organic Coup—which was basically everything you’d expect from a shop in a\\xa0 Francisco food hall. It brands itself as the first “organic fast food restaurant” and urges me to “taste the revolution.”\\xa0\\nApparently, fast-food prices don’t apply in the revolutionary era: My lunch of chicken strips and tater tots, and nary a drink, costs $12.81.\\nHowever, the food hall offers plenty of options beyond organic tater tots, including—I kid you not—caviar.\\nOne of my Lyft drivers, whose name I’m not using because I didn’t get his permission to quote him on the record, calls San Francisco a “ridiculous city.”\\nAs we pass a gas station, where regular gas is going for $3.99 a gallon, he notes in frustration that gas where I live is probably significantly cheaper.\\nMy Lyft driver also complains that affordable housing is a joke, saying it means something like a $900,000 for a two-bedroom condo instead of a million. The driver, who moved from Los Angeles to San Francisco 10 years ago, blames San Francisco residents for not allowing more housing, noting it had created a situation where people made a fortune on their own homes’ going up in value but where their children could not afford to buy a home and stay.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe Lyft driver’s attitude isn’t an anomaly: A 2019 survey conducted by the controller’s office found that 35% of respondents were somewhat or very likely to leave the city in the next three years, including 48% of those 35 or younger.\\xa0\\nAlthough the city notes that the 35% number is in line with statistics for the past 14 years, data suggests people aren’t merely talking about leaving the city. According to real estate firm Redfin, San Francisco was second only to New York City among American cities with the dubious distinction of losing the most residents in the third quarter of 2019, the most recent period tracked.\\nAnd my driver isn’t wrong to be concerned about housing prices.\\xa0“In 2010, the median sale price for a single-family house in SF came in at $751,000 … But by October of 2019, the California Association of Realtors estimated that a median-priced SF house sold for $1.65 million, more than double the value of a home the same time ten years ago,” reports Curbed SF.\\nToward the end of the day, I speak to Anthony Rodriguez, who is sitting on a box next to a man smoking in a tent. Next to the tent is a sofa.\\nNeither Rodriguez nor the tent man, who doesn’t want to be quoted, knows where the sofa originated.\\xa0\\nRodriguez is from Oakland, a city across the Bay, but says he’s been in San Francisco for about a month.\\xa0\\n“That’s one thing about San Francisco,” he observes. “You won’t starve.”\\nThe 51-year-old says he’s been homeless since 2015, when his mother died, and that he had been homeless at times prior to that as well.\\xa0\\nRodriguez tells me a complicated story I have trouble following—and entirely believing—about being discharged from a hospital too soon for an injury he incurred on his knee.\\xa0\\n“I started drinking again because it’s cold out,” he mentions.\\nOverall, he likes San Francisco, especially because he meets so many people.\\xa0\\n“If I’m lonely and sad, I always like to come out here,” Rodriguez, who doesn’t want his photo taken, tells me.\\xa0\\nHe says he has seven children, and that he’s outlived two of his ex-wives. It doesn’t appear that he is in regular touch with any family now. \\nThe company he finds in San Francisco “fills a void for me,” he says, noting that he’s less depressed here.\\xa0\\n“The police will wake you up,” Rodriguez says, but adds that it’s usually OK to just go across the street when that happens.\\xa0\\xa0\\nSo am I still a poop skeptic?\\xa0\\nAfter walking all over the city, I’ve seen only one instance of poop (in the Tenderloin neighborhood) and one possible needle (I wasn’t anxious to get close enough to verify)—despite the fact that I kept diligently studying the sidewalk to see if I would spot either feces or needles.\\nMy anonymous Lyft driver, however, says that he regularly sees people shooting up heroin, and notes you can spot the dealers by noticing who has backpacks.\\n#SanFrancisco politicians have been among the most vocal proponents of reducing inequality… Perhaps, their struggle should start closer to home. https://t.co/4nzW2iNLvf pic.twitter.com/uVqDMHfQre\\n“In San Francisco’s Tenderloin neighborhood, ‘Tucker Carlson Tonight’ producers filmed drug dealers operating in broad daylight.\\xa0In the South of Market (SoMa) neighborhood, where many apartments rent for nearly $4,000 a month, the sidewalks were lined with used syringes,” writes Fox News’ Charles Couger.\\nAnd in the course of my research, I encounter Twitter accounts that portray a dirtier reality than what I happened to observe:\\n\"Giant human feces against the wall near the main door of 701 Minna.

But if you’re thinking about a trip to San Francisco, I wouldn’t skip it on account of these matters—just make sure you know where the bad neighborhoods are, and be sure to avoid them if you’re concerned.\\nIn the weeks since I visited San Francisco and started writing this article, I’ve caught myself often thinking about the homeless people I saw—from the man who was barefoot on the street in the Mission District, to those I saw on the sidewalks from my passing car, to the man rushing to pack up his belongings as a worker sprayed the sidewalk near him.\\nI don’t pretend to know the exact policy solution that will “solve” homelessness—although I hope to do further reporting and interviews this year at The Daily Signal to talk to experts who have insightful ideas on ways to help.\\nBut any visitor to San Francisco can tell the current situation isn’t working—for tourists, for residents, and perhaps most importantly, for the homeless themselves.\\nNo doubt, mental health and addiction, perhaps both in many or most cases, make helping the homeless while respecting individual rights uniquely challenging.\\nBut as clichéd as the term is, it’s genuinely heartbreaking to walk through blocks of people, spending their lives on the streets, often seemingly in a drugged haze—and sometimes passed out entirely.\\xa0\\nI can’t imagine tents provide much shelter against the chilly, Bay-driven winds of San Francisco, or that anyone who feels driven to defecate on the street is truly in his right mind.\\nSeeing this at Christmastime—when most of the country was on the cusp of days of joyful celebrations, ample family time, presents galore, and gourmet meals—was especially upsetting.\\nThe status quo in San Francisco has a real human cost.\\nThe left long has prided itself on having more compassion for, and solutions for, the poorest Americans than the right does.\\nBut if one thing is clear when walking around San Francisco, it’s that this liberal bastion has absolutely failed some Americans who are struggling the hardest right now.\\xa0\\nAll photos in this article were taken by the author.

It was at this event that some students crossed the line, according to a letter to the editor submitted by a university administrator and published in the student paper last week. What was their offense? They dared to show pride in their country.\\nAdministrator David Green’s letter reads exactly like the shrill, anti-American prose we’ve come to expect from some members of academia:\\nThe vast majority of 9/11 observances in this country cannot be seen as politically neutral events. Implicit in their nature are the notions that lives lost at the World Trade Center are more valuable than lives lost in Afghanistan, Iraq, Palestine and elsewhere; that the motives of the 9/11 attackers had nothing to do with genuine grievances in the Islamic world regarding American imperialism; and that the U.S. has been justified in the subsequent killing of hundreds of thousands in so-called retaliation.\\nThe observance at Saturday’s football game was no different. A moment of silence was followed by a military airplane flyover; in between, Block-I students chanted “USA, USA.” This was neither patriotism nor remembrance in any justifiable sense, but politicization, militarism, propaganda and bellicosity. The University is a public institution that encompasses the political views of all, not just the most (falsely) “patriotic.” Athletic planners should cease such exploitation for political purposes. They might at least consider how most Muslim students, American or otherwise, would respond to this nativist display; or better, Muslims and others that live their lives under the threat of our planes, drones and soldiers.\\nThe overwhelmingly white, privileged, Block-I students should be ashamed of their obnoxious, fake-macho, chicken-hawk chant, while poverty-drafted members of their cohort fight and die in illegal and immoral wars for the control of oil. University administrators need to eliminate from all events such “patriotic” observances, which in this country cannot be separated from implicit justifications for state-sponsored killing.\\nMr. Green’s\\xa0tirade is like a\\xa0cornucopia\\xa0of just about every liberal screed imaginable. America as imperialists? Yep. Ignorantly slamming our military’s demographics? Of course. Blood for oil? You betcha.\\nThe irony of course is that it is Mr. Green that is politicizing the event, not these students. Not to mention the irony of calling for tolerance while blasting your colleague’s patriotism as “fake” and suggesting that American Muslim students are somehow less patriotic than their peers.\\nElsewhere in the University of Illinois system, word came yesterday that retired University of Illinois at Chicago professor\\xa0Bill Ayers was denied “emeritus” status in a unanimous vote of the Board of Trustees. This after Board Chairman Christopher Kennedy, son of the late Robert F. Kennedy, protested granting the title to a man who dedicated one of his books, in part, to his father’s assassin, Sirhan Sirhan.

His latest book is \"A Pope and a President: John Paul II, Ronald Reagan, and the Extraordinary Untold Story of the 20th Century.\"\\nMargaret Sanger is a saint in the feminist church. She is a charter member of the progressive hall of fame. Liberals revere this woman who preached “race improvement” and denounced what she called “human weeds”.\\nHillary Clinton glows that she is “in awe of” Sanger. She said so in 2009 upon receiving Planned Parenthood’s “highest honor” that year: its coveted Margaret Sanger Award.\\nLikewise effusive was Nancy Pelosi when she proudly accepted the award in 2014.\\nSpeaking to Planned Parenthood a year earlier, President Barack Obama, hailed the organization founded by this racial eugenicist committed to creating a “race of thoroughbreds” and purging America’s “race of degenerates.”\\n“Thank you, Planned Parenthood,” and “God bless you,” said Obama to a giddy crowd of ecstatic women. The president commended Planned Parenthood’s “extraordinary” and “remarkable work,” and told the women they do a “great, great job.”\\nThe love by liberals for Planned Parenthood and its founder seems to know no bounds. A professor, blogging at the New York Times, has argued for placing Margaret’s mug on the $20 bill.\\nAnd alas, even the Smithsonian, America’s museum, boasts a handsome bust of Sanger in its stately National Portrait Gallery.\\n>>> To read more on this topic: 13 Things You Probably Don’t Know About Planned Parenthood Founder Margaret Sanger\\xa0\\nMargaret is there enshrined in the Smithsonian’s vaunted “Struggle for Justice” exhibit.\\nThis brings me to my reason for writing here today: a group of angry African-American pastors are demanding the removal of Sanger’s bust from the Smithsonian.\\nThe letter from Ministers Taking a Stand states:\\n“Perhaps the Gallery is unaware that Ms. Sanger supported black eugenics, a racist attitude toward black and other minority babies, an elitist attitude toward those she regarded as ‘the feeble minded;’ speaking at a rally of Ku Klux Klan women; and communications with Hitler sympathizers. Also the notorious ‘Negro Project,’ which sought to limit, if not eliminate black births, was her brainchild.”\\nThe pastors quote an infamous December 1939 letter from Sanger to Dr. Clarence Gamble of the Eugenics Society, where, in the context of discussing the Negro Project, Sanger wrote: “We do not want word to get out that we want to exterminate the Negro population and the minister is the man who can straighten out the idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members.”\\nThe succinct, powerful statement from the pastors adds: “Despite these well-documented facts of history, her bust sits proudly in your gallery as a hero of justice. The obvious incongruity is staggering!”\\nAmen to that.\\nLiberals must be baffled by this, confusedly scratching their heads.\\nThis isn’t the esteemed Planned Parenthood foundress they learned to admire in their college classrooms.\\nMargaret Sanger, a racist? Huh? They never heard that in American History 101.\\nWhere could these crazy charges possibly come from?\\nThe answer is a myriad of authoritative sources. For starters, one might consult Sanger’s own words. On pages 366-367 of her 1938 autobiography, published by W.W. Norton, one of the leading New York publishing houses, she spoke warmly of her May 1926 speech to the women’s chapter of the KKK in Silverlake, New Jersey.\\nSanger seemed eager to speak to the group. After getting off the train, she was escorted by car along windings roads to a literal barn hidden in the country. There, the undeterred Planned Parenthood matron waited patiently for nearly three hours while her white-hooded sisters engaged in their incendiary routine. She observed “figures parading with banners and illuminated crosses.\\nI waited another twenty minutes. It was warmer and I did not mind so much.” “Eventually,” recorded Sanger of the toasty atmosphere, “the lights were switched on, the audience seated itself, and I was escorted to the platform, was introduced, and began to speak.”\\nSanger was tight-lipped regarding what she shared with the klanswomen at their rally, though apparently she was extremely successful and satisfied with herself:\\n“I believed I had accomplished my purpose. A dozen invitations to speak to similar groups were proffered. The conversation went on and on, and when we were finally through it was too late to return to New York…. It was nearly one before I reached Trenton, and I spent the night in a hotel.”\\nThe Planned Parenthood founder’s KKK talk was a smash hit. Not only did it go very late, after a long wait, but it earned Sanger a dozen new invitations from the klan-sisters. The KKK was quite excited about the work of Planned Parenthood’s founder.\\nThus, it hardly comes out-of-nowhere when a group of African-American pastors today asks the Smithsonian: “How can a person like Sanger, who found common cause with the racial agenda of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), be ranked among true champions of ‘justice?’”\\nPrecisely.\\nSuch words pierce the liberal heart like a dagger. As many conservatives have experienced, when you point out to liberals that Planned Parenthood aborts (by far) a disproportionate number of unborn African-American babies, they go wild with rage and name-calling. You’re apt to be reflexively called everything from a fascist to (hey, why not?) a racist.\\nFor liberals, facing such a stark reality precipitates uncontrollable, irrational outbursts. You can get called every name in the liberal playbook for raising this one.\\nAs we watch weekly the ghastly Planned Parenthood video expose released by the Center for Medical Progress, in which Sanger’s organization’s “medical personnel” nonchalantly discuss dissecting baby parts while gleefully sipping Chianti and nibbling a Caesar’s salad, bear in mind that most of these babies are African-American. Which among them might have been another Rosa Parks, Ben Carson, Martin Luther King Jr., Arthur Ashe, or even Barack Obama?\\nThese African-American pastors know that. Indeed, they show that 70 percent of Planned Parenthood abortion clinics are located in minority neighborhoods. Thus, they’re undertaking their own expose. Their letter, they say, will be but one “in a series of actions we will be taking to expose the evil of honoring Margaret Sanger and Planned Parenthood.”\\nAgain, amen to that.\\nIf liberals genuinely care about justice, they should join these African-American pastors in seeking the removal Margaret Sanger’s bust from the “Struggle for Justice” exhibit at America’s preeminent museum.\\nThis woman is not worthy of enshrinement.',\n",
       " 'Pope John Paul II was struck four times by an attempted assassin\\'s bullets on May 13, 1981. (Photo: Winston Vargas/Flickr)\\n\\nPaul Kengor\\n/\\n@DrPaulKengor\\n\\nPaul Kengor is professor of political science at Grove City College. His latest book is \"A Pope and a President: John Paul II, Ronald Reagan, and the Extraordinary Untold Story of the 20th Century.\"\\nOn May\\xa016, 1985, President Ronald Reagan met with CIA Director William\\xa0J. Casey in the Oval Office.\\nWhat did Reagan and Casey talk about? The official record doesn’t tell us.\\nI dug into all available materials at the Reagan Library and filed Freedom of Information Act requests for the release of records for April and May 1985—phone call transcripts, logs of phone calls made and received, letters, correspondence, memos between Reagan and Casey, and memos between Casey and other members of the Reagan administration.\\nI also requested, for those same two months, the release of any documents by the CIA, the National Security Council, and other groups of interest.\\nNothing refers to the content of the Reagan-Casey conversation on May\\xa016.\\nReagan did mention the meeting in his private diary. In his entry for that day he wrote that “Bill Casey came in” to discuss a Washington Post story on the March car bombing in Beirut that killed more than 80 people.\\nBut as published in “The Reagan Diaries,” the entry ends with a bracketed ellipsis (“[?.?.?.?]”), which reflects an omission in the cleared and approved published account. In other words, here we run into another redaction.\\nThe editor of “The Reagan Diaries,” the historian Douglas Brinkley, writes in his introduction, “The National Security Council\\xa0read all five diary volumes and redacted only about six pages of material for national security reasons.”\\nSo Reagan’s account of this May\\xa016, 1985, meeting with the CIA director appears to be one of the exceedingly rare instances when the National Security Council held back material “for national security reasons.”\\nWhat was happening at this time that could be so sensitive?\\n\\nBy May 1985, investigators looking into the shooting of Pope John Paul\\xa0II were tightening the noose around the Bulgarian communist regime and Moscow (to whom the Bulgarians were dutiful stooges, as was well known in the international intelligence community). Claire Sterling and other journalists had already cast suspicion on the communists with their investigative reporting.\\nItalian prosecutors, meanwhile, had been painstakingly assembling a case. In November 1982 the Italians had arrested the Bulgarian Sergei Antonov, former station chief of the Balkan Air office in Rome, in connection with the assassination attempt.\\nNow, in the spring of 1985, Antonov and other accused conspirators were about to go on trial.\\nAnd the Soviets were coming unhinged. According to the Soviet propaganda sheet Izvestia, Western forces were carefully orchestrating “a conspiracy to conceal a conspiracy.”\\nThis was “the crudest sort of provocation,” Moscow said, intended to “conceal the real culprits and organizers of the terrorist act against the Pope, divert suspicion from them, delude public opinion and keep the true criminals from being exposed and punished.”\\nAnd who were the true criminals? They were the “agents” of “international imperialism,” who resided within Washington’s Beltway.\\nDespite the accusations coming from Moscow, Casey didn’t meet with Reagan on May\\xa016 to discuss a CIA cover-up of U.S. involvement in the pope’s shooting.\\nNo, the truth was that Casey had undertaken his own, secret investigation into the assassination attempt. He had taken an active interest in the case years earlier and was not satisfied with the approach that careerists within the CIA took to the investigation: They tended to dismiss out of hand any suggestion that the Soviet Bloc might have been involved.\\nThe published reports by Sterling, a journalist he respected, had stirred the CIA director to investigate the assassination attempt further.\\nAnd now, in the spring of 1985, Casey was ready to report the findings to his president.\\nRational observers have long suspected that the Soviets were behind the shooting of John Paul\\xa0II. What has not been known—until this book—is that Reagan’s CIA director ordered this extremely sensitive CIA investigation or that the resulting report concluded that Moscow was in fact complicit in the plot to kill the pope.\\nMore specifically, the CIA report concluded that the GRU—Soviet military intelligence—had ordered the assassination.\\nThrough a series of interviews with various sources over the past decade, combined with a thorough search of the documentary record (especially through Freedom of Information Act requests and archival research), I have pieced together how the CIA’s extraordinarily secret investigation came about and what it found.\\n>>> Purchase Paul Kengor’s book, “A Pope and a President: John Paul II, Ronald Reagan, and the Extraordinary Untold Story of the 20th Century”\\nOne source with knowledge of the CIA report told me, “I’ve never, ever, in all my years, seen anything as secretive as that document.”\\nSpeaking of those privileged few who had seen it, most of whom are now deceased, the source added jokingly, “This was so classified that they nearly shot the secretary who typed it.” Few reports, if any, have been so thoroughly kept from view.\\nThe source added, “The document that I’m referring to answers the question [of who planned the shooting of the pope].”\\nAnd what was the answer? As one of the few people who ever saw the report put it to me, the findings can be summarized simply: “The Russians did it.”\\nThe information was so explosive that the report and its dramatic conclusion have never been released or even acknowledged. To this day, it remains the most secret report of the Cold War.\\nKeep in mind the context: Tensions in the Cold War had never run higher. The Soviets had been on the advance in the 1970s, but now Reagan and his partner in the Vatican were standing up to the threat of Soviet communism.\\nThe 1980s intensified fears of World War\\xa0III between two nuclear-armed superpowers. Now imagine if news broke that the U.S. government had discovered a Soviet-orchestrated assassination attempt on the leader of the world’s largest religion, who was a voice for those suffering under Soviet communism.\\n“That report exists,” I have been assured. “If someone can find it, you’ve got the most explosive report of the 20th century.”\\nI have searched tirelessly for the report, examining numerous archives and pursuing many other avenues. I have not found the document, but I know its conclusion, based on eyewitness accounts that high-level sources gave me.\\nI hope my book, “A Pope and a President,” compels action that leads to the release of the report. The evidence is clear: The Soviet GRU ordered the attempted assassination of Pope John Paul\\xa0II.\\nIt’s finally time to declassify this report and any other documents related to the papal assassination attempt, so we can know precisely what happened in what has rightly been called the “crime of the century.”\\nThis excerpt was taken from Paul Kengor’s book, “A Pope and a President: John Paul II, Ronald Reagan, and the Extraordinary Untold Story of the 20th Century” (Intercollegiate Studies Institute, 2017).',\n",

       " 'Dr. Bruce Latham, a family practitioner in Coos County, New Hampshire, says he reports to law enforcement anybody he suspects of selling drugs, including prescription painkillers. (Photo: Josh Siegel/The Daily Signal)\\n\\nCOLEBROOK, N.H.—Bruce Latham, a lanky, self-employed doctor, occupies a unique position in the depths of rural New Hampshire’s opioid drug addiction crisis.\\nAs part of his practice in Colebrook, a town of 2,300 in Coos County, Latham responds to pain by prescribing opioid painkillers. He says he empathizes with patients’ propensity to become addicted to pain medicine because his own son is a recovering drug addict.\\n“I don’t judge these kids because I understand addiction and understand what dopamine does to your brain,” Latham says, describing how opioids target the brain’s reward system by releasing dopamine, a chemical that regulates feelings of pleasure.\\n\\nPart 4 of 5: Police Assault\\xa0on\\xa0Opioids Gets\\xa0Boost From a Family Doctor\\xa0\\nLatham, 63, is also ruthlessly committed to stamping out the illegal use—and spread of—opiates as they decimate Coos County, which has the highest combined death rate due to drugs, alcohol, or suicide in all of New England.\\nOn a recent April afternoon, Latham, a measured, religious man with heavy bags under his eyes, is downright gleeful as he unveils a wad of note cards, bound with a rubber band. Embellishing, the physician says these cards contain the identities of “every opioid drug dealer within 100 miles of Colebrook.”\\nFor the past 10 years, Latham has reported to law enforcement anybody he comes into contact with or knows about who he suspects to have sold or otherwise illicitly misused drugs, including prescription painkillers.\\nSome of these people are his patients, he says, and others are individuals who patients notified him about.\\n“The cards are kind of like a monument to say maybe we are doing something—maybe we are stopping some of this,” Latham says, slapping the stack of note cards against his lap to reflect the urgency of this region’s opioid addiction epidemic. “I am a good Mormon kid. I just don’t like to see people who have problems taken advantage of.”\\n\\nLatham’s dual role—prescribing pain medicine and helping to secure punishment for those who he suspects don’t use it properly—is unusual in Coos County, the poorest, most northern, and least populated of New Hampshire’s 10 counties.\\nHis position is also informal, although Latham doesn’t hide his cooperation with law enforcement.\\nLatham’s office, which looks like a house and is decorated as a private residence, with framed images of Jesus hanging from the walls, is located down the road from the Colebrook Police Department—the agency he principally works with.\\nPatients who receive prescription pain medicine from Latham must sign an agreement that plainly authorizes the doctor to “cooperate” with law enforcement and waives the normally sacred right of confidentiality for patients.\\n\\nLatham says he will stop serving a patient if he suspects he or she is not handling medication responsibly—by using a higher dose than prescribed, selling the drugs, or diverting them to family and friends.\\n“My patients sign a drug agreement,” says Latham, who notes that about 20 of his 2,000 patients are on chronic pain medication. “If you sell, I turn you into the police. I can’t have one person destroy the program.”\\nLatham says patients who are misusing drugs, or know of others who do, are eager to share information because he isn’t a law enforcement official.\\n“The kids know what is happening,” Latham says, adding:\\nThey will give me a name and tell me how much the heroin is going for. They just volunteer it. A lot of these kids have been in trouble with the law. It’s almost like they think, ‘I can’t go to the police with this because I had a problem one time.’ But they can trust me. This marriage between law enforcement [and] physicians has never been made. I am the only one doing this up here.\\n‘Need to Do Something’\\nWhile Latham’s actions may seem out of place, local law enforcement officials here—burdened by limited resources—welcome any form of help they can get.\\nColebrook Police Chief Steve Cass jokes that this town, and others around it, are so small that he “pretty much knows everybody,” and if he doesn’t, “then I know somebody who does.”\\nCass, 43, memorizes phone numbers—as he demonstrates to a reporter who tests him—and can recite most residents’ first and last names just by looking at them.\\n“I am a nut like that,” says Cass, who was born in Coos and intends to remain here because he loves living in a rural area where he can “step out on the back porch in my drawers and shoot my shotgun off.”\\nColebrook Police Chief Steve Cass sometimes does patrols to supplement his nine-officer force. (Photo: Josh Siegel/The Daily Signal)\\nThe chief says his agency is the only full-time police department in the area. Many of Coos County’s towns are unincorporated, and don’t have police departments.\\nThe Coos County Sheriff’s Office, meanwhile, doesn’t handle criminal cases and focuses on civil services such as transporting inmates to various correctional facilities and providing security in state and federal courts.\\nCass says he uses information provided by Latham just like any other tip he might receive, as a supplement to tactics the police department uses to combat drug crime, including enlisting confidential informants and doing undercover drug buys.\\n“I am willing to listen to anybody who wants to provide information,” Cass tells The Daily Signal in an interview, adding:\\nI’ve been around here long enough to know if someone wants to talk to me, I am going to listen. While Bruce [Latham] definitely has a finger on the pulse of the region, what he tells me is like anything you hear on the street about someone who is dealing pills or a narcotic. I have to make a case. I can’t just take what you say and go and do a search warrant. The information in itself doesn’t mean you can take down somebody.\\nCass says Latham isn’t employed by, nor does he have any formal relationship with, the police department. The partnership has limits—the department does not share information with Latham about active investigations.\\n\\nLatham says he first offered assistance to the police department about 10 years ago in response to a rash of opioid overdose deaths. Latham, who is originally from New Jersey, had just moved to northern New Hampshire to respond to a need for physicians.\\n“I remember the chief saying, ‘You see the smile on my face? You are the first doctor ever to walk into my office and be willing to help us.’ I said, ‘Chief, we have a major problem in this town. Every year we are losing 10 kids from drug overdoses. We need to do something. We have to work as a team on this.’”\\nIn the view of Cass and Latham, if they could reduce illegal sources of drugs from the streets, there would be fewer drugs for people to become addicted to—and potentially die from.\\n“You don’t know all the things you prevented, but if you save one life it’s worth it to me,” Cass says.\\n‘Very Bad Information’\\nBut still, some in the medical community question whether it’s proper—or effective—for a physician to take an aggressive approach in working with police.\\nBefore Latham started his own practice in Colebrook in 2007, he was employed by the Indian Stream Health Center, the largest medical provider in Coos County.\\nThis series:\\nPart 1: The Crisis That May Have Swung Voters From Obama to Trump\\nPart 2: One Opioid Addict Helps Another Choose Life Over Death\\nPart 3: ‘Dr. Father Pill’ Wants to Be Part of the Solution\\nPart 4: Police Assault\\xa0on\\xa0Opioids Gets\\xa0Boost From a Family Doctor\\xa0\\nPart 5: The First Responders Who Witness a Dreadful Toll\\nJohn Fothergill, a physician there who is also a state representative, hired Latham. He spent about a year at Indian Stream, the county’s leading prescriber of pain medication.\\nFothergill says patients often report to him potential misuse of opioids he prescribed to others, but he treats these claims skeptically.\\n“The problem we have at the health center is the information we get from the public is very bad information in general,” Fothergill tells The Daily Signal in an interview. “Frequently, if person A won’t sell drugs to person B, person B may call the health center and say person A is selling drugs—just because he’s mad at him.”\\nFothergill, 62, says opioid users who become addicts learn to lie to feed their addiction, and physicians aren’t in a position to determine the truth.\\n“I have had patients in the past say one thing, and then they have a come-to-Jesus moment and say, ‘I was lying,’” Fothergill says. “I don’t take much of it to heart—or at least I don’t take much of it to the police. A lot of these people certainly have problems. They are addicted to drugs, and to expect them to behave like honest citizens is somewhat unrealistic.”\\nIndian Stream works with law enforcement only in limited circumstances, Fothergill says, in situations where medical staff suspects easier-to-prove illegal activity, such as when a patient tampers with a urine sample during a drug test in order to be prescribed more medication.\\n“We certainly have a relationship with law enforcement,” Fothergill says. “They talk to us. We talk to them.”\\n\\nFothergill argues that it is wrong for medical providers to apply their own zero-tolerance policy to opioids misuse, because addiction—which can drive illegal activity—is best addressed through treatment.\\nIndian Stream requires patients who receive prescription pain medicine for 28 days or longer to participate in a substance abuse class or group therapy.\\n“People have to fail multiple times before we say we are really not helping you, you need to go some place else,” Fothergill says. “In our program, we expect them to be honest, but we try to provide increased help instead of just throwing them out.”\\n‘Sticky Thing’\\nJohn McCormick, Coos County’s attorney and chief law enforcement officer, appreciates the challenges in approaching a drug epidemic fueled by both legal and illegal behavior.\\nMcCormick, who has a soft voice and cerebral demeanor, is contemplative as he discusses the circumstances in which he believes drug-related crime should be met with punishment rather than second chances.\\nJohn McCormick, Coos County attorney, says drug overdose deaths in the county decreased last year. But he says work remains to beat the opioid addiction crisis. (Photo: Josh Siegel/The Daily Signal)\\nReflecting on the nuances of his job, he reveals to a reporter the number of drug overdose deaths in Coos reported to him in recent years—12 in 2015, nine in 2016, a few likely already this year, although it’s too early to know for sure.\\n“To beat this, I think it’s got to be sort of a multipronged approach,” McCormick tells The Daily Signal, sitting on a broken desk chair in his undecorated office. He adds:\\nI can tell you that some folks I have seen through the criminal justice system, I almost want to say they are almost in a better place in jail than outside of jail. I have seen addiction cases where if you let this person free, they are going to die. It’s that bad.\\n\\nThe county attorney, who has been in his position for nearly five years, adds that he has seen defendants die of a drug overdose before they go to trial for a drug-related case.\\n“We are not here to just throw everyone in jail,” McCormick says. “I don’t think we can just prosecute our way out of this. Treatment is worth a try. If they are not ready to receive that help or are not accepting it, the other alternative is jail.”\\nAt the federal level, Attorney General Jeff Sessions has signaled a tougher approach to drug crime, recently ordering federal prosecutors to charge suspects with the most serious offense they can prove. But, McCormick says, it’s important to see each case for its unique characteristics.\\n\\nMcCormick says he usually reserves the most severe charges for suspects selling large quantities of drugs and for out-of-towners who travel to Coos County to sell drugs—usually from the Boston area—to take advantage of the demand. Repeat offenders also deserve stronger punishment, he says:\\nIt’s kind of a sticky thing. I am aware of the addiction aspect, of course. I think I differentiate between someone who sells to use, and someone who sells just to profit; however, those lines are blurred. Every defense attorney will say their client is dealing to use.\\nMcCormick, who knows Latham but doesn’t work directly with the doctor, says it’s challenging even for law enforcement to confirm the intent behind suspected illegal activity related to drugs.\\n“In these kind of cases, credibility is king,” McCormick says. “Sometimes you have to take what folks say with a grain of salt. Certainly, if they are serious addicts, we want to make them rehabilitate. At the same time, sometimes they know how to tell a good lie and manipulate folks in order to keep using. It’s a tough thing. We aren’t human lie detectors. It’s hard to sometimes tell whether someone is genuine.”\\n‘There Is Hope’\\nSeeking the proper balance between punishment and treatment, McCormick, Cass, and Latham all sound hopeful about a potential solution.\\nCoos County, working with the state, is in the process of creating a drug court.\\nIn such a specialty court for offenders with substance abuse problems, defendants are able to access treatment services as an alternative to incarceration.\\nAs the defendant receives treatment, he or she checks in periodically with the court, which closely monitors progress and can impose sanctions if the offender commits a new crime.\\nIn August, McCormick is planning to travel to Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, a small, rural community, to observe how it runs its drug court.\\nWith state funding committed, McCormick says he expects a drug court to come online in Coos County within a year.\\n\\nHe is careful not to portray a drug court as a panacea to the opioid crisis, however:\\nThe idea is you get a little more supervision and oversight. I am cautiously optimistic it may have an impact and help at least some of the folks who are dependent on substances to steer away from illegal activity. I don’t want to say it’s not a solution. I don’t know if it will be a solution. But it can’t hurt.\\nLatham, the physician, says a drug court could achieve the difficult balance of providing an opportunity for people to better themselves, while also imposing consequences for those who continue to violate the law.\\n“My son was a heroin addict and has pretty much turned his life around,” Latham says of his only son, Chris, who was 15 when he started using drugs and is now in his 30s, married, and the father of a daughter.\\n“I am proud of the boy,” Latham says. “So I would say there is hope. It’s like that saying, you can’t change the spots on a leopard. I don’t treat leopards. I treat human beings, and they can change.”\\nNext, in Part 5 of 5: The first responders who witness the dreadful toll of opioid addiction.',\n",
       " 'Montgomery County Police Department Chief Thomas Manger testifies in 2015 at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on U.S. immigration enforcement policies. (Photo: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters\\n/Newscom)\\nTwo years ago, a suburban Maryland county began to see a dramatic rise in killings attributed to MS-13, an international gang with ties to Central America.\\nIn response, the Montgomery County Police Department assigned Capt. Paul Liquorie, a 23-year veteran of the police force, to lead a centralized street gang unit dedicated to stomping out the violence.\\nIn an interview with The Daily Signal, Liquorie, 49, director of the department’s Special Investigations Division, described law enforcement’s approach to combating MS-13 in this affluent county just outside Washington, D.C.\\nSince August 2015, Liquorie said, the county has suffered seven MS-13-related homicides.\\n“The Latino community where MS-13 has a presence is terrified,” Liquorie said.\\nThe Trump administration repeatedly has invoked the threat of MS-13, making the gang a central focus of its effort to enforce immigration laws aggressively.\\nLiquorie, in a Q&A below, describes MS-13’s increasing “brutality and callousness” and how Montgomery County works with federal law enforcement to find and prosecute the gang’s members.\\n“Law enforcement won’t tolerate this,” Liquorie said of the violence and other crimes associated with MS-13.\\nThe Daily Signal: How long has MS-13 been present in Montgomery County, and what’s different about their activity in the county now?\\nLiquorie: It always has been a priority because MS-13 has such a presence here in the county.\\nWhat we attribute to MS-13 is that since August of 2015, we’ve had seven MS-13-related homicides where we believe the perpetrators are MS-13 and two victims we believe were MS-13.\\nOne of the things most alarming recently is the number of homicides, and the brutality and callousness by which they occur.\\nWhat I mean by that is the reasoning behind the violence may just be someone flashing a gang sign on the internet, or someone who may be believed to be a rival gang member.\\nThe murders are not done in the sense of to gain greater territory or monetary benefits for the gang itself.\\nAnother alarming thing is how [MS-13 leaders] try to get junior members to rise in status. To prove your loyalty in the gang, you will have to commit a homicide to get the full confidence of the gang in your abilities.\\nWhat we have seen regularly in recent years is just the brutality of the violence. People are lured into wooded areas, [and] usually stabbed with some sort of edged weapon multiple times.\\nCapt. Paul Liquorie, 49, director of the Montgomery County Police Department’s Special Investigations Division, is charged with leading a gang unit that targets MS-13. (Photo courtesy of Capt. Paul Liquorie)\\nThe other thing we have seen change in recent years is they want anyone who is present to be actively involved in the violence.\\nRather than one person stabbing the victim, and two others being there on the periphery, they want everybody to stab the body multiple times to say now we are all equally culpable and you will be less likely to snitch or make a deal with prosecutors because you were also involved.\\nYou are just as culpable.\\nWhen someone is shot, there is a level of distance. To stab someone is a very personal act. You have to be up close to that person and be right with them as they are dying.\\nQ: How has the escalation in violence that you are describing been impacted by the flood of unaccompanied Central American youth who have settled in the area in recent years? Are those recent arrivals targeted for gang recruitment?\\nA: Even outside the gang, there is a different status [perceived] between these new arrivals, these unaccompanied minors, and established immigrants. That means these kids further become alienated.\\nThey don’t fit in at school. Some of them might not fit in at home. They come here hopefully trying to flee violence in their country, so whoever is their sponsor here, those people, many may be struggling economically already and are taking on this additional economic burden of sponsoring someone else.\\nThe gang can come to you and can fill these voids, and that makes [the new arrivals] very susceptible to be gang members.\\nWe see a grooming process very similar to what you would see with pedofiles to gain people’s trust.\\nA lot of these kids are in over their heads before they know it.\\nQ: Are the victims of MS-13 violence randomly targeted? What traits characterize the victims?\\nA: In the vast majority of them, we have been very successful in prosecuting the perpetrator of these crimes, and we have some [cases] that still remain open, where we hear through our investigation that the victims may have had ties to MS-13.\\nThere is usually some affiliation with the gang. They may not be full-fledged members, but there may be some kind of action by the victim that leads [MS-13] to believe they are a rival gang member.\\nQ: What kind of crime does MS-13 involve itself with? What drives them to violence?\\nA: Mexican and Columbian cartels—in the amount of power they hold and the financial holdings they have—have a lock on the drug market. So it’s hard for MS-13 to really get a foothold in the drug market. So they really get whatever local markets are left over—whatever those organizations are willing to allow MS-13 to do.\\nWhat you see locally is their main form of revenue is extortion. Originally we would see that limited to underground economies, bordellos—or houses of prostitution—[and] cantinas—or unlicensed bars and restaurants that might serve ethnic food as well as beer and wine.\\n\\nPeople without status here usually don’t have IDs to get alcohol, so you have this underground economy that serves this clientele. The gang is not running those businesses, but extorting them, providing quote-unquote “protection.”\\nWhat we are starting to see and [are] working on is that MS-13 is extorting from legitimate businesses within the Hispanic community. Anecdotally, you are seeing that with apartment complexes where there are a large amount of Hispanic residents.\\n[MS-13] are consistently looking for people and saying, “We will provide you protection to live in this community.”\\nThe other case you hear anecdotally is where there are legitimate businesses, beer and wine stores for example, of El Salvadorian descent whose proprietors are being threatened by the gang to provide liquor to them and sell to these illicit cantinas. They use social media to realize who the proprietor of the business is, to figure out who their family members are in El Salvador, and they then threaten to do harm to them.\\nThat is outside the reach of American law enforcement. That’s a very difficult problem to work on.\\nQ: How do you work with federal law enforcement to combat MS-13?\\nA: We are working closely with the U.S. Attorney’s Office in recent months. We have a large RICO [Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act] case where we have 15 gang members who have been federally indicted and are being prosecuted.\\nJust like we do with other federal task forces, we have our [Montgomery County Police Department] members on the joint terrorism task force and DEA [Drug Enforcement Agency] task force. Similarly, we have task forces looking at gang activity as well.\\nWe work with the Department of Homeland Security’s investigations arm to try to look at the gang holistically and target the organization as a whole to include its hierarchy.\\nQ: What is the Montgomery County Police Department’s approach to combating MS-13?\\nA: We take a holistic or “whole of government” approach.\\nWe have three pillars: prevention, intervention, and suppression, based on best practices from gang programs throughout the country. What you see in Montgomery County on the preventative side is the Recreation Department of the county government going into neighborhoods where there are at-risk youth, to provide positive alternatives so they don’t fall under the lure of the gang.\\nMontgomery County [Public] Schools is doing similar things.\\nIntervention falls under the county’s Health and Human Services Department with street outreach, doing outreach in neighborhoods providing the full gamut of services: social, mental health, and other ways that may strengthen the family network and trying to find what’s best to help the child and family divert from gang activity.\\nLast is the suppression, that falls on the police. All police officers are tasked with [fighting] criminal activity.\\nQ: Why is Montgomery County vulnerable to MS-13? In other words, why is MS-13 so active in the county?\\nA: You see that we have a large enclave in the greater D.C. area of Central Americans and a certain percent, a small percentage, are going to be gang members or targeted by gang members.\\nI can tell you stories anecdotally where somebody starts into the gang and acquiesces and hopes they can limit their activity in the gang and says, “I will just do enough to be a part of the gang and not be targeted by them anymore.” But that starts the grooming process that goes on. There are others in MS-13 that are attached to the power and influence, but there are some who join the gang reluctantly.\\nMS-13 has become more prominent locally. We have seen the acts are becoming more isolated in the Hispanic community and that’s the double-edged sword for us. You hear from nonprofit organizations that work in these communities, and from school resource officers, that the Latino community where MS-13 has a presence is terrified. At the same time, that also makes them fearful to come forward to report.\\nOne of the things I have been trying to emphasize is that the community’s silence is the gang’s strength.\\nQ: The Trump administration has pledged to aggressively target MS-13 and to deport its members. Can tougher immigration enforcement help combat MS-13 in Montgomery County?\\nA: I don’t really want to go there. But I will say, clearly, if you look not only at Montgomery County, but other law enforcement agencies across the U.S. that have large immigrant populations, they have all taken the same stance that it’s hard enough for the community to come forward to tell us activities that are going on with the gang.\\nIf that same community also fears they will be deported if they come forward, that is just one other factor that prevents us from getting an understanding of what is going on in those communities, and it’s one more reason for the community not to go forward.\\nQ: How would you assess the progress you have made in combating MS-13? Do you think MS-13 will always have a presence in Montgomery County?\\nA: I think we are in a good place right now. Some of the things the [Trump] administration has been talking about have been ongoing in Montgomery County and the greater D.C. area.\\nWe are using all our resources at the local and federal level to go after MS-13. The violence, it’s clear to us that it is something that can’t be tolerated in the community.\\nI don’t know if we can totally eliminate MS-13, but you can target the gang and its hierarchy and put pressure on them.\\nWith every successful prosecution and case we bring that tells [MS-13] that they can’t continue to operate the way they have, we are sending the message that law enforcement won’t tolerate this.\\nThe more successful we have community participation in some of these prosecutions, the more that will help us as well. When the greater community comes forward and says, “Look, we have had enough and we will come to the police to help,” that is a positive sign as well.',\n",
       " 'Moses Henry and Steven Blaisdell depend on Friendship House, a residential drug treatment center in Bethlehem, New Hampshire, to recover from opioid addiction. (Photo: Josh Siegel/The Daily Signal)\\nBETHLEHEM, N.H.—They came to be addicted to drugs in different ways, but ended up in the same place.\\nSteven Blaisdell, 26, a stocky, shy son of a mailman, was first prescribed pain medicine—the opioid OxyContin—as a teenager after he flipped over his four-wheeler and broke his left femur in half.\\nOver the past 14 years, Blaisdell has had surgery seven times as a result of recreational injuries that are common here in “North Country,” where young men treat the outdoors—mountains, ski jumps, and hiking trails—like a playground.\\n\\nPart 2 of 5: One Opioid Addict Helps Another Choose Life Over Death\\nWhen he sits down, Blaisdell’s left shoulder droops lower than his right, dragged down by a 9-inch plate, the result of a dirt bike accident.\\nBlaisdell says his pain went away when he took up to 15 OxyContin pills per day, much more than he was prescribed.\\nAfter doctors stopped prescribing him the painkiller, Blaisdell—21 years old at the time and arthritic from repeated physical trauma—turned to heroin, a cheaper, illicit opioid, smoking it instead of injecting it because he’s scared of needles.\\n“From the time I was 13, doctors were pushing me pain pills as a safe alternative,” Blaisdell tells The Daily Signal four days after he relapsed on heroin over the Easter holiday, ending his latest attempt at sobriety. “I was prescribed pretty high amounts of them for a long time. I didn’t really have a lot of education growing up or warning about addiction until I was already addicted. So that’s kind of how it started for me.”\\nMoses Henry, 35, small in stature and blunt in speech, with body tattoos and face piercings, says he sought out drugs to fit in with friends.\\nHenry started with pot at 12 years old, graduated to cocaine at 15, and became addicted to OxyContin by the time he was 18, attracted to the stronger high and ease of purchase on the streets.\\n“I wasn’t in pain,” says Henry, who nearly died after he overdosed in the bathroom of his parents’ house over a year ago. “Drugs brought me up. I could do anything I wanted to do on OxyContin, on opioids. I am my own worst enemy.”\\nOn just another foggy, gray late April day in northern New Hampshire, Blaisdell and Henry sit next to each other at a picnic table inside the poorly lit kitchen of a dilapidated, secluded cottage. This is the region’s only residential drug treatment center.\\n\\nFriendship House, as the place is called, is where Blaisdell and Henry took themselves before it was too late.\\nBlaisdell and Henry are both from Coos County, which has the highest combined death rate due to drugs, alcohol, or suicide in all of New England, comprising counties in six states.\\nThe death rate is defined as the number of drug-related, alcohol-related, and suicide deaths per 100,000 people.\\nCoos County, New Hampshire’s poorest, also is the state’s largest county by land mass but smallest according to population.\\nDriving through the county’s numerous tiny and nearly deserted towns, where cellphone service becomes scarcer as a visitor creeps north—closer to the Canadian border—it’s difficult to appreciate how anybody could know anybody, because there doesn’t seem to be anybody living here.\\nA recent senior class at Pittsburg High School, in Coos County’s northernmost town, graduated one person.\\nBut many of the county’s 30,000 residents are related by drug addiction, familiar with the region’s—and nation’s–opioid epidemic in some way.\\n“I can spot another addict from a mile away,” Henry says, motioning a couple feet away to his right, at Blaisdell. “You try to escape it, but it’s hard.”\\nIn Recovery, ‘Short Window of Opportunity’\\nBlaisdell and Henry are in the same residence, but at different stages of recovery.\\nHenry is employed as a “recovery coach” at Friendship House, where he became sober 14 months ago as a resident here. He is mentoring Blaisdell, who is voluntarily participating in a 90-day, low-intensity residential treatment program, designed to support drug users in the early stages of recovery.\\nThis series:\\nPart 1: The Crisis That May Have Swung Voters From Obama to Trump\\nPart 2: One Opioid Addict Helps Another Choose Life Over Death\\nPart 3: ‘Dr. Father Pill’ Wants to Be Part of the Solution\\nPart 4: Police Assault\\xa0on\\xa0Opioids Gets\\xa0Boost From a Family Doctor\\xa0\\nPart 5: The First Responders Who Witness a Dreadful Toll\\nServing New Hampshire’s three most northern counties, including Coos, Friendship House offers individual and family counseling, group therapy, and a place to live in a structured setting.\\nMany of the residents are homeless before they come here. Blaisdell and Henry both have been homeless at points of their addiction.\\nThe facility, a one-story, wood-frame building in a wooded area that looks like a camp site, is not up to code and has only 18 beds. That’s not enough to serve the Northern Country, the upper third of New Hampshire, says Friendship House’s director, Kristy Letendre.\\nKristy Letendre, Friendship House’s director, says “there is a short window of opportunity” to help opioid addicts recover when they seek treatment. (Photo: Josh Siegel/The Daily Signal)\\nNew Hampshire has the second-lowest level of access to substance abuse treatment in the nation, above only Texas, according to the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.\\nFriendship House is a part of the Tri-County Community Action Program, a nonprofit that also offers services to the homeless, elderly, and victims of sexual and domestic abuse.\\nLetendre says Friendship House recently received a federal Community Development Block Grant to construct a new building that meets code requirements and will allow the center to expand to 32 beds. As part of that expansion, the Tri-County Community Action Program recently merged with North Country Health Consortium, a similar nonprofit provider.\\n\\nLetendre says growth is necessary because she regularly has to turn down drug addicts who want to stay at Friendship House, with individuals facing a wait time that can span four to six weeks.\\nThat delay could be too long to make a difference.\\n“There is a short window of opportunity when you are talking to somebody who is ready to give up using,” says Letendre, a hard-charging 38-year-old who wears dangling earrings and a jean jacket.\\n“If they make a call to you at that point, they are hopeless, they have burned every bridge, and they are going to die if they continue to use,” Letendre adds, pounding a table for emphasis, her wrist jewelry clanking:\\nIf they pick up the phone and call me, if I can bring them right in, I have a chance to save that life. If I can’t bring them in, and have to tell them they have to wait to get into treatment services, at that point they lose hope. ‘No one cares about me, I don’t care if I live or die.’ You are playing Russian roulette. So they go out and use, and when they use, that is when you see the overdose.\\n‘Easier to Die’\\nHenry says he became committed to recovery after overdosing for the seventh—and latest—time in January 2016.\\nHe was revived by his father, who gave him CPR for seven minutes on the bathroom floor of the family home before the ambulance came.\\n“That look in his eyes really destroyed me,” Henry says of his father, who before this most intimate of moments had not been on speaking terms with his son. “I don’t know what he said to me. I can tell you what I said to him. I asked him where my drugs were and why did you even bother reviving me. Because it was easier to die at that moment. It was the easiest way out. I didn’t want to do what I needed to do to get sober. Because it’s hard work. It was easier to just give up on everything.”\\nAs his parents drove him to Friendship House from their home in Berlin, Coos’ only city, Henry says he injected a gram and a half of heroin.\\n\\nHenry had been to Friendship House once before, eight years ago now, but quickly relapsed after he detoxed.\\n“I am an addict, and I’m sorry,” Henry says. “It didn’t work out the first time, but I didn’t put any effort into my recovery.”\\nHe says he was inspired to recover after he read a handwritten letter by his 14-year-old niece, Padence, who calls him Uncle Mosey.\\nIn the letter, which Henry provided to The Daily Signal, Padence writes that she feared her uncle “would die before I was able to have him in my life again.”\\nPadence has seen Henry high on drugs.\\n“I never truly had my uncle in my life for my whole life,” Padence recalls, in neat handwriting and flawless spelling:\\nI got to have him for a little while. But I never held on too much cause I would always lose him again. Because I love him, it was hard. After a while, I couldn’t stand seeing him. I never hated him, but I hated the things he did and who he became.\\nAt his lowest points, Henry took 10 grams of heroin a day, he says, and stole from his parents and grandparents to feed his drug addiction. It was a stark fall.\\nHe had lived a middle-class childhood provided by his father, who worked in a paper mill before the industry dissolved over the past 20 years. He says his parents never drank or used drugs.\\nHenry says he started and ran his own carpentry business for eight years, claiming that he made six figures at 18 years old.\\n‘It Gets Easier, but Harder Too’\\nToday, Henry aspires to go to college to become a drug and alcohol counselor, and he’s here to articulate to Blaisdell the challenges of recovery.\\nThis is also Blaisdell’s second stay at Friendship House.\\nThe first time, he remained sober for an intensive 28-day program, where he detoxed off the opioid drugs.\\nBut shortly after leaving, Blaisdell relapsed, using heroin on Easter to escape from family pressures, he says.\\n“He didn’t fail,” Henry says reassuringly of Blaisdell, who was living in a homeless shelter at the time of his relapse. “It’s a speed bump. I told him don’t beat himself up over it. It does happen. It’s hell. Addiction is hell. What he’s going through—it gets easier, but it gets harder too.”\\nBlaisdell says he’s in a better position to stay sober now that he has detoxed once and experienced the symptoms of withdrawal.\\n“The best way I can describe it is to say it’s like when you are very hungry or very thirsty and it just takes over your mind and it’s all you can think about,” Blaisdell says. “Where am I going to get my next meal, where am I going to get my next dose [of drugs]? Getting the next dose is really all you think about. The opioid withdrawals are so intense that you become quite fearful when you go through it.”\\n\\nLetendre says Blaisdell’s experience is typical for an addict. Repeated use of an opioid, she says, can alter an individual’s brain chemistry and lead to physical and psychological dependence.\\nOpiates change the way the brain responds to pain and can produce a “high” feeling, disrupting the brain’s reward and pleasure centers. Without the drug, the body may not feel what it learned to know as normal, leading to withdrawal symptoms such as sweats, muscle aches, vomiting, and diarrhea.\\n“When our body builds this physical dependence, the withdrawal is severe and immediate,” Letendre says. “The user will do everything they possibly can to get the money to get their fix.”\\n‘Keep Up His Habit’\\nWhile Blaisdell says he chose on his own volition to come to Friendship House to get better, his experience here may have an outsize impact on his future.\\nIn September 2016, according to court records obtained by The Daily Signal, Blaisdell was indicted in Coos County Superior Court on multiple felony charges of selling heroin and fentanyl—a more powerful synthetic pain medication—and engaging in a conspiracy to sell drugs.\\nBlaisdell made $10,000 bail—paid by his father—and has a pretrial hearing scheduled for September.\\nHis court-appointed attorney, Joseph Garrison, says Blaisdell sold drugs to a state police officer who was undercover.\\nGarrison, in an interview with The Daily Signal, says Blaisdell told him he sold drugs to make money to feed his own addiction. In New Hampshire, Garrison says, Class B felonies, with which Blaisdell\\xa0has been charged, are punishable by a maximum sentence of three to seven years in state prison.\\n“Unfortunately, Steven’s situation is far too common right now,” Garrison says. “He became addicted, and based on my understanding, it was one of these things where he was trying to keep up his habit. He’s not big time. He’s not like a giant dealer. It’s more a personal-use type situation. He’s a really nice guy who just has a really severe drug problem.”\\nGarrison, who represents clients in New Hampshire’s three northernmost counties—Coos, Grafton, and Carroll—says half of his caseload involves drug-related offenses. [Note: When first published, this report incorrectly said Groveton rather than Grafton.]\\n\\nHe advises clients such as Blaisdell to seek treatment before trial to show they want to overcome their drug problem.\\n“I have too many of these cases,” Garrison says, adding:\\nI have clients who overdose and die before trial. I have had clients go out and commit more crime. Steven is taking this to heart, which is a huge silver lining in the case. Our hope is we can keep that going so he stays sober and makes better choices in the future.\\nBlaisdell, for his part, acknowledges to The Daily Signal that he is charged with drug-related crimes, although he does not admit directly to selling drugs.\\n“What most people don’t realize is that a lot of the dealers are addicts themselves and they are just trying to get by,” Blaisdell says.\\nHe insists his ambition to fulfill Friendship House’s treatment program is genuine, and not just about looking good for court.\\n“I want to get better,” Blaisdell says. “That’s why I am here. Can I imagine going back to drugs? I can imagine it, but it’s absolutely not what I want. This addiction has taken my independence from me. It’s ruined every relationship I ever had. I am now just starting to make amends with my older sisters and getting my family back—and my life. You become very selfish. I’m always one of the last people to ask people for help. I always wait until it’s either too late or close to it.”\\nLetendre, the Friendship House director, knows about Blaisdell’s criminal charges. She says she’s had plenty of residents who’ve relapsed during their path to recovery, and she didn’t consider Blaisdell’s recent slip-up in deciding whether to give him another opportunity.\\nShe says without treatment, Blaisdell—facing prison time—could experience a worse outcome.\\n“When a person says, ‘I need help to save my life,’ absolutely they are usually ready,” Letendre says. “If I can’t that first time, I hope that second time I can help.”\\n‘Hope in a Small Rural Community’\\nFor addicts in the North Country, the path to get better is especially steep, because the reminders—and temptations—of drug abuse are so close.\\n“I know a lot of people in active use,” Henry says. “You know, I have buried seven or eight friends in the past year. Two brothers OD’d within a week of each other. That mother buried two kids within two weeks.”\\nDespite the bleakness around them, Blaisdell and Henry say they want to spend the rest of their lives in or near Coos County. They see beauty where others see economic struggle and pain.\\n“North Country has a lot of resilience,” Henry says. “I love the outdoors, I love the four seasons.”\\nTo find fulfillment in Coos County and live drug-free, Henry and Letendre advise Blaisdell to strive to make new friends, to form a peer group of sober-minded people like he has at Friendship House.\\n“Moses [Henry] is the hope in a small rural community,” Letendre says, explaining:\\nIf you are going back to a community that has nothing but your old dealers, what are you going to do? How are you going to change your friends? How are you going to make connections? You need to have a safe place—strong support when you go home.\\nAddiction is like chronic illness. It’s never going go away. There is no cure for it. All we can do is provide support, provide education. A person can be successful when that person has everything in place for them. Relapse is inevitable unless those supports are in place.\\n\\nBlaisdell says he is on good terms with his parents, after years in which they refused to speak with him.\\n“I believe my family is 100 percent supportive of me being here,” Blaisdell says. “If they aren’t willing to accept me, all I can do is the best I can. If they aren’t willing to accept my apology, I just got to move on or maybe try again.”\\nCurrently unemployed, Blaisdell says he wants to return to working as a mechanic. In high school, he says, he earned certification for state inspections, although he struggled to hold down related jobs because of his addiction.\\nAt Friendship House, Blaisdell takes out the trash and cleans toilets.\\n“It’s good to know I can do the job and know it’s done right,” he says. “I live here, and want it to be clean and sanitary.”\\nFriendship House prescribes chores to instill discipline and ownership as part of recovery.\\nIt’s a sort of return to childhood—before the drugs—that Blaisdell says he embraces.\\n“The drug lifestyle leads nowhere,” Blaisdell says. “It just brings pain and eventually death. A lot of addicts know that, but they are just scared to give it up. I figure if I put half the effort into being sober as I did being an addict, I know I can do it.”\\nNext, in Part 3: Meet the doctor who helped create the local opioid addiction crisis, and see what he’s doing to help solve it.',\n",
       " 'Donald Trump, pictured campaigning for president in Manchester, New Hampshire, never traveled to Coos County but won the poor county decisively. The result is an example of how Trump performed especially well in counties with high death rates from drugs, alcohol, or suicide. (Photo: Keiko Hiromi/Polaris\\n/Newscom)\\nCOLEBROOK, N.H.—His left foot in a walking boot after surgery, Rick Samson, an independent-minded county commissioner in the northernmost part of New Hampshire, is behind the wheel of his pickup truck, describing how this region—“North Country” to locals—is used to going it alone.\\n“I run as a Republican, however I consider myself neither a Republican or Democrat, or conservative, or liberal—I am an American and that’s where it starts,” Samson, 70, says in a New England accent that reveals exactly where he’s from.\\nSo it’s totally within character for the people of Coos County, whom Samson serves, to depend on themselves to overcome the county’s distinction as the place with the highest combined death rate due to drugs, alcohol, or suicide in all of New England.\\n\\nPart 1 of 5: The Crisis That May Have Swung Voters From Obama to Trump\\n“This is how the North Country works: We are collaborative, it’s not territorial; we try to do the best that we can and spread it out because we have so little,” Samson says. “We don’t have a lot.”\\nCoos County, part of “North Country,” the term locals use to define the northern third of New Hampshire, is the poorest in the state. The county is New Hampshire’s largest by area—1,830 square miles—containing numerous tiny towns spread far apart—and the smallest by population, with its 33,000 people representing less than 3 percent of the state.\\nCoos County has long had high rates of alcohol addiction. In recent years, though, opioids—mainly legally prescribed painkillers, but also the more potent and addictive heroin—have become the substance most abused.\\nCoos, like many other places in the U.S., is amid an epidemic of opioid overdoses.\\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, opioids—including prescription drugs as well as heroin—killed more than 33,000 Americans in 2015, more than in any previous year. Opioids now kill more people than car accidents; in 2015, more heroin deaths occurred nationwide than homicides involving guns.\\n\\nNew Hampshire has the second-highest drug overdose rate among all states, with 34 deaths per 100,000 residents\\xa0in 2015.\\nBoth of Samson’s parents were alcoholics, he says, and his youngest daughter’s husband died from alcoholism.\\n“I am very familiar with addiction,” Samson tells The Daily Signal as he speeds his truck deeper into the low fog hovering over a winding, deserted road, with few people and passing vehicles in sight.\\nCoos County also suffers from severe economic distress related to the loss of manufacturing jobs.\\nIn 1980, manufacturing jobs comprised 38 percent of all jobs in Coos. In 2014, only 7 percent of jobs in the county were in manufacturing. Payroll wages from manufacturing have dropped from 49 percent to 9 percent since the mid-1980s.\\n“Life here is hard,” Samson says, pronouncing the word as hahd. “This area is so desperate for jobs, for anything, that [Coos residents] will do anything. You have nothing to do, so you are likely going to involve yourself in drugs and alcohol. This region has been decaying from within for quite a while. And hardly anyone notices.”\\nRick Samson, a Coos County commissioner, says economic distress has fueled drug use. (Photo: Courtesy of Rick Samson)\\nCoos County, one of the nation’s most consistent swing counties, once found hope in Barack Obama, the Democrat from Chicago who voters easily re-elected as president in 2012.\\nTheir hopes unfulfilled, a majority of Coos voters turned during the 2016 presidential election to another nontraditional politician promising change—billionaire developer and celebrity Donald Trump, running as a Republican.\\nTrump’s success in Coos County—he earned 52 percent of the vote, compared to Republican nominee Mitt Romney’s 40 percent in 2012—speaks to a little-discussed larger trend of the 2016 election involving rural parts of America and former manufacturing power centers.\\nA recent study by Penn State University showed Trump outperformed Romney most dramatically in counties where the drug, alcohol, and suicide mortality rate is among the nation’s highest. The mortality rate is defined as the number of drug-related, alcohol-related, and suicide deaths per 100,000 people.\\n\\nTrump also won 18 of the 25 states that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said had the most drug overdoses in 2015.\\nShannon M. Monnat, the Penn State study’s author and an assistant professor of rural sociology and demography, found that counties with high economic distress also have higher death rates related to substance abuse and voted strongly for Trump.\\n“Clearly there is an association between drug, alcohol, and suicide mortality and Trump’s election performance,” Monnat writes in her study, published in December, adding:\\nHowever, this relationship should not be interpreted as causal. No single factor can explain this election outcome. To suggest otherwise ignores the economic, social, and demographic complexities that drive human behavior and the contexts of the communities where these voters live. What these analyses demonstrate is that community-level well-being played an important role in the 2016 election, particularly in the parts of America far-removed from the world of urban elites, media, and foundations.\\n‘With You 1,000%’\\nTrump, like his general election opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton, often repeated a campaign pledge to curb opioid abuse.\\nAs the Republican nominee, Trump traveled to New Hampshire promising to combat the state’s opioid epidemic, which extends beyond Coos County.\\nThis series:\\nPart 1: The Crisis That May Have Swung Voters From Obama to Trump\\nPart 2: One Opioid Addict Helps Another Choose Life Over Death\\nPart 3: ‘Dr. Father Pill’ Wants to Be Part of the Solution\\nPart 4: Police Assault\\xa0on\\xa0Opioids Gets\\xa0Boost From a Family Doctor\\xa0\\nPart 5: The First Responders Who Witness a Dreadful Toll\\nIn 2015, more than 400 people in New Hampshire died as a result of drug overdoses, up from 326 such deaths in 2014 and 192 in 2013.\\nTrump, who finished first with 35 percent in the state’s crowded GOP primary field, said he would provide funding to local clinics to treat opioid abuse, and stop the flow of drugs coming into the state.\\n“I just want to let the people of New Hampshire know that I’m with you 1,000 percent, you really taught me a lot,” Trump said during a roundtable on the opioid crisis, where he met with residents affected by the drug epidemic and spoke of his own family’s history with addiction.\\nIn interviews with The Daily Signal, Coos County voters say Trump’s promise of beating the opioid epidemic doesn’t explicitly explain his electoral success here.\\n\\nRather, Trump’s “America first” economic promise of bringing back manufacturing jobs from overseas, and renegotiating trade deals, was tailor-made for Coos, which has an aging population that is 97 percent white.\\n“I think people think as a whole that Trump will bring back manufacturing and get people back to work,” says Steve Cass, the chief of police in Colebrook, a town in Coos with 2,300 residents.\\nCass says he usually votes Republican but doesn’t identify with a party.\\n“It was government that sold us down the river by basically allowing all these higher-paying production jobs to go overseas,” he says, “and maybe [residents] think it is government that can bring those jobs back.”\\nKarl Ruch, chairman of the Coos County Republican Committee, says few of his group’s 60 members—and other voters they interacted with—talked about response to the opioid crisis as a direct driver of their vote for president. But many, Ruch says, had personal encounters with addiction in some way.\\nRuch, 60, was born and raised in Lancaster, a town of 3,500 and the county seat, where he worked for 20 years in the emergency room of a hospital, sometimes treating drug overdoses.\\nKarl Ruch, chairman of the Coos County Republican Committee, says President Trump’s promise to bring manufacturing jobs back has revived hope in the community. (Photo: Courtesy of Karl Ruch)\\nHealth care and prisons (Berlin, Coos County’s only city, is home to both a state and federal prison) are the predominant industries today in the region.\\nThe county routinely is ranked last in the state for the quality of public health, measured by indicators such as length of life, diet and exercise, income, access to housing and transportation, and drug and alcohol use.\\nRuch says it’s intuitive that residents struggling through traumas—loss of a job or a home—could succumb to drugs and alcohol, and that solving those underlying problems could help curb their addictions.\\n“Trump’s message [gave] people the hope of bringing manufacturing jobs to the area again,” Ruch says, explaining:\\nWhen people thought about someone being able to re-energize manufacturing again, people also thought a lot of their other problems would be resolved. Trump may not have the exact answer, but there’s a ripple effect. If you have the economy growing, people after a long work day of logging or farming—true American jobs—want to go home and go to bed, and they don’t have time to get in trouble. They can have pride for themselves again, they can earn a paycheck and provide for their family.\\nIn the 2012 general election, Obama won 57.9 percent of the vote in Coos County. (He also won the county in 2008, although Clinton beat him there in the primary.)\\n“The majority of people in Coos County do not like government,” Emily Stone Jacobs, the 34-year-old chairwoman of the Coos County Democrats, tells The Daily Signal. “But there is a lot of need in Coos County, and the people here responded to Obama’s message of hope and change.”\\nIn addition to politics, Stone Jacobs works on the frontlines of the local opioid addiction crisis. She is a mental health counselor at Northern Human Services in Berlin, a nonprofit whose patients often have substance abuse issues.\\n\\nStone Jacobs attributes Trump’s success to\\xa0Clinton’s unpopularity among Coos County voters.\\n“Coos County did not like Hillary Clinton,” Stone Jacobs says. “Trump winning here had mostly to do with Clinton being the nominee. I don’t think our drug addiction crisis had any influence on Trump winning.”\\nShe notes that Trump did not set foot here during the campaign. The closest he came was a February 2016 stop in Plymouth, New Hampshire, a town in Grafton County bordering Coos to the south. Plymouth is about a two-hour drive from Colebrook.\\nBy contrast, during the Democrats’ primary campaign, Bernie Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont, traveled to the county for a town hall in Berlin. With his plain-spoken style, Sanders ran on an economic platform similar to Trump’s, Stone Jacobs notes, and promised to boost funding for mental health and opioid addiction treatment.\\nSanders earned 63 percent of the Coos County vote in the Democrat primary, beating eventual nominee Clinton by 28 points, the widest disparity of any county in the state. Sanders also earned a larger share of the total primary vote in Coos than Trump.\\nOnce a ‘Great Place’\\nCoos County used to be a political destination and a tourist draw, says Samson, the county commissioner.\\nOn a cold and dreary April morning, Samson is driving past what was once the Balsams Grand Resort and Hotel, an international hotel and ski destination that the federal government had listed on the National Register of Historic Places as worthy of preservation.\\nBut the 400-room Balsams resort, a fortresslike compound surrounded by mountains and built on 11,000 acres—including a championship golf course—closed almost six years ago.\\n\\nThe hotel has major political symbolism: Every four years, residents cast ballots here at midnight in the first presidential primary votes in the nation. Ronald Reagan and both George Bushes made pitches to voters at the hotel.\\nIn 2016, the first-in-the nation voting tradition continued, but in a hotel with no residents. Only Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a Republican presidential candidate, made it up here.\\nToday, the hotel’s various buildings stand intact, except for a dormitory for employees, which is partially—not all the way—torn down, as if frozen in time.\\nSamson, who has spent his entire life in Coos County besides a five-year stint in the Navy, recalls wistfully that his son and two daughters once worked at the 150-year-old hotel.\\nHis children served food, but often smelled rubber, Samson says. That’s because the original owners of the hotel, the Tillotson family, ran a rubber factory on adjacent property.\\nThe Tillotson Rubber Co., credited with creating the first latex balloons and gloves, shuttered in the 1980s, swallowed by overseas competition. An empty plot of melting snow marks its former existence.\\n“This is not the way this place always looked,” Samson says. “Balsams used to be known as ‘Switzerland of America.’ Between 1895 and 1905, Berlin was the largest paper-producing city in the world. It was a great place to raise a family.”\\nBalsams Grand Resort and Hotel closed almost six years ago, but still stands partially intact today.

But Berlin has seen its population decrease to about half the peak of more than 20,000 in the 1930s.\\n‘Getting the Boot Down’\\nCass, Colebrook’s police chief for the past 13 years, says local residents have learned not to expect much help from politicians.\\n“We don’t get the help from the outside and we don’t rely upon them, either,” says Cass, 48, whose matter-of-fact way masks his jolly demeanor.\\nCass, born and raised in Coos County, is taking it upon himself to spend a day on patrol.\\nColebrook Police Chief Steve Cass sometimes does patrols to supplement his nine-officer force. (Photo: Josh Siegel/The Daily Signal)\\nHis nine-officer police department (only five are full time) is housed inside Colebrook Town Hall, which also hosts the tax collector, town manager, and district court.\\nCass begins his shift driving his unmarked SUV through the Windsor Estates trailer park—an unfitting name for a cluster of mobile homes where residents are all low-income and white.\\nA “large percentage” of calls to the police in Colebrook come from the trailer park, Cass says, mostly related to domestic disturbances and opioid misuse.\\n“This right here is an example of what’s becoming Colebrook and Coos County,” Cass says of Windsor Estates. “This area has been getting nothing but getting the boot down, just getting stomped on. Jobs have not come back, nothing has regenerated, and what we get is politicians saying they know the plight of North Country, and Coos County, but nothing changes.”\\n\\nThe police department, Cass says, makes only a few arrests a week and a little more than 100 in a year. But in a small town like this, the impact of crime is closely felt, and its origins easy to trace.\\n“Most our crime is related to the use and sale of drugs,” Cass says. “The opioid problem for us started at the prescription level. Let’s face it. When it comes down to it, we put ourselves in the position we are in because of overprescribing. It’s coming from within.”\\n‘Part of the Problem, Part of the Solution’\\nCoos County’s opioid epidemic mirrors America’s. It started with doctors prescribing pain medication such as oxycodone or methadone for legitimate reasons.\\nFrom 1999 to 2013, the amount of opioids prescribed in the U.S. nearly quadrupled, the CDC says, and today about 2 million Americans are addicted to them.\\nOpioid pain relievers generally are safe when taken for a short time as prescribed by a doctor, but because they produce euphoria as well as pain relief, they can be misused. Prolonged use can increase the risk of addiction, overdose, and death.\\nIn Coos County, on-the-job injuries are common, and popular recreational activities—thrill rides through the mountains on ATVs and dirt bikes—can be dangerous.\\n“This is a playground up here,” says Laurie Connors, director of behavioral health services at Indian Stream Health Center, the largest health care provider in Coos. “The mentality ‘Live Free or Die’ [New Hampshire’s official motto] does explain a lot.”\\nCoos County, a place known for its outdoor recreation and natural beauty, borders Canada to the north, Vermont to the west, and Maine to the east. (Photo: Josh Siegel/The Daily Signal)\\nIndian Stream Health Center is one of 11 federally qualified health centers in New Hampshire, meaning it provides comprehensive services—primary care, dental, mental health—to an underserved area. This designation also means it qualifies for federal funding and enhanced reimbursement for Medicare and Medicaid.\\nBecause the center offers services for all kinds of care—to about 4,000 patients per year, regardless of ability to pay—Indian Stream doctors prescribe more medication than any other provider in the area.\\nJonathan Brown, Indian Stream’s CEO, acknowledges that his center was part of the problem, as doctors responded to demand for pain pills from low-income residents who couldn’t afford alternative services for pain, such as physical therapy.\\n“You’d have to go back decades when pain became a vital sign and the pharmaceutical industry began influencing prescriptions of these medications as the end-all be-all, and how delivering that medication impacted patient satisfaction surveys, which affects our reimbursement,” Brown says in an interview with The Daily Signal.\\n“A patient comes in with pain and the provider says, ‘I will give you five days [of medication], but then I need you to stretch and do your exercises and change your lifestyle.’ Patients aren’t doing that. They want the quick fix. They want the pill.”\\n\\nIn response to the trend of overprescribing, the state of New Hampshire in January implemented new protocols requiring medical professionals to conduct a risk assessment before prescribing opioids.\\nPatients also must sign an informed consent form, which allows doctors to access a database in the state’s prescription drug monitoring program to ensure the patient isn’t seeking drugs from multiple doctors. The form describes the risks of overdose and addiction, and requires the patient to submit to random pill counts to ensure he or she is taking the prescribed amount of medication.\\nIndian Stream is taking these regulations a step further, requiring patients who receive prescription pain medicine for 28 days or longer to participate in treatment at the facility, such as a substance abuse class or group therapy.\\n“We have the self-awareness to be honest with ourselves to say, ‘We have been a part of the problem, and we have to be a part of the solution,’” Brown says, adding:\\nAnd it’s wrong to say prescription opioids are bad. It’s more appropriate to say the misuse of those opioids are bad. Our responsibility is to educate, inform, and raise awareness for how to safely use prescription medication, how to keep our children safe, and how to teach our children to live healthy lifestyles. We are lucky enough to be in a position to do God’s work, and this organization provides a vehicle for us to do that. And we will.\\nA New Drug That’s ‘Killing People’\\nAs prescriptions have become more tightly regulated, and there is less supply of cheap opioid pain pills on the street, increasingly addictive drugs such as heroin and fentanyl have replaced them.\\nThese illicit drugs come from outside Coos County.\\nFentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid mostly used in medical settings to relieve pain related to cancer, is especially worrisome to local law enforcement officials. Fentanyl is often manufactured illegally for nonmedical use, and is frequently found as a street drug mixed with heroin.\\nAccording to the Drug Enforcement Administration, it usually originates from China and is sometimes trafficked directly into the U.S. or through Canada.\\nCarfentanil is one of fentanyl’s many analogs. It is typically used as a tranquilizer for large animals such as elephants, and it can kill people exposed to even tiny amounts.\\nAccording to the CDC, the fraction of drug overdose deaths across the nation involving synthetic drugs such as fentanyl rose from 8 percent in 2010 to 18 percent in 2015.\\nFrom 2014 to 2015, heroin overdose death rates in the U.S. increased by 21 percent, with nearly 13,000 dying in 2015.\\n“It’s easy to say the opioid crisis is a problem of legal prescription drugs,” Seth Leibsohn, co-director of Americans for Responsible Drug Policy, says in an interview with The Daily Signal.\\n“But most of the deaths of late are not happening that way,” adds Leibsohn, a former chief of staff to William Bennett, who served as “drug czar” under President George H.W. Bush. “Deaths from prescribed opioids are a problem, but the majority of deaths from those come from the diversion and illegal distribution of them.”\\nJohn McCormick, Coos County attorney, says the powerful synthetic opioid fentanyl has become the predominant killer in the community. (Photo: Josh Siegel/The Daily Signal)\\nJohn McCormick, the Coos County attorney and chief law enforcement officer, says that in 2015, five overdose deaths in the county resulted from the use of fentanyl. Last year, fentanyl killed three people here.\\n“Fentanyl is what’s killing people,” McCormick says quietly, sounding almost resigned to this fact in an interview with The Daily Signal in his office, where soft jazz plays in the background.\\n“The goal for overdose deaths in the county should be zero. We don’t want any people dying. Is it possible? I don’t know. In this climate, probably not right now.”\\n‘Got to Save Kids’\\nWith the opioid crisis here evolving, and already having victimized the working class, local leaders are turning to protect the next generation—or at least what’s left of it.\\nCass, the Colebrook police chief, says a recent graduating class of the high school in Pittsburg—the northernmost town in all of New Hampshire—had one student.\\nThe town, part of Coos County, has fewer than 1,000 residents.\\n“Imagine that—that boy is the salutatorian and valedictorian all in one,” Cass says facetiously.\\n“Most of our adolescents who graduate, they move on,” he adds, noting the example of his own three children, all of whom graduated from Coos County schools but plan to find work outside the region.\\nMain Street in Colebrook, a town in Coos County with 2,300 residents (Photo: Josh Siegel/The Daily Signal)\\nThe public school district in Berlin, serving 1,200 students in four schools, has taken especially aggressive action to guard against opioid abuse among the youth.\\nCorinne Cascadden, Berlin’s relentlessly upbeat superintendent of schools, says she currently knows of six to eight students who are active drug users.\\nIn 2013, almost 6 percent of Berlin High School students admitted trying heroin at least once, according to a CDC survey. The New Hampshire average for heroin use among high school students is 3 percent.\\nLast year, the Berlin school board made the anti-overdose drug Narcan available in the nurse’s office at all schools. The drug, a nasal spray that instantly can reverse an opioid overdose, has not had to be used on a student yet, Cascadden says.\\nThe school district is also in its third year of participating in Project AWARE (Advancing Wellness and Resilience in Education), a mental health program for students funded with federal grant money.\\nBob Thompson and Corinne Cascadden of Berlin Public Schools have taken aggressive action to guard against opioid abuse among the youth. (Photo: Josh Siegel/The Daily Signal)\\nThrough the program, teachers, principals, sports coaches, and others are taught how to recognize and respond to mental health issues. Those trained adult leaders can refer students to a mental health counselor inside the school if they meet certain risk factors, such as academic failure, aggressive behavior, and family problems at home.\\nAs of April, about 140 students were being served through the program, which is voluntary since parents may opt not to have their child participate.\\n“The upside and downside of being a small district is students are known, their behaviors outside of school are known, who they associate with are known, their families are known—often by our staff who have been born and raised in this community,” says Bob Thompson, the school district’s Office of Student Wellness coordinator.\\n“We are reading the names of the parents of these students in the local paper, or in the police report, for drug and alcohol use. They are growing up in that environment.”\\nThompson says he knows of some parents of high school students who use their children to sell drugs to feed their own habits.\\n\\nThe cycle of addiction is literally built inside some Coos County children from birth.\\nThe Androscoggin Valley Hospital, Berlin’s only hospital, reports that 10 percent of children born there are addicted to drugs.\\n“You can impact students one at a time,” Thompson says, adding:\\nThat’s not to say some of them aren’t already lost. Because we know some of them are. We will not be able to turn around all of those users. It’s important we try, because eventually these students are out in our community and they are either going to be assets or liabilities. We are going to have our police department chasing them around town, and they will be clogging our judicial system, and not being productive members of society, or they will be assets and productive members of society.\\nCascadden, a county native who is in her ninth year as superintendent, is invested in this community’s survival.\\nHer own children went through her schools when she was a principal in the district for 23 years.\\nShe is such a fixture that she says parents sometimes call her to come to students’ homes and get them out of bed and drive them to school.\\nOn these full-service missions, Cascadden has in certain instances seen signs of drug use in the home.\\nIt may seem out of place for a school superintendent to play parent and chauffeur, wandering into homes and taking charge, but then again, what if nobody else is there to solve the problem?\\n“There is lots of resiliency in this community,” Cascadden says. “You know, we are not afraid to say we have a problem. I mean, we have a drug problem. Why say everything is fine? It is not. But the other piece of that is, OK, what are we going to do about it? Because we are used to solving our own problems, and we are going to make it work because we’ve got to save kids.”\\nNext, in Part 2: In New Hampshire’s poorest county, one opioid addict helps another choose life over death.',\n",

I have had slip-ups,” she adds, her voice trailing off without completing the thought.\\nIndian Stream Health Center, the provider hosting the meeting—known formally as an intensive outpatient treatment program—is also the largest prescriber of pain medicine in Coos County, where the town of Colebrook is located.\\nThat means, at a time when Coos County, like America, is experiencing record numbers of deaths related to opioids—including prescription painkillers and heroin—Indian Stream Health Center is trying to resolve a problem it helped create.\\nNo one is more sensitive than John Fothergill to the conflict of providing medicine to people whose pain demands it, but whose bodies can’t tolerate overuse of it.\\nFothergill, an Indian Stream physician, is known by some Coos County residents as “Dr. Father Pill.”\\nDr. John Fothergill, a\\xa0physician who also is a New Hampshire state legislator, prescribed more of one opioid than any other doctor in the state. (Photo: Courtesy of John Fothergill)\\nThe derogatory play on the doctor’s name is a response to a story in the New Hampshire Union Leader finding that Fothergill, in 2013, was the top physician prescriber in the state of the opioid oxycodone hydrochloride, sold under brand names such as OxyContin.\\n“I have heard that some people say my name is Dr. Father Pill,” Fothergill, 62, tells The Daily Signal in an interview, revealing the nickname without a reporter asking about it. “We certainly prescribe this medicine, and some became addicted to it. I am quite sure I am part of the problem. I am not so naive to say I am not. Right now, I am trying to be more a solution than a part of the problem.”\\n‘They Blame Me’\\nWhen a reporter makes a late April visit to Coos County, New Hampshire’s poorest, several residents bring up Fothergill—by the nickname Father Pill—in describing how an opioid epidemic began here.\\nFothergill does not enjoy being the butt of jokes, his name connected to the most unfunny of designations: Coos County has the highest combined death rate due to drugs, alcohol, or suicide in all of New England.\\nThis statistic is felt intimately in a county that is New Hampshire’s largest by land mass—1,830 square miles—but smallest according to population. Coos’ 33,000 people represent less than 3 percent of the state.\\n\\nYet Fothergill doesn’t hide from his role in a complex problem, eager to provide context about how doctors like him fit into the multilayered supply chain of opioids.\\nFrom 1999 to 2013, the amount of opioids prescribed in the U.S. nearly quadrupled, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and about 2 million Americans today are addicted to them.\\nAccording to the Union Leader, Fothergill issued 1,066 prescriptions and refills of oxycodone HCL, or OxyContin, in 2013.\\nSince that story appeared, Fothergill has made himself more visible. He offered a rebuttal to the Union Leader, saying in a letter to the editor that the story drew an incomplete conclusion since it did not list the number of patients involved or the quantity of medication dispensed.\\nThe story also did not take into account the socioeconomic standing of a particular region, which Fothergill says is relevant because low-income residents are less likely to be able to afford alternative pain treatment such as physical therapy.\\n\\nFothergill not only is approaching his 30th year as a physician at Indian Stream, but he also recently became a New Hampshire state legislator. First elected to the state House of Representatives as a Republican in 2014, he has taken on a prominent role in pushing the medical industry to self-regulate as a member of the Health, Human Services and Elderly Affairs Committee.\\nThis series:\\nPart 1: The Crisis That May Have Swung Voters From Obama to Trump\\nPart 2: One Opioid Addict Helps Another Choose Life Over Death\\nPart 3: ‘Dr. Father Pill’ Wants to Be Part of the Solution\\nPart 4: Police Assault\\xa0on\\xa0Opioids Gets\\xa0Boost From a Family Doctor\\xa0\\nPart 5: The First Responders Who Witness a Dreadful Toll\\n“I got elected to the state Legislature without even campaigning,” Fothergill says. “So if you lined up every citizen in Colebrook and said, ‘Is Dr. Fothergill a plus or minus?’ the vast majority would say I am a plus in the community for all the work I have done over the years.”\\n“People are looking for someone to blame, and they blame me or the health center [Indian Stream] and there’s not much I can do about that. I sleep well at night.”\\n‘Blame to Go Around’\\nIndian Stream Health Center is one of 11 federally qualified health centers in New Hampshire, meaning it provides comprehensive services—primary care, dental, mental health—to an underserved area. This designation means it qualifies for federal funding and enhanced reimbursement under the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\\nBecause the center offers services for all kinds of care—to about 4,000 patients per year, regardless of their ability to pay—Indian Stream doctors prescribe more medication than any other provider in the area.\\nFothergill says strong demand exists in Coos County for pain medicine because many patients are low-income and uninsured, meaning their treatment options are limited.\\n“If somebody who walks into the office says, ‘I have back pain,’ there is a whole array of things one may do,” Fothergill says. “In Coos County, a lot of those things are not available to us, so probably more often than not, we prescribed pain medicine. Hopefully they would get better and come off of them.”\\n“Certainly,” he says of the opioid crisis, “the environment was sort of ripe for this to happen.”\\nIndian Stream Health Center is in Colebrook, above, a town in Coos County that has lost manufacturing jobs. (Photo: Josh Siegel/The Daily Signal)\\nFothergill is not alone in responding aggressively to that environment.\\nPete Moran, a physician in family practice at Indian Stream, ranked sixth in the Union Leader’s ranking of top opioid prescribers in 2013.\\nMoran says that in the 1990s, manufacturers of opioid painkillers marketed the drugs as an elixir to treat pain and downplayed potential harm.\\n“I have been in practice since the 1990s, when there was a period of time where the idea was that we weren’t adequately controlling pain,” Moran tells The Daily Signal in an interview. “There was a big campaign by the pharmaceuticals to prescribe their medicines.”\\nThe family practitioner says he was personally threatened by a patient for whom he refused to prescribe pain medicine.\\n“All of the opioids, if used at a high enough dose long enough, will create a dependence: a physical and chemical dependence,” Moran says, adding:\\nBut not everybody that is chemically dependent on an opioid is addicted. Someone who is addicted to a medicine is not just dependent on the medicine, but they also crave the medicine. It gives them a feeling of euphoria, and their life takes on a dimension where they are looking for the drug. You need to find the cause of that pain so you can treat it and fix it. Maybe as doctors we don’t do that well enough. I don’t know.\\n\\nCaleb Alexander, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Drug Safety and Effectiveness in Baltimore, says prescribers are one peg in a supply chain that has churned out opioids in historic numbers.\\nThe federal Food and Drug Administration has been criticized for too liberally approving painkillers pushed to market by drug manufacturers.\\nNumerous news reports, meanwhile, have documented how the Drug Enforcement Administration\\xa0has failed to hold accountable distributors and manufacturers that were creating and shipping millions of painkillers to be prescribed in communities across the U.S.\\nIn Congress, the House Energy and Commerce Committee recently opened an investigation into reports that the DEA reduced enforcement efforts against painkiller distributors during a lobbying campaign by the industry.\\n“There is plenty of blame to go around and many different parties have played an important role in propagating the opioid epidemic,” Alexander says in an interview with The Daily Signal. “But there’s a very clear correlation to the volume of opioids prescribed and injuries and deaths from these products. So high-volume prescribers are a very important part of the puzzle.”\\n‘Work Ourselves Out of a Job’\\nIn response to the trend of overprescribing, the state of New Hampshire in January implemented new protocols requiring medical professionals to conduct a risk assessment before prescribing opioids.\\nPatients also must sign an informed consent form, which allows doctors to access a database in the state’s prescription drug monitoring program to ensure the patient isn’t seeking drugs from multiple doctors.\\n\\nFothergill helped shape the legislation requiring these regulations from his perch on the health committee.\\n“The rules and regulations we came up with were a good compromise,” Fothergill says. “It makes physicians think about what they are doing. You are not just giving a prescription for 30 days and hoping for the best.”\\nFothergill also pushed for expansion of Medicaid in the state, which, under Obamacare, requires addiction services and mental health treatment to be included as part of the health care program for the poor.\\nIn Coos County last year, 5.4 percent of residents were covered under the program—more than in any other county in the nation.\\nIndian Stream is taking these new rules a step further, requiring patients who receive prescription pain medicine for 28 days or longer to participate in treatment at the facility, such as a substance abuse class or group therapy.\\nAs part of services such as the group therapy session attended by The Daily Signal, social workers employed by Indian Stream—the center has five of them—inform patients about the drivers of their addiction.\\n\\nThese social workers try to help patients resolve related life “traumas” that may make them susceptible to addiction.\\nCoos County is routinely ranked\\xa0last in the state for quality of public health, measured by indicators such as length of life, diet and exercise, income, access to housing and transportation, and drug and alcohol use.\\n“The risk of addiction increases based on how much trauma you have experienced,” Laurie Connors, Indian Stream’s director of Behavioral Health Services, says in an interview with The Daily Signal. Connors adds:\\nSubstance abuse is a coping mechanism for pain. You are continuously feeding this cycle and never getting at the root cause of the issue unless you address the social determinants of health—unemployment, domestic violence, poverty.\\nIndian Stream also offers medication-assisted treatment, a fast-growing response to addiction in which doctors prescribe nonaddictive painkillers that can be used to counteract the effects of opioids.\\nSeth Leibsohn, co-director of Americans for Responsible Drug Policy, argues that treatment alone won’t stop the opioid addiction epidemic.\\n“Most of the efforts dealing with the opioid crisis are geared toward recovery, which is important and not to be ignored, but no one is doing prevention,” Leibsohn says in an interview with The Daily Signal. “You want to save all the lives you can. Recovery is really hard. You want to do everything you can, but how about stopping the problem before it starts?”\\nLeibsohn, a former chief of staff to William Bennett, the nation’s “drug czar” under President George H.W. Bush, says the best way to prevent drug misuse is to educate people about its dangers. He contends that a strong public relations campaign can overcome other factors that may influence drug misuse.\\n“I have heard often enough from people that opioid addiction is a disease of despair,” Leibsohn says, adding:\\nWhile I get that, I don’t want to fall into the trap where we think economics drive substance abuse. I do think people try to anesthetize themselves from problems. But the main driver is not economic. We have given up on the message that drugs are dangerous. There is a cultural message that has destigmatized the problem of drug use that has been going on for close to two decades.\\nLaurie Connors, left, director of behavioral health services at Indian Stream Health Center, says life “traumas” may make people susceptible to addiction. (Photo: Courtesy of Laurie Connors)\\nBack in Coos County, Jonathan Brown, Indian Stream’s CEO, says his health care center has a “responsibility” to provide treatment services and better manage its prescription procedures.\\nBrown, who started work at Indian Stream 13 years ago in an information technology job—giving him a pragmatic perspective—says treating the causes of pain will improve the wellbeing of the community, even if his bottom line suffers because of it.\\n“A part of our greater responsibility is to help change people’s beliefs about the stigma of mental health and substance abuse, to overcome a culture of hopelessness that has been fostered in Coos County,” Brown tells The Daily Signal in an interview. “Every day our job is to work ourselves out of a job.”\\n‘Not Going Anywhere’\\nDespite his efforts to make amends, Fothergill knows the whispers about him won’t go away.\\nThe physician acknowledges that Coos County remains in a drug crisis, and says he regrets not pushing back harder on patients who sought pain medicine but could have been treated first with less risky alternatives.\\nFothergill says he plans to retire soon, and vows to spend the rest of his life in Coos County.\\n“I am not going anywhere,” Fothergill says, adding:\\nI certainly feel very bad for anyone who may have become addicted because of the medication I started them on, and we don’t want to be creating any more addicts. Aside from the opioid stuff, I actually think I do a pretty good job.

(Photo: Joshua Roberts/Reuters\\n/Newscom)\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump did not violate the law when he reportedly revealed classified information about an Islamic State terrorist plot during a meeting last week with Russian officials, intelligence and legal experts say.\\nBut the news that Trump shared intelligence with the Russians that was provided to the U.S. by a partner country in the Middle East—a nation that had not given the Americans permission to share the information with Russia—raised questions about the legal issues and protocols that surround disclosures of classified information.\\n>>> In New Russia Stir, White House and Allies Call Leaks to Media Real Problem\\nThe New York Times reported Tuesday that Israel provided the intelligence in question, potentially complicating the U.S. relationship with its important Middle East ally.\\nH.R. McMaster, Trump’s national security adviser, would not confirm or deny if Trump shared classified information with the Russian foreign minister and ambassador during a meeting at the White House last week. He downplayed the seriousness of the information Trump disclosed, saying that Trump in the moment made the decision to reveal the intelligence to the Russians.\\n“What the president discussed with the foreign minister was wholly appropriate to that conversation and is consistent with the routine sharing of information between the president and any leaders with whom he’s engaged,” McMaster said at a White House briefing.\\nBelow, The Daily Signal answers basic questions about how the U.S. obtains intelligence, what the process is for classifying and declassifying it, and what the consequences could be of breaking with protocol.\\n1.) Did Trump Have Legal Authority to Disclose the Information?\\nLegal, national security, and intelligence experts agree the president can declassify or disclose whatever information he wants as part of his constitutional powers as commander in chief.\\n“The president is his own declassifying authority,” said David Shedd, an acting director of the Defense Intelligence Agency under President Barack Obama who also served in the George W. Bush administration’s National Security Council.\\n“He doesn’t have to ask anybody else whether he can declassify anything,” said Shedd, who is now a visiting fellow at The Heritage Foundation, in an interview with The Daily Signal. “As a declassifying officer in his standing as president of the U.S. and commander in chief, no one else has that authority to divulge the information spontaneously—not to mention with information that wasn’t ours to begin with.”\\nPatrick Eddington, a policy analyst in homeland security and civil liberties at the Cato Institute and a former CIA analyst, agreed that Trump’s legal authority should not be questioned, although he said it’s fair to assess the president’s judgment.\\nEddington told The Daily Signal:\\nWhat makes the whole office of the president different is that the rules just don’t apply. The only relevant questions are, did Trump break trust with a foreign power who supplied this information by not clearing it with them in advance, which would be bad form but not unprecedented. And two, in doing so, did he potentially compromise a genuine, perishable source?\\nEven if the president has unique authority, other people can be charged with crimes for revealing classified information.\\nExperts say a government official could be prosecuted under the Espionage Act of 1917, which prohibits the improper accessing, handling, or transmitting of “information respecting the national defense” with the intent of injuring the U.S. or aiding a foreign nation.\\n“Under the Espionage Act that person can be charged and probably would be unless the president authorized the disclosure,” said Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the Brennan Center for Justice’s liberty and national security program, in an interview with The Daily Signal.\\nGovernment officials who reveal classified information in an unauthorized fashion could also lose their security clearance and job, Goitein said.\\n2.) What Information Did Trump Disclose, and Was It Appropriate to Do So?\\nThe White House has said Trump did not divulge the source and method of the intelligence he shared with the Russians. The Washington Post reported the information Trump gave to the Russians had to do with an ISIS terrorist threat related to the use of bombs embedded in laptop computers on airplanes.\\nThe U.S. government has already publicly disclosed the laptop threat and acted in response to it.\\nIn March, the U.S. and Britain barred passengers traveling through airports in 10 Muslim-majority countries from carrying laptop computers, tablets, and other devices larger than cellphones aboard direct inbound flights. The Department of Homeland Security is also reportedly considering extending the ban to flights from Europe to the U.S.\\nH.R. McMaster, President Trump’s national security adviser, said during the White House briefing Tuesday that the president’s conversation with Russian officials was “wholly appropriate.” (Photo: Joshua Roberts/Reuters/Newscom)\\nShedd said even if the broad contours of the laptop threat are publicly known, the president should be careful in revealing details related to it.\\n“Don’t confuse acting responsibly with authority,” Shedd said. “[Trump] has a responsibility like any president does to determine whether the information he wishes to release will have negative implications or a fallout. If you have a particular threat that pinpoints not just the fact of a laptop threat or something the [Transportation Security Administration] has already revealed, but add to it by saying [the threat] is out of this airport and this country, and this kind of airline, that starts to reveal the sourcing, or the method, or both. And that has consequences with how partners may share information in the future.”\\n3.) How Are the Rules for Declassifications and Disclosures Set?\\nThe rules of classification are governed by an executive order—not by congressional statute—that is periodically updated by different presidents. The current version is Executive Order 13526, which\\xa0Obama signed in 2009. Trump has not modified it yet.\\nUnder the order, “original classification authorities,” such as the leaders of U.S. departments and agencies, can classify and declassify information “owned”—collected or received—by their organizations.\\nThose authorities can then permit the disclosure of the information to someone who has the proper security clearance and has a status that says they to “need to know” it. Because the president oversees all the agencies, he has full rights to these powers on his own.\\nGoitein said Obama’s executive order includes a section saying that when the U.S. obtains intelligence from a foreign partner, the American government should honor the restrictions the allied country puts on sharing the information.\\n“It also says in the executive order that an unauthorized disclosure of a foreign government’s intelligence is presumed to cause harm to [that country’s] national security,” Goitein said.\\n4.) How Does the US Rely on Other Countries for Intelligence?\\nJohn Hannah, senior counselor at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said intelligence cooperation with allied countries—known as “liaison relationships”—are essential to U.S. national security.\\n“These relationships are some of the crown jewels of the intelligence business,” said Hannah, who was Vice President Dick Cheney’s deputy national security adviser for the Middle East in the first term of the George W. Bush administration.\\n“We can’t do this alone,” Hannah told The Daily Signal in an interview. “We have huge amounts of capabilities, but particularly in some difficult target sets, there will be players who have unique advantages that are very important to us, particularly in terrorism cases, where it can be very hard to get inside information on the plotting of an operation.”\\nHannah called Israel—the reported source of the information that Trump shared with Russia—the U.S.’ most important intelligence partner in the Middle East, with one of the “top five or six most capable” intelligence gathering operations in the world.\\nRon Dermer, the Israeli ambassador to the United States, told The New York Times that the two countries would maintain a close counterterrorism relationship despite Trump’s disclosure to Russia.\\n“Israel has full confidence in our intelligence-sharing relationship with the United States and looks forward to deepening that relationship in the years ahead under President Trump,” Dermer said.\\nHannah too maintained confidence in U.S.-partner relationships.\\n“If in fact an unauthorized compromise occurred, partners will be disappointed and could become more cautious in what they share,” Hannah said. “But at the end of the day, we are leaps and bounds the most capable intelligence service in the world, and the value-added we provide is tremendous. So the thought that this one incident—particularly if sources and methods were not compromised—would lead a country to rupture or fundamentally reassess its intelligence relationship with the U.S., I seriously doubt it. Our partners benefit too much from the reciprocal cooperation.”',\n",
       " 'Army Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr., the top American commander in Afghanistan, greets U.S. and Afghan forces on April 29, 2017. (Photo: Staff/Reuters/Newscom)\\nIn an early test of his foreign policy, President Donald Trump is facing a decision on whether to contribute thousands of additional U.S. troops to America’s longest-running—and often overlooked—war.\\nAs first reported by The Washington Post, Trump’s senior military and foreign policy advisers recommend that the president send 3,000 to 5,000 more troops to bolster an existing U.S. force of 8,400 in Afghanistan and help that country’s government gain momentum in a 15-year war against the Taliban, the Islamist insurgent group.\\nExperts who study the Afghanistan War say the plan is designed to break a stalemate in the fighting, and to pressure the resurgent Taliban to negotiate a peace agreement with the Afghan government.\\nThese experts, in interviews with The Daily Signal, say the proposed strategy does not represent a dramatic U.S. escalation to a war in which America once committed 100,000 troops.\\nBut they say if Trump were to approve the plan—he’s expected to make a decision before a May 25 NATO meeting in Brussels—it would challenge the president’s evolving foreign policy doctrine. That doctrine has trended toward a narrow counterterrorism-first approach rather than deep commitments to overseas conflicts.\\n“My best guess is [Trump’s advisers] are looking to at least stop the bleeding in Afghanistan at the moment,” Bill Roggio, who edits the Foundation for Defense of Democracies’ Long War Journal, said in an interview with The Daily Signal. “They are also doing what they think they can get away with and what is politically acceptable. There is not a lot of support in the American public, and among members of Congress, for a significantly deeper U.S. commitment to the Afghanistan War.”\\nRoggio said he did not think the additional troops would fundamentally change the situation in Afghanistan, where more than 2,000 U.S. troops have died and another 20,000 have been wounded.\\n“The Taliban have had momentum for several years now,” Roggio said. “They have weathered a full surge of U.S. forces. The Afghan security forces have not been able to hold the gains. So I don’t think an incremental increase in troops will affect the situation all that much.”\\n‘Rise From the Dead’\\nYet Roggio and others say an extra U.S. presence could reverse declines in the security situation in Afghanistan.\\nPresident Barack Obama, who had pledged to end U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan, steadily reduced the American role, but did not completely pull out troops due to a number of security challenges.\\nThe Taliban is gaining territory. Reuters reports the Islamist group controls 40 percent of the country, and that casualties for government forces reached record levels last year. In addition, the terrorist group al-Qaeda has established new footholds in Afghanistan, the country it used to plan the 9/11 attacks. And ISIS also has established a small presence in Afghanistan.\\n“Afghanistan is not the only place, and even the most important place at any given time [for U.S. interests],” Michael O’Hanlon, director of the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution, said in an interview with The Daily Signal. “But as we have seen with the Taliban surge, and ISIS gaining a foothold there, it’s pretty clear this area has an ability to allow bad guys to rise from the dead. You want a sustained presence in Southeast Asia as the easternmost pillar in the counterterrorism capacity of the United States.”\\n‘Not a Surge’\\nCurrently, American forces in Afghanistan have two primary missions: advising and training Afghan forces and conducting counterterrorism missions, including a recent raid that killed the leader of ISIS’ affiliate there, Abdul Hasib.\\nAccording to The New York Times, the new Trump administration plan would allow American advisers to assist a larger number of Afghan forces, and work closer to the front lines. Under the proposal, the U.S. would also not set a firm deadline for withdrawing troops, as Obama did.\\nDefense Secretary James Mattis, center right, is greeted by presidential palace staff as he arrives to meet with Afghanistan’s President Ashraf Ghani in April. (Photo: Jonathan Ernst/Pool/Zuma Press/Newscom)\\n“This is not a surge,” said James Jay Carafano, vice president for foreign and defense policy at The Heritage Foundation, who advised Trump’s transition team. “This is still going to be an Afghan-led thing.”\\nCarafano, a retired Army officer, added:\\nIt’s not a dramatic expansion of the conflict where we go in there and say we will win once and for all. It’s about how we get to conditions on the ground that keep Afghanistan on a path to stability. That’s what’s driving the troop numbers.\\nOthers say the Trump administration risks being stuck in a middle-ground position, with little realistic chance for new peace talks unless both sides make concessions.\\nThe challenges for peace are exacerbated at a time when Afghanistan’s security leadership faces allegations of corruption, and the Taliban has shown little inclination to make concessions.\\nThe Taliban also has been buffered by support from Iran and Russia, while Afghanistan’s neighbor, Pakistan, continues to provide a safe haven for militant groups.\\nTestifying before Congress in February, Army Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr., the top American commander in Afghanistan, called for a “holistic review” of policy toward and financial aid for Pakistan.\\n“It’s always been a close call on its merits, on whether it’s worth waging war in Afghanistan or not,” Stephen Biddle, a senior fellow for defense policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, said in an interview with The Daily Signal, adding:\\nYou can still make a reasonable case for it and against it. I don’t think this is a hopeless situation. It’s not crazy to suppose we can get a compromise settlement. But that requires we get serious about this, which includes the Trump administration owning this process and expending political capital to build a constituency to support it.\\nGuarding Against ‘Catastrophic Events’\\nRebecca Zimmerman, a policy researcher at RAND Corporation who focuses on Afghanistan, sought to downplay expectations for what an enhanced U.S. presence in the country could do.\\nShe says U.S. support is most needed to prevent collapse of the Afghan government, which would make the country an ungoverned space to be exploited by extremist groups.\\n“The biggest threat to the U.S. is government collapse in Afghanistan,” Zimmerman told The Daily Signal. “If that happens, there is a likelihood of a multiparty civil war, and the countryside will be open to anyone who wants to plant a terrorist flag there. If we can support the Afghan forces to guard against catastrophic events that can fell the government, we would be using those troops effectively.”\\nWith no near-term endgame, Roggio of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies says it’s fair to question whether the U.S. should continue to supply troops and funding — about $23 billion annually — to the Afghanistan War.\\nBut he says walking away from Afghanistan would present immeasurable costs.\\n“It’s never wrong to question why we are still at war 15 years later,” Roggio said. “We should be asking hard questions about why we are sending service members to die. But it would be massive victory for jihadist groups across the world if the U.S. decided to pull out of Afghanistan.”',\n",
       " 'Ed McMurray, a production manager at NLMK USA, observes the process of hot-rolling steel slabs into a thinner, more usable form  at the steel mill in Farrell, Pennsylvania. (Photo: Josh Siegel/The Daily Signal)\\nFARRELL, Pa.– Halfway between Cleveland and Pittsburgh, in a piece of middle America collectively known as Shenango Valley, stands a steel mill that dates back to the late 1800s.\\nEd McMurray, 44, has spent nine years at the mill, NLMK USA, where he says he has worked “here, there, and everywhere,” spanning various components of steelmaking.\\n“Somebody has to do it,” says McMurray, covered head to toe in a hardhat, protective jacket, and workboots as he walks through the scalding hot rolling section of the mill, where flashes of fire transform massive slabs of steel into a thinner, more usable form.\\nThe steelmaking operation during McMurray’s time at NLMK does not look like it used to.\\nAlmost two decades ago, as the American steel industry evolved through competition, innovation, and technology, NLMK emerged from bankruptcies and ownership changes to alter its business model. The company outsourced to other countries the early part of the production process — the melting of raw materials such as iron ore into steel slabs.\\nNLMK’s unique business model has been mostly successful, and lucrative to McMurray — most employees here make six figures with benefits.\\n“The company has taken care of me,” says McMurray, as he reflects during a drive through a dirt yard near a railroad track, where 40,000 pound slabs of steel lie and wait to be transformed into steel coils for customers.\\n“I have given the company a good effort,” McMurray, a veteran of the Army and college graduate, tells The Daily Signal. “I have done what they ask me to do, plus whatever else.”\\nNLMK’s Pennsylvania location employs 560 workers and rolls 150,000 tons of steel slab per month. (Photo: Josh Siegel/The Daily Signal)\\nBut NLMK has seen its bottom line suffer recently as a result of “Buy America” rules written into U.S. law that define what “made in America” means and prevent certain steel producers from participating in government-funded work.\\nThrough a recent executive order, President Donald Trump has offered strong support for the Buy America policy, signaling his intent to strictly enforce the already-existing rules and apply it to his proposed $1 trillion infrastructure plan.\\nIn anticipation of that executive order, signed April 18, steel mills such as NLMK that depend on imported steel — known in industry terms as “re-rollers” — increased their government lobbying efforts, worried that Trump could impose a more restrictive “Buy America” standard to other categories of government spending.\\nIf this were to happen, to compete for lucrative government work NLMK would have to buy more expensive steel slabs domestically, and the supply isn’t readily available, company executives say.\\nMcMurray, who was laid off for 13 weeks in 2009 when business was particularly bad, warns of the potential consequences.\\n“If the policies continue to where we can’t import the slabs, you won’t have layoffs,” he says. “You will have worse.”\\nThe Trump administration declined The Daily Signal’s\\xa0request for\\xa0comment for this report.\\n‘Different Than Competitors’\\nHistorically, most U.S. steel mills — including NLMK — were so-called integrated mills that combine and melt raw materials to produce their own slabs of steel.\\nNLMK, like other manufacturers, found it not cost effective to fabricate the steel on site — which requires maintaining a multimillion-dollar furnace to melt the steel.\\nSo 18 years ago, NLMK began importing semi-finished steel slabs from other countries such as Russia and Brazil that have rich deposits of iron ore and coal, the raw materials that become steel. NLMK’s parent company is based in Russia (the acronym stands for Novolipetsk Steel).\\n“People who aren’t educated about the evolution of the steel industry don’t understand the jobs that went away, and this model that we and others adopted that put jobs back to work, and sustained jobs,” Bob Miller, NLMK’s sharply dressed president and CEO, tells The Daily Signal.\\nUnder NLMK’s production model, the process starts at the railroad tracks on the mill property, where five trains per week arrive from the Port of Philadelphia carrying slabs of semi-finished steel that were produced overseas and delivered by boat.\\nA forklift-like slab hauler transports the steel into NLMK’s hot rolling mill. The process looks like a fire-powered, more explosive version of the rolling of dough.\\nThe heat flattens the steel slab, reducing its thickness. The steel then moves to a pickling line, where an acid solution rinses the steel to remove stains and rust.\\nNext is a finishing unit, called a cold mill, which stretches and thins the steel some more.\\nMiller, 51, says the mill rolls 150,000 tons of steel slab per month.\\n“We’ve been successful,” Miller says. “Our whole business model is to be different than all of our competitors. So we outservice them. We outproduce them. We are nimble. We don’t have the layers, so customers can call and pick up the phone and talk to me.”\\nEd McMurray, a production manager at NLMK, showcases the finished steel product, known as coil. (Photo: Josh Siegel/The Daily Signal)\\nDefining ‘Made in America’\\nAll of this work, as defined by law, does not qualify as being made in America.\\nThe Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 placed domestic content requirements on federal grants that go to states and localities, mandating that various materials, such as steel, used for infrastructure projects must be “produced in the United States.”\\nIndividual agencies within the Department of Transportation, such as the Federal Highway Administration, interpret the meaning of “produced in the United States” differently, but many agencies say steel must be “melted and poured” in America to qualify.\\nUnder this definition, NLMK’s steel would not qualify because the mill does not have its own furnace to melt the steel, but instead imports already-melted slabs from overseas.\\nThat means NLMK’s steel cannot be used in certain state and local infrastructure projects that are funded with federal grant money.\\nWhile government-funded work makes up less than 5 percent of the company’s business, Miller says the reverberations of the “melted and poured” standard have a deeper impact.\\nNLMK sells much of its steel to service centers — which are wholesalers — that then distribute the steel to end users.\\nThese service centers can’t always predict what inventory will be used for projects funded with federal grants.\\nBob Miller, president and chief executive officer of NLMK USA, says that despite threats to his import-reliant steel mill, “with all we built here, we’ll manage to survive.” (Photo: Josh Siegel/The Daily Signal)\\nJim Banker, NLMK’s executive vice president, says some customers are holding back on purchasing steel from his mill because they fear the government later could rule the steel doesn’t meet the American-made definition.\\n“We have customers proactively coming to us and saying we are getting nervous about buying from you,” Banker says. “Our customers’ customers are saying we need steel melted and poured in the U.S. That’s the threat we are getting. This is very real for us right now.”\\nIn his April executive order, Trump affirms that the U.S. will promote steel “melted and poured” in America.\\n“Produced in the United States means, for iron and steel products, that all manufacturing processes, from the initial melting stage through the application of coatings, occurred in the United States,” the order reads.\\nIn his first days in office, Trump also issued a memo calling for the “melted and poured” standard to be mandated for iron or steel products used in construction of U.S. oil pipelines.\\nBy drawing explicit attention to the “melted and poured” standard, Miller and Banker fear, Trump will make these “Buy America” requirements more far-reaching, expanding their application into additional types of government-funded work.\\nThe mill executives worry that by Trump’s bringing public attention to a little-known aspect of federal law, potential customers could be discouraged to buy from import-reliant manufacturers such as NLMK even when the rules don’t apply.\\n“How about the guy who is a patriot, and he happens to turn on Fox News and these executive orders are coming out and it’s the first time he is really hearing about ‘melted and poured,’” Miller says, adding:\\nHe is a guy that buys our steel, but just kind feels like, ‘You know, we are going to do the right thing, we are going to make the country great again.’ And so he makes his own decision to lend his hand of support to [Trump], and he decides he won’t buy steel from us anymore because we can’t satisfy ‘melted and poured.’ That’s the collateral damage part of this.\\nStricter Enforcement\\nWhile the “melted and poured” rules existed for decades before he became president, Trump says he intends to clamp down on loopholes that allow contractors to bypass the requirement.\\nFor example, for projects funded by the Federal Highway Administration, contractors can ignore the made-in-America requirement in cases where complying increases the cost of the project by more than 25 percent.\\nThe cold mill at NLMK stretches a steel product into a thin, smooth form. (Photo: Josh Siegel/The Daily Signal)\\nThere are other exemptions.\\nA 1979 law that codifies various U.S. trade deals, known as the Trade Agreements Act, gives the president the authority to waive domestic content requirements for products sourced from countries that have free trade agreements with America.\\nTrump’s executive order refers to the historic use of waivers like these as overly “judicious,” and calls for closer scrutiny in how they are applied to ensure “maximum utilization of goods, products, and materials produced in the United States.”\\nThe order also calls for the Commerce Department and the U.S. trade representative to assess how America’s free trade agreements affect application of domestic content requirements.\\n‘Enforce Existing Law’\\nSteel industry and government contract experts say that all together, Trump’s actions so far amount to little substantive change in American policy.\\n“The April executive order doesn’t change any law,” Sandy Hoe, a government contracts attorney at Covington & Burling in Washington, D.C., says in an interview with The Daily Signal, explaining:\\nIt is a lot like a lot of [Trump’s] executive orders in that it directs a study. It asks the secretary of commerce [Wilbur Ross] to explain what the department is doing to enforce existing law, so it puts the issue at a higher priority level.\\nSupporters of strong enforcement of domestic content requirements argue that these rules promote economic growth and create jobs in the U.S. steel industry.\\nThe U.S. steel industry is relatively small. It employs about 140,000 people, or less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the American workforce.\\nMajor American manufacturers in the industry, such as U.S. Steel, have lobbied for more restrictive Buy America provisions, arguing that American companies and workers should benefit from taxpayer-funded infrastructure projects such as those Trump says he intends to pursue.\\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order in April calling for strong enforcement of “made in America” rules that he says promote economic growth. (Photo: Shealah Craighead/ZumaPress/Newscom)\\nU.S. Steel, the largest steel company in the country, operates as an integrated mill, meaning it produces its steel from start to finish in the U.S. using an on-site melting furnace.\\nSo unlike NLMK, U.S. Steel satisfies “melted and poured” requirements.\\n“U.S. Steel finds President Trump’s executive action to be an encouraging development for American manufacturing,” Meghan Cox, the company’s manager of external communications, says in a statement to The Daily Signal. “Our company is proud to produce steel from start to finish in facilities across America. A strong domestic steel industry is at the foundation of America’s economic and national security.”\\nKevin Dempsey, senior vice president of policy at the American Iron and Steel Institute, contends that strong Buy America rules encourage further production in the U.S. In an interview with The Daily Signal, Dempsey says steel manufacturers that produce their entire product here should get unique treatment because they take on greater costs.\\nDempsey interprets Trump’s executive order as a status quo commitment to keep the Buy America rules as they are.\\n“The vast majority of expense and investment and fine tuning required to make steel is in the initial melting processes, where you are are creating the initial raw steel,” Dempsey says, adding:\\nWhat Trump is doing is coming out firmly in support of the majority of the steel industry that wants to keep the law as it’s been. There are companies like NLMK that are actively seeking to get a change in how Buy America rules apply to make their imported-slab product qualify. Our concern is if you treat a product that is partially made elsewhere as made in America, you are disincentivizing further steel investment in the U.S.\\n‘Made in the USA’\\nBut some industry experts argue that made-in-America requirements distort the marketplace, disrupt supply chains, and elevate certain manufacturers over others simply because of the business model they choose to use.\\nDan Ikenson, director of the trade policy center at the libertarian Cato Institute, says imposing more restrictive Buy America provisions could force customers to stop buying from companies such as NLMK, and choose higher-priced alternatives. That could increase the costs of infrastructure projects.\\n“If you don’t care about reading the fine print and just read the slogan, made-in-America provisions sound pretty darn patriotic,” Ikenson says, adding:\\nBut the fact is, if you put a premium on this idea of starting and building everything from scratch in the U.S., there is a lot of collateral damage. What it ends up doing is prescribing what your supply chain should be — to do it in a less efficient manner. Economically, the most efficient way to run your business may be option A, but A will disqualify you, so you go to option B, which is inefficient.\\nMiller, of NLMK, says changing his business model is not feasible. Buying steel slabs domestically would be costly, because of the limited supply here, he says.\\nAnd he predicts “there will never be another blast furnace built in the U.S.” because of the expense, so his mill won’t be melting its own steel anytime soon.\\nAs he describes the different components of his on-site steel operation — offloading steel slabs off rail cars, managing the slab yard, heating and cooling slabs into finished coil — he reminds a visitor that each step depends on the same thing: American workers.\\n“We are made in the U.S.A.,” Miller says. “With all we built here, we’ll manage to survive.”',\n",
       " 'Coos County, New Hampshire, has the highest combined death rate due to drugs, alcohol, or suicide in all of New England. (Photo: Bastiaan Slabbers\\n/NurPhoto/Sipa/Newscom)\\n\\n\\nCOLEBROOK, N.H.—Sally Zankowski is who comes when it’s too late. She’s there to define, investigate—and make sense of—another sudden death owed to opioid overdose in New Hampshire’s poorest and most remote county.\\nZankowski, 55, is the medical examiner for Coos County, which has the highest combined death rate due to drugs, alcohol, or suicide in all of New England.\\nOf the death she encounters in the vast, sparsely populated region she covers, the cause is usually easy to determine.\\n\\nPart 5 of 5: The First Responders Who Witness a Dreadful Toll\\nAn elderly person has died from natural causes, while asleep in bed. A sick, deteriorating person has lost his battle with cancer, a day that both he and his family knew was coming. Autopsies are unnecessary.\\n“More often than not, we can say these are expected deaths,” Zankowski tells The Daily Signal. “You write a one-page paper, follow up with funeral home, hospital, and family. You sign a death certificate, and off we go.”\\n“What gets a medical examiner really involved is an accidental or unexpected death,” adds Zankowski, who is officially known as the assistant deputy medical examiner for Coos County and parts of neighboring Grafton County.\\nLately, Zankowski has been investing herself in these kind of deaths—out-of-the-blue, hard-to-figure overdoses related to opioids, whether prescribed painkillers, heroin, fentanyl, or a mixture of some or all.\\nIndiscriminate and persistent, these deaths puzzle, frustrate, sadden, anger, and overwhelm.\\n“One of the things we have heard over the years is the epidemic with opioid drugs crosses all boundaries—socioeconomic, age, sex, race, it doesn’t matter—and that has been slammed in my face,” Zankowski says. “I can’t figure it out.”\\n‘End of the World’\\nAs Coos County, like America, grapples with an epidemic of opioid addiction and seeks solutions to slow its fury, Zankowski drives for answers in preventing the ultimate consequence of this drug crisis: death.\\nFor suspected fatal overdoses, Zankowski, a longtime Coos County resident in her fifth year as medical examiner here, must decide if an autopsy should be done to determine for certain a death’s cause and manner.\\n\\nShe makes this decision in conjunction with physicians from the state’s Office of the Chief Medical Examiner and Coos County Attorney John McCormick. Next of kin may request an autopsy, but officials may authorize the procedure without the family’s permission.\\nAutopsies, conducted by specialized doctors known as pathologists, are surgical procedures that consist of making external examinations, removing and dissecting organs, and collecting samples for tests.\\nThe National Association of Medical Examiners recommends autopsies for all overdoses.\\nZankowski says that in Coos County, most suspected drug-related deaths result in autopsies because the cases could involve criminal activity and the results are helpful for prosecution.\\nThe autopsies usually confirm what Zankowski’s trained eyes can see.\\nIn the 10 years prior to her becoming medical examiner, Zankowski was an emergency room nurse at Upper Connecticut Valley Hospital in Colebrook, a town of 2,300 in Coos County.\\nOn any given day, she says, at least some of the hospital’s 10 or fewer beds were occupied by drug users.\\n\\nNew Hampshire’s medical examiners don’t have to be physicians. So Zankowski thought her familiarity with drug-related trauma in the emergency room—which didn’t always lead to death—prepared her well for the real thing:\\nMy entire life, I remember statistics and people related to drug addiction because the population here is so small. Up here, you are at the end of the world. When they die, I rarely encounter someone who I at least don’t recognize by family name. Yet still, I am surprised time after time—for the young, middle-aged, whatever—that drugs are involved with the death.\\n‘Prepare for What I Will See’\\nFor Zankowski, surprise really means “it’s hard to believe this keeps happening.”\\nBecause the drug-related scenes are beginning to look similar, with the same unsatisfying ending.\\nZankowski’s job starts when she gets a call from the police—local or state, and many towns in Coos don’t have police departments—who alert her to a death.\\nSometimes Zankowski is far away from the scene. It can take her an hour and a half to drive through her coverage area.\\nCoos is the largest county in New Hampshire by land area, 1,830 square miles—containing numerous tiny towns spread far apart—and the smallest by population. Its 33,000 residents represent less than 3 percent of the state.\\n\\nTypically, Zankowski arrives at a house. She will make her way to a bedroom, often upstairs. The furnishings are sparse. Sometimes the bed is a mattress on the floor.\\n“These are people who have often lost everything they have,” Zankowski says. “It’s not like a nice bedroom.”\\nIn “numerous cases,” she says, a child of the dead person finds the body.\\nWhen she encounters the body for herself, on the bed or on the floor, Zankowski first looks for signs of drug use: lighters, spoons, straws, powder, pill bottles, syringes, alcohol, or needles—sometimes still stuck in the arm.\\n“Inherently, we all stereotype to some degree, and I hate to, but the more that I can paint a typical picture and put it into a category, the better I prepare myself for what I will see,” Zankowski says.\\n‘Closure From Me’\\nZankowski also reaches to learn more than the visible characteristics and facts of the case.\\nShe wants to know the context, an exercise that she hopes brings understanding, and potentially closure, to both herself and the surviving family.\\nZankowski interviews family members and invests in their lives by connecting them with churches or health clinics that can help with recovery from loss.\\n“It’s so shocking, because you talk to the family, who are not being mistrustful to me,” Zankowski says. “They are passing on what they know to the best of their knowledge. They say, I know he’s been straight, he wants to get better. I read his diary. He’s gaining weight. He’s eating. I know he’s healthy—I see his eyes. And then they fall off the wagon. It’s very upsetting.”\\nThis series:\\nPart 1: The Crisis That May Have Swung Voters From Obama to Trump\\nPart 2: One Opioid Addict Helps Another Choose Life Over Death\\nPart 3: ‘Dr. Father Pill’ Wants to Be Part of the Solution\\nPart 4: Police Assault\\xa0on\\xa0Opioids Gets\\xa0Boost From a Family Doctor\\xa0\\nPart 5: The First Responders Who Witness a Dreadful Toll\\nSome families don’t want to talk with Zankowski. To make herself relatable, she dresses normally, without a uniform. She’s not numb to death. She may lose her composure and cry:\\nIf you act like a human being, and show those emotions, you are well received. I have never felt that I was a disadvantage to the situation. I would think I would be perceived as—I don’t want to say the bad guy—but for the medical examiner to be involved, this is a very dark scenario. I am amazed families are able to take some good from it, and maybe they get closure from me.\\n‘The Last Stop’\\nMichael Pearson responds to death in a different way. As the managing director of Jenkins &\\xa0Newman Funeral Home in Colebrook, death is his business.\\n“In this business, we are the last stop,” Pearson says. “We are what happens when the system fails.”\\nPearson, 49, whose tall stature and serious demeanor befit his heavy job, arrives at scenes of all deaths to collect the body and prepare it for burial or cremation.\\n“There are decisions to be made: How are people to be disposed of, are they gonna be buried, are they gonna be cremated, who’s gonna pay the bill,” Pearson says. “I have to deal with who is left behind, even while I am getting the body.”\\nMichael Pearson, managing director of Jenkins & Newman Funeral Home in Colebrook, arrives at scenes of death to collect the body and prepare it for burial or cremation. (Photo: Josh Siegel/The Daily Signal)\\nLike Zankowski, Pearson is struck by the familiarity of death by opioid overdose.\\n“I know from the first call, usually, what I am going to,” Pearson says. “In most opioid overdoses, tests take several weeks to confirm the cause of death. But it’s fairly obvious what the cause was.”\\nJenkins & Newman Funeral Home, which Pearson has run for 15 years, covers Colebrook and a few surrounding towns, with a total population of about 8,000.\\nPearson lives where he works, off Colebrook’s Main Street, in a residential-looking building where the first floor is his office and the second his living quarters.\\nHe was born in Coos County, and has raised a family here. He says he tries to insulate his own children—a son and daughter—from the opioid crisis. His 20-year-old son, the eldest, is in the Navy.\\n“I am not worried about him—he would not go anywhere near this stuff,” Pearson says.\\nPearson empathizes with the dead. But because he interacts with survivors in a transactional manner, Pearson is especially attentive to the ripple effect of a life lost to drug addiction.\\n“We get to see the whole drag that this is on families, society, the area, the economy,” Pearson says. “Most of these people can’t pay my bill. So it’s a drag on my business.”\\n“It’s tragic,” Pearson adds:\\nI don’t understand addiction and stuff like that. If it is a disease and a sickness, we have to learn how to get a hold of it. These people don’t know what they are doing. They don’t know what they are doing to everyone they’ve left behind. It’s over for them. So they don’t care. But the rest of us are like, ‘I shouldn’t be here.’ It’s a bad problem. I don’t know how to solve the problem.\\nRelated by Addiction\\nDown the road from Jenkins & Newman Funeral Home is a cash-only, family-run pizza restaurant, fittingly named Colebrook House of Pizza.\\nInside, Bonnie Hammond, 56, a waitress who is a lifetime Coos County resident, is recalling—without being asked—her relation to the opioid addiction crisis.\\nHer stepson, Jason Wood, was addicted to drugs and alcohol. At 18, Wood enlisted in the Air Force to escape his addiction, which began a few years after his first sip of alcohol as a 12-year-old.\\nBonnie Hammond, a waitress at Colebrook House of Pizza, lost\\xa0a stepson who was addicted to drugs and alcohol. (Photo: Josh Siegel/The Daily Signal)\\nStationed in Alaska as a munitions specialist, Wood came home worse. He took antidepressants and, eventually, opioid painkillers and became addicted to them. He left the Air Force with an honorable discharge, Hammond says.\\nAddiction was in Wood’s blood, Hammond says. His biological father, who Wood did not have a relationship with, died of a drug overdose two years ago, and his mother has battled substance abuse issues.\\nHammond’s husband, Stanley, is not Wood’s biological father. But he was once married to Wood’s mother, and raised Wood since he was 1 years old. So Wood considered Stanley his father figure, and Hammond, his step mother.\\nBack in Colebrook after the military, Wood hit his low point. Someone had stolen money from Hammond, she wrote to friends on Facebook. Wood quickly wrote back, fessing up to being the culprit. Hammond filed a police report accusing him.\\nHammond and Wood forgave each other, and he went to rehab. He moved in with Hammond and Stanley—who do not have biological children of their own—and away from his biological mother.\\nWood settled into an upstairs bedroom in Hammond’s home and tried to take advantage of Coos County’s natural gifts, spending time outside fishing, snowboarding, and four-wheeling.\\nBut his addiction hampered him, its symptoms easy to see and hard to overcome.\\n“He always sweated so bad because his organs were working so hard,” Hammond says. “He tried working and doing things outside, but he’d have to come home and change his clothes a couple times a day because he was so soaked.”\\nHammond tried to help, but she felt caught between caring for her stepson and challenging him.\\n“You enable because it’s your kid,” Hammond says. “I knew my stepson was overly medicated. I knew it was dangerous. But he said he would die without the drugs.”\\nOn a Monday morning, Nov. 19, 2012, Hammond entered Wood’s bedroom, to fetch Stanley’s truck keys. Her stepson had not been answering his cellphone.\\nBefore she could locate the keys, Hammond found Wood slumped over, his body lodged in the foot of space between his bed and the wall behind it.\\n“I knew he was gone,” Hammond says of her stepson, who was 23. “Jason said he didn’t want to live that way anymore. He wanted to know what it was like to be normal, because it had been so long. Now he knows what it’s like to be normal. Now that he’s dead. Now that he’s up there in heaven, he must be normal and not heavily medicated.”\\nJason Wood, an\\xa0Air Force veteran, died at age 23 after battling addiction to drugs and alcohol. (Photo: Courtesy of Bonnie Hammond)\\nPearson, the Colebrook funeral director who works down the street from the pizza shop where Hammond waits tables, recalls the scene similarly.\\nHe responded to Wood’s death, published an obituary, and cremated the body.\\nThe obituary says that Wood died “unexpectedly,” but the cause was clear.\\n“That’s coming back to me,” Pearson says, when reminded of Wood’s death. “I remember this kid. I’ve been to the pizza restaurant.”\\nPearson recounts how removing Wood’s body was difficult: It was sweaty as he put it into a body bag. He had to carry the body down steep stairs to get back outside.\\nHammond lived—and Wood died—about 100 yards from the local hospital where Zankowski, the medical examiner, used to work.\\nCoos County’s opioid drug epidemic had come full circle.\\nIt was too late.\\n“The kid’s parents were very devastated by the whole thing,” Pearson says. “They thought he was getting better. He relapsed. He was in his early 20s, and he is gone forever. He was addicted to drugs, and it killed him.”\\nStart at Part 1:\\xa0The crisis that may have swung Coos County voters from Obama to Trump.',\n",
       " \"The MS-13 gang was originally born on the streets of Los Angeles, but arrived in El Salvador in the early 1990s as many of its ranks were being deported back to their home country by the U.S. government. (Photo: Adriana Zehbrauskas/Polaris/Newscom)\\nIn describing its effort to enforce immigration laws aggressively, the Trump administration repeatedly has invoked the threat of MS-13, a violent international gang with ties to Central America.\\nThe Democrats don't want money from budget going to border wall despite the fact that it will stop drugs and very bad MS 13 gang members.\\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 23, 2017\\n\\nResponding to a recent surge of violence linked to MS-13 on Long Island, New York—punctuated by the April 13 discovery of four men killed near a public park—U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions visited with local law enforcement late last month, and vowed to eradicate the gang by cracking down on illegal immigration.\\n“The MS-13 motto is kill, rape, and control,” Sessions said at the U.S. Courthouse on Long Island. “Our motto is justice for victims and consequences for criminals. That’s how simple it is. Prosecute them, and after they’ve been convicted, if they’re not here lawfully, they’re going to be deported.”\\nIn interviews with The Daily Signal, law enforcement experts who study MS-13—and have been working to help combat it—welcomed President Donald Trump’s tough approach to the gang, but cautioned that the federal government should not lose sight of other violent gangs with footprints in the U.S.\\nAccording to the FBI’s most recent statistics, there are about 33,000 active gangs in the U.S., with about 1.4 million members.\\n“The threat of MS-13 and their violence is real enough, but they are not the only gang in town,” said Wes McBride, the executive director of the California Gang Investigators Association, in an interview with The Daily Signal.\\nExperts such as McBride, who served 28 years in the gang unit of the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Office, say that immigration enforcement is only one element of a strategy that the U.S. has waged for decades against MS-13.\\n“People tend to talk about MS-13 as a gang of illegals, and it sort of is, but a lot of them now were born here, so they are second generation,” McBride said. “This is a long-term problem without a simple solution.”\\n‘Fertile for Gang Proliferation’\\nMara Salvatrucha, known as MS-13, originated in Los Angeles in the 1980s, when thousands of people from El Salvador, a country of Central America’s northern triangle, fled civil war.\\nA 2008 Congressional Research Service report describes MS-13’s early membership as consisting of former guerillas and El Salvadoran government soldiers with combat experience. Those initial members helped the gang develop a reputation of using unusual methods of violence—most prominently, its choice of machetes as a murder weapon.\\n\\nEric Olson, the associate director of the Latin America program at the Wilson Center, said the new arrivals from El Salvador formed MS-13 as a form of self-preservation to compete with other Los Angeles-based gangs.\\n“The Salvadorans were suddenly confronted with Mexican gangs in the high schools, and African-American gangs, so almost as a self-protection thing, they formed cliques and gangs,” Olson told The Daily Signal.\\nOlson and other experts say MS-13 expanded when, in the mid-1990s, the U.S. government changed immigration law to hasten deportation of the gang’s members back to El Salvador.\\nMS-13 became the first street gang to be labeled a “transnational criminal organization”—one that operates internationally—by the U.S. government.\\n“While many of the gang members eventually got deported, they had to reconfigure themselves in El Salvador, and so you had a very vulnerable population fall back on their larger gang family [there] as a protection mechanism,” Olson said. “MS-13 became bigger and more powerful in El Salvador.”\\nNelson Arriaga, president of the International Latino Gang Investigators Association, which provides training to law enforcement conducting anti-gang operations, says the U.S. government did not give proper support to Salvadoran authorities who were ill-equipped to handle the return of their troubled nationals.\\n“Law enforcement in Central America were completely oblivious to the criminal element being exported from the U.S. to those countries, and to the level of sophistication gang members were bringing with them,” Arriaga told The Daily Signal in an interview.\\n“Those countries were fertile for gang proliferation.”\\nAs MS-13 grew its ranks from deportees returning from the U.S. to El Salvador, members also migrated back to the U.S.\\n“When we started deporting them, some would turn around and come right back,” McBride said. “It became a circular problem.”\\nEnforcement Crackdown\\nToday, the Justice Department estimates that MS-13 has roughly 30,000 members worldwide and more than 10,000 in the U.S. MS-13 is active in 40 states plus the District of Columbia, the department estimates, with an especially significant presence on the East Coast, in New York, Virginia, and Maryland.\\nWhile Trump has blamed the Obama administration’s less strict immigration policies for MS-13’s growth, a Justice Department fact sheet, dated April 18, credits “great progress made” by federal, state, and local law enforcement in “diminishing” and disrupting the gang’s impact during 2009 and 2010.\\nIndeed, McBride says he does not blame the Obama administration for the spread of MS-13. The California gang expert notes that President Barack Obama’s Treasury Department in 2012 sanctioned the gang as a transnational criminal organization.\\nIn January 2016, the Justice Department indicted 56 MS-13 members in the Boston area on federal racketeering conspiracy charges, some related to murder, conspiracy to commit murder, attempted murder, and drug trafficking. In March of this year, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York indicted more than a dozen MS-13 members in seven killings on Long Island spanning three years, including the deaths of several high school students last year.\\nThe FBI started an MS-13 National Gang Task Force in 2004 to coordinate the investigative efforts of federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies against the gang.\\nArriaga, a retired sergeant in the Inglewood Police Department who focused on gangs, says the FBI and U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents today are embedded in Central America to help local police in those countries deal with the MS-13 threat.\\n“The MS-13 threat in Central America is on steroids compared to the threat here,” Arriaga said. “It’s good to see the Trump administration making greater emphasis of MS-13, but the enforcement aspect of this has already been there.”\\nThreat ‘Stays Here’\\nDespite these efforts, law enforcement experts acknowledge that MS-13 remains strong.\\nGang members in the U.S. have preyed on recent arrivals from Central America, many of them teenagers who traveled here alone in a surge of illegal immigration from El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala over the past few years.\\n“The best way to tackle the problem is to convince young people to stay away from the gangs,” Sessions said during his April 28 speech in Long Island.\\nWhile MS-13, which has a decentralized structure with little coordination, is not considered a major player in international drug smuggling, Olson said, the gang uses extortion to control local drug markets.\\n“Extortion is really their bread and butter, so if you are in a poor neighborhood and your job isn’t paying enough, or you don’t have a job and sell tortillas on the corner, [MS-13] force you to pay a tax,” Olson said. “They are extorting all economic activity. Their control of legal markets and extortion is absolute. And when they are in conflict with one another and the police, they become extraordinarily violent.”\\nOlson called for a multipronged strategy to defeat MS-13:\\nIt’s not like removing a tumor, where you can cut it out and it’s gone. It stays here. Anti-gang work in the U.S. and in Central America needs to go way beyond simply trying to deport and incarcerate people. I wouldn’t say border security won’t have any impact. It’s already had a big impact. It’s one element of an overall challenge.\",\n",

Says Who?”\\nThe curriculum was pushed by the school district’s ethnic studies program manager, Tracy Castro-Gill, who on Oct. 19 tweeted a picture with her “Marxist ringleader” and said the “next step is matching ‘INDOCTRINATED’ t-shirts!”\\n“I am an educator of color in Seattle whose job is anti-racist work within the school district. Seattle is very white—nearly 70%. It’s also one of the most liberal cities in the US, and these liberal, white Seattleites hate being called racist, but the thing is—a lot of them are,” she\\xa0wrote.\\nThough she was hired by the superintendent and the school board, Castro-Gill said criticisms of the math proposal from one board member’s Asian wife were\\xa0racist. She also asked people to “help me push” the board and superintendent to oppose “rewhiting.”\\nCastro-Gill wrote on her blog that her mother is white and her father is Hispanic, but that she has a strained relationship.\\n“I’m fairly radical atheist and consider myself a far left anarchist who fights for racial justice,” she\\xa0wrote. “My parents are both Trump supporting Republicans.”\\nShe is also at odds with her child’s father after their child declared herself “nonbinary” after reading literature about transgenderism.\\nA spokesman for Seattle’s superintendent, Denise Juneau, did not return a request for comment.\\nMaryland\\nIn Howard County, Maryland, the school board appears poised to proceed with a\\xa0plan, drafted by an out-of-state consultant, to bus 7,300 students out of their neighborhood schools to adjust the distribution of impoverished students in each school—despite that no discernible constituency is asking for it.\\nThe county council said its goal is to “address the achievement gaps by\\xa0racial and socioeconomic factors.” The plan would move students based on how many receive free and reduced meals in those neighborhoods.\\nAdditionally, Howard is the\\xa0most-integrated\\xa0school system in the state, the Baltimore Sun reported. But the county council’s resolution says any school with less than 40% white students is defined as\\xa0segregated.\\nIn Howard County, 39% of students are white, meaning that by its logic, if every school exactly reflected the racial makeup of the county as a whole, every school in Howard County would be segregated.\\nResident Carl Manganillo testified Oct. 10 that the board had heard 2,500 comments with opponents outnumbering supporters of the plan\\xa0100-to-1.\\n“As far as I can tell, the only proponents of this plan are the politicians,” he said.\\nAsian, white, black, and Hispanic parents marched in the streets in\\xa0massive protests. “I want to stay with my friends,” a fourth-grader pleaded. “Keep the ‘unity’ in community,” a black mother urged.\\nMore than 80 people spoke at a hearing Oct. 7, and\\xa0not one of them\\xa0wanted the plan to proceed, CBS’ Baltimore affiliate reported.\\nLori Grant, who is an assistant director at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission—the federal government’s anti-discrimination arm—and the mother of a black student in a Howard school, testified in her personal capacity that the school board should not proceed with the plan and that it is\\xa0likely illegal.\\n“Basically, they could care less what the parents think,” resident George Henry said in a\\xa0letter\\xa0to the Baltimore Sun.\\nWith parents overwhelmingly opposed,\\xa0state politicians\\xa0got in the mix—one\\xa0cutting the line\\xa0of people testifying—to attempt to push the county policy across the finish line.\\nIn a Facebook group that quickly attracted\\xa04,000 members, a near populist revolt fomented, with members pledging to vote every Howard politician out of office.\\nLarry Walker, a member of the Attendance Area Committee that helped\\xa0form the plan, is also a pastor at Celebration Church, and said at a Sept. 8 service: \\nWe have a partnership with the school system and the superintendent is looking for brown people to show up and put our voices behind this plan that he came out with—it’s a bold plan and the community is hatin’ on it right now—they’re hatin’ on it—so he needs … he needs some allies, folks.\\nSchool spokesman Brian Bassett did not respond to questions from The Daily Caller News Foundation about what kind of partnership the government has with a church, and why the superintendent was “looking” for people to support a plan rather than drafting one with organic public support.\\nNew York City\\nIn the nation’s largest school system, a panel appointed by the mayor proposed in August to eliminate the city’s gifted and talented schools and programs in the service of racial integration garnered\\xa0front-page\\xa0New York Times coverage.\\nThe proposal would end the practice of gifted and talented schools screening students by exams and grades—and even block considering students’ attendance records at their previous schools.\\nIt also said it was unfair that students who were\\xa0not fluent in English\\xa0were “underrepresented” in the most rigorous academic programs.\\n“If you get rid of testing, you’re open to subjective decision-making … you’ll see a lot of parents send their children to private schools, and you’re just furthering the income gap,” David Lee of the Chinese American Citizens Alliance told New York’s\\xa0CBS affiliate.\\nRobert Cornegy, a black Democratic city councilman from Brooklyn, told the Times the proposal seemed to come from “uber liberals” and said minorities are not served well by taking the rigor out of education.\\n“If you eliminate the gifted and talented program it eliminates the chances of getting into specialized programs and institutions of higher learning,” he said. “Just like there’s a pipeline to prison, there is a pipeline to higher academic success and college.”\\nJonathan Plucker, a professor at Johns Hopkins University and a member of the National Association for Gifted Children’s board, told the Times, “You can say everyone is being treated the same, but if they are being treated poorly, that’s a horrible form of equity.”\\nStill, New York schools chancellor Richard Carrenza said “this is not about lowering the bar.”\\nIn May, three white school administrators sued Carrenza’s Department of Education for $90 million, saying, “DOE has swiftly and irrevocably silenced, sidelined and punished plaintiffs and other Caucasian female DOE employees on the basis of their race, gender and unwillingness to accept their other colleagues’ hateful stereotypes about them,” the New York Post\\xa0reported.\\nLaShawn Robinson, then the executive director of the DOE’s Office of Equity and Access, said, “Values of white culture are supremacist,” according to the lawsuit. Robinson replaced Lois Herrera, a Harvard graduate who had worked for the schools since 1986, with a black man, stashed her belongings under a stairwell, demoted her three levels, and transferred her to the Bronx, it stated.\\nAnother plaintiff, Jaye Murray, was forced to report her activities to the new boss every 30 minutes, it said. The third plaintiff, Laura Feijoo, was replaced by a black woman who did not have the necessary license to do the job, it stated.\\nSeparately, a fourth white female former employee, Leslie Chislett,\\xa0sued\\xa0New York’s DOE for $20 million. Chislett had spearheaded a campaign to promote Advanced Placement classes for more students, but, “unfortunately, under Chancellor Carranza’s leadership, something has gone very wrong with the Equity and Excellence agenda,” she told the Post.\\nAll DOE employees were forced to undergo “training” sessions that told them a desire for “excellence” was part of “white supremacy,” Chislett’s lawsuit stated.\\n“There is white toxicity in the air,” DOE senior executive Ruby Ababio-Fernandez said in a school presentation, according to the suit.\\nA spokeswoman did not return a request for comment.\\nVirginia\\nIn\\xa0Fairfax County, Virginia, the school board eliminated the position of chief academic officer and\\xa0replaced it\\xa0with chief equity officer. It also proposed revising the boundary-drawing process to remove “instructional effectiveness” and “the impact on neighborhoods” as factors, in favor of “the socioeconomic and/or racial composition of students.”\\nFor 18 months, the board repeatedly discussed an imperative to gain “equity” in school demographics, but with an election Nov. 5, it suddenly sought to distance itself from the rhetoric.\\nThe board is “not considering boundary adjustments at this time,” spokeswoman Kathleen Thomas told The Daily Caller News Foundation.\\nThe school system hired a consultant to study boundary changes in the context of its “equity” policy. Parent Laura Timmins told The Daily Caller News Foundation she suspects the board is looking to offload it onto a third party to shield politicians from blowback for moves that are unpopular with residents.\\nPrior to community uproar, the board seemed to recognize that residents would not be in favor of the plan, and that subtlety would be imperative. \\nBoard member Karen Keys-Gamarra said in a school board meeting, “I have no problem with certainly alerting the community as gently as we can, because, like you, I’m not sure I want to hear about this for the next 10 years.”\\nWhen constituents from an area with a high-performing school told their school board member, Janie Strauss, that such changes could plummet their home values, Strauss flatly\\xa0denied\\xa0any changes were afoot. But she also told colleagues at a board meeting she had “warned” the school’s community that a “big chunk is going to be reboundaried.”\\nBoard member Pat Hynes appeared to acknowledge that removing children from their schools in the name of racial integration would be for naught if the existence of rigorous honors classes still separated children based on test scores.\\n“Changing school boundaries must be primary tool of integrating schools for diversity. But equally important is ending counter-productive sorting-and-separating that creates\\xa0segregated schools-within-schools. Goal = integrated classrooms,” she tweeted from a presentation at the National School Board Association’s 2019 conference.\\nIn one school in Fairfax,\\xa078%\\xa0of students failed “plain English Algebra” and 30% failed a basic competency test in English, leading Timmins and other parents in the second-richest county in the U.S. to wonder how their children could apply to competitive colleges if they were required to take the same classes.\\nThe racial focus of the 12-person school board—fueled by its eight white Democrats—led liberal residents to turn against the party, with one saying she’s cast ballots for Democrats in\\xa0every election since 1971, but “when it comes to this year’s County level races, that will not happen.”\\nMinnesota\\nIn July, Eastern Carver County, Minnesota—which is\\xa087% white—revealed it had hired Muhammad Khalifa\\xa0to do an “equity audit.”\\nIt also hired Keith Brooks as director of equity, who compared himself to\\xa0Trayvon Martin\\xa0and\\xa0said,\\xa0“My questioning, or asking questions, or looking at things through an equity lens comes off as belligerent or angry.”\\nIn protest against a board they perceived as being unresponsive to their constituency, some residents pledged to vote in November to\\xa0deny\\xa0a\\xa0funding request\\xa0the school system says is needed for a new school.\\n“Khalifa was paid $90,000, Dr. Brooks got $138,000, and you’re saying you don’t have enough money for education, then what are you spending it on this stuff for?” Lynn McHale, a member of Parents for D112 schools, told The Daily Caller News Foundation.\\n“There’s a girl who came home from school and cried and said, ‘I wish I wasn’t white,’ after she was exposed to this ‘equity’ stuff,” she said.\\n“The superintendents of the nearby jurisdictions have joined into a group called Reimagine Minnesota, and it’s pushing race,” she continued. She suspects it wants to “consolidate into one metropolitan school district, where they would bus inner-city kids from Minneapolis to the suburbs,” relating to a lawsuit called Cruz-Guzman. Reimagine Minnestoa says its\\xa0purpose\\xa0is a “collective action plan to address integration.”\\nCeli Haga, a school spokeswoman, told The Daily Caller News Foundation the school’s system was not fulfilling its mission “as long as the outcomes for groups of students are meaningfully different.”\\nAt a contentious,\\xa0standing room-only\\xa0school board meeting, when residents voiced opposition to the increasing role of race in education, “they told us not to clap, that they would shut down the meeting.”\\nSome people who spoke in favor of the initiatives were teachers in the school system, taking up limited time from parents. McHale said teachers have been told not to voice criticism of the initiative.\\n“The way I view it is a coach should try to make everyone a better player, but you never hold someone back,” she said.\\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

They are here to change the results of election; & Broward is where they plan to do it.” (Photo: Joshua Roberts/Reuters/Newscom)\\nRepublican Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is warning that the fate of his state’s governorship could hang in the hands of Florida’s Broward County Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes, whom he’s called incompetent for violating state and federal laws. A liberal candidate similarly painted her as incompetent and corrupt.\\nDemocratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum initially conceded the Florida race to Republican Ron DeSantis, but backtracked after vote totals changed Thursday, narrowing the gap to less than half a percent in both the gubernatorial and senatorial races. Broward County is often the slowest of the state’s 67 counties to count votes, and its election department has repeatedly been faulted for wrongdoing.\\n\\nNow, Perkins Coie lawyer Marc Elias has been enlisted in a recount effort. Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson is retaining Elias, who said it’s “not plausible” that, as Broward statistics suggest, 14,000 people voted in sometimes-obscure state-level races but left the Senate one blank.\\nRepublican Gov. Rick Scott, who, by initial appearances, beat Nelson in a race for Senate, said Elias will use aggressive techniques to “steal” the election.\\nElias worked for both the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 election, even before the 2016 presidential candidate became the Democratic nominee, when the two were supposed to be independent. Coie also hired Fusion GPS during that election to investigate then-candidate Donald Trump, which ultimately resulted in an unverified dossier being sent to the FBI.\\n“Democrat lawyers are descending on Florida,” Rubio tweeted Thursday. “They have been very clear they aren’t here to make sure every vote is counted. They are here to change the results of election; & Broward is where they plan to do it.”\\nNow democrat lawyers are descending on #Florida.

They claim to be incompetent, but my impression is it’s partly a ruse.”\\nPolling and early voting results showed him performing well in 2016, then the reported results rapidly shifted to favor Wasserman Schultz, leading him to suspect manipulation.\\n“So we put in a public records request to inspect some of the ballots, and if inspecting the paper ballot matched up, then it’s done, it will satisfy everyone,” Canova told The Daily Caller News Foundation. “But the supervisor of elections stonewalled me for months.”\\n“I was told they didn’t have scanned images, even though on election night they put the ballots through a scanner. So we filed a discovery request to see the paper ballots,” he continued. “Three days later [Snipes] signed an order to destroy the ballots and certified that they were not the subject to ongoing litigation.”\\n“Her excuse was she just signed anything put in front of her and didn’t read it,” Canova said. “Then she said the ballots were put in the wrong place and that’s why they were destroyed. She concealed the destruction for two weeks.”\\nSnipes’ position is an elected one, and she is a Democrat.\\nCanova said even though Snipes admitted to destroying the ballots in a videotaped deposition, the government continued to fight the case.\\n“They’re using taxpayer money while bleeding us dry.”\\nCanova questioned why Scott and state Attorney General Pam Bondi, who’s also a Republican, didn’t pursue Snipes for criminal prosecution.

       " 'Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., speaks at a America Welcomes event at Union Station on May 16, 2019, in Washington, D.C. (Photo: \\nTasos Katopodis/ Stringer/Getty Images)\\nRep. Ilhan Omar swore under oath in a 2017 divorce filing that she hadn’t seen her husband Ahmed N. Elmi in six years and didn’t know anyone who might be able to locate him—yet he appears to have designed a website for Omar’s sister this year, according to data hidden in the source code of that website.\\nThe Democratic Minnesota congresswoman swore that she had not been able to locate the man she married—who the Minneapolis Star Tribune says may or may not be her brother—since 2011. \\nShe swore she didn’t know the names of anyone in her husband’s family and that the two had no mutual acquaintances who might know how to contact him.\\nAccording to Elmi’s Facebook profile, after attending college in North Dakota, he moved to England and then to Nairobi, Kenya—the same city where Omar’s sister, Sahra Noor, lives and works as CEO of Grit Partners. \\nGrit Partners’ website code contains data that indicates Elmi was involved in the creation of either the company’s website or its Instagram account.\\nThe ties between Omar’s supposedly long-lost ex-husband and Omar’s sister appear to contradict Omar’s sworn testimony and add to the body of evidence that the ex-husband may be her brother, making all three siblings.\\nOther elements of her sworn filing also contain discrepancies. \\nIn arguing that she should be granted a divorce without her husband’s consent because he could not be located, she claimed that she did not know the name of a single member of her husband’s immediate family. \\nShe also claimed that her attempts to find him included unsuccessfully searching on social media—but he has been on Twitter\\xa0since 2012 and\\xa0Facebook\\xa0since 2007 and is also on\\xa0LinkedIn\\xa0and other platforms.\\nLying on a sworn form is perjury and each charge carries\\xa0five years in prison, according to Minnesota law. Questions have been raised about the accuracy of approximately six statements on the sworn form.\\nHidden Code\\nGrit Partners’\\xa0website\\xa0contains code generated by its web design software Squarespace that includes certain data that is not visible on the page itself. \\nIn a section of code powering the site’s links to its Twitter and Instagram pages, Elmi’s name is included, tying him to the Instagram account. It says “screenname: Ahmed Elmi” and “UserName: ahmednelmi.”\\nElmi’s LinkedIn says he works as a freelance creator of “content, communications strategies and editorial for nonprofits, start-ups and global brands.”\\nThe hidden code was discovered by\\xa0David Steinberg, a veteran journalist most recently with PJ Media, who has published significant information about Elmi over the last years. \\nHe has previously published screenshots that appear to show the person with the “ahmednelmi” Instagram was photographed with Omar during the period that Omar swore she had no contact with him, had the same birthdate as Omar’s husband, and held Omar’s baby soon after it was born, calling her his “niece.”\\nDemocratic activist Barb Lickness confirmed to the Star Tribune that the man in one of those screenshots—billed as being from Omar’s Instagram and depicting the now-congresswoman with Elmi in London in 2015—was the same Ahmed Elmi who was a neighbor of hers in Minneapolis but who never mentioned being married.\\nThe media has been hesitant to accept the screenshots as proof that Elmi is Omar’s brother because the Instagram accounts were deleted, so the papers could not independently corroborate the screenshots’ authenticity.\\nHowever, the Grit Partners code is still online and has been corroborated by The Daily Caller News Foundation. \\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation also archived it on the Internet Archive\\xa0and another\\xa0archiving service\\xa0so that date-stamped copies are preserved even if the website is changed. It can be verified by right-clicking, selecting “view source” and searching for Elmi’s name.\\nDomain registration records show the Grit Partners website was registered on Jan. 10, 2019, and the code that mentions Elmi’s name says the Instagram account was linked to the site on Jan. 17.\\nA Missing Husband\\nOmar requested a “default” divorce from Elmi in 2017, an unusual proceeding used where one spouse has disappeared and cannot be located. \\nSince the process deprives one party of contesting the divorce, it required Omar to swear under oath that she had no clues whatsoever about how to contact him through other people.\\nOn the form above, she swears her “most recent contact” with Elmi was in June 2011 in London and the “last known location of respondent’s employment” was unknown.\\nShe swears the “names and locations of respondent’s parents, siblings, children and other close relatives are as follows: Unknown.”\\nShe swears the “names and locations of other persons who are likely to know the respondent’s whereabouts are: Unknown to me.”\\nIt continues: “I believe that it is not likely that respondent’s location will become known to me, but there is a reasonable possibility that mail will be forwarded or otherwise reach respondent if addressed as follows: No known address.”\\nThe document says, “I have made the following efforts to locate the respondent: Looked for on Social media.” It concludes: “I declare under penalty of perjury that everything I have stated in this document is true and correct.” It is signed and dated Aug. 2, 2017.\\nThe Most Recent in a Line of Unanswered Questions About Her Marriage\\nOmar visited Nairobi in December 2016, days after winning election to the Minnesota state Legislature and not long before the divorce papers were sworn, PJ Media reported. \\nFrom Nairobi, she flew to Somalia. Omar praised the newly formed Somalian government in a speech in March 2017. Two days later, Noor’s husband, Mohamed Keynan, got a top political job working for Somalia’s prime minister, PJ Media reported.\\nThis month, the Minnesota Campaign Finance and Public Disclosure Board fined Omar in an investigation that revealed she filed joint\\xa0tax returns with another man\\xa0during her marriage to Elmi. That man also fathered children with Omar both before and after the marriage to Elmi.\\nOmar “was living with her current husband, Ahmed Abdisalan Hirsi,\\xa0throughout her entire legal marriage\\xa0to Ahmed Nur Said Elmi, contradicting the story she tells to explain her multiple marriages,”\\xa0the Washington Examiner reported Sunday based on an extensive review of local records such as speeding tickets that display addresses.\\nThe Star Tribune wrote Saturday that “New investigative documents released by a state agency”—detailing Omar’s frantic formation of a “crisis committee” to try to keep the press from examining the nature of her relationship to Elmi—“have given fresh life to lingering questions about the marital history of Rep. Ilhan Omar and whether she once married a man—possibly her own brother—to skirt immigration laws.”\\n“Omar’s sister Sahra Noor was a high-profile executive of the Twin Cities health care nonprofit People’s Center Clinics & Services until 2018. She declined interview requests in 2016. She currently runs her own health care consultancy in Kenya. An e-mail to her was not returned and efforts to call her there were unsuccessful,” the Star Tribune\\xa0reported.\\nNoor did not return a request for comment from The Daily Caller News Foundation.\\nOmar’s spokesman, Jeremy Slevin, also did not respond to a request for comment from The Daily Caller News Foundation. \\nTo the Star Tribune, he responded with an ad hominem saying the questions from the district’s largest media outlet were illegitimate because conservative-leaning media had also asked them and that attempts to get to the bottom of the story by asking members of Omar’s family amounted to harassment.\\n“Whether by colluding with right-wing outlets to go after Muslim elected officials or hounding family members, legitimate media outlets have a responsibility not to fan the flames of hate,” he said.\\nContent created by\\xa0The Daily Caller News Foundation\\xa0is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

       " \"Secretary of Veterans Affairs David Shulkin, who says someone impersonated his chief of staff in one or more emails, testifies Feb. 15 to a House committee on the agency's budget.      (Photo: Joshua Roberts/Reuters/ Newscom) \\nIn an interview, Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin\\xa0detailed new claims that his agency was hacked or spoofed, but the VA released a statement within the hour saying it could find no evidence of compromised emails.\\n“It was a request to wire money out of the VA to somewhere else,” Shulkin said of one email in the interview Friday with The Daily Caller News Foundation.\\nRep. Mike\\xa0Coffman, R-Colo., said the discrepancy between Shulkin and his own agency appeared to be evidence of an attempt to “muddy the waters” around an investigation that led to the resignation of Shulkin’s chief of staff.\\n\\nAn inspector general’s report released Wednesday said taxpayers were billed wrongfully for Shulkin’s wife’s travel to Europe.\\nThat report hinged upon findings that the VA secretary’s longtime chief of staff, Vivieca Wright Simpson,\\xa0changed a June 2017 email\\xa0to facilitate the payments for the trip.\\nOn Thursday, Shulkin implied to a House committee that Simpson might not have been responsible for that email, and rather, it might have been a\\xa0hacker impersonating her. He insisted that his department has “found there are\\xa0people sending\\xa0emails from her account that aren’t her.”\\nIn a videotaped interview Friday at the offices of The Daily Caller News Foundation, Shulkin said his assertions of hacking rested upon an impersonation attempt that occurred hours before he told the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee about a history of such activity.\\nOn the day the inspector general’s report came out, an email sent from his chief of staff’s account requested a suspicious wire transfer of funds from the VA, he said.\\n“It was a request to wire money out of the VA to somewhere else,” Shulkin said. “Fortunately our finance department thought that was an unusual request and brought it to our attention, so there was no money sent out.”\\nHe added:\\nThe finance department came to Mrs. Wright Simpson on Wednesday morning and said, ‘Why are you requesting a wire transfer outside the VA?’ and they brought her the email, and she said, ‘I never wrote that email.’ Mrs. Simpson’s email was being impersonated by someone else.\\n\\nShulkin said the financial request was “hacking” or “spoofing,” and did not actually come from Simpson.\\n“Wednesday was the first time that I was aware of that single situation, and certainly want to make sure that we understand whether it was an isolated situation or something more extensive. … I don’t know whether this is related to the approval of the travel, that’s something we want to understand, but we don’t have any evidence of that right now.”\\n“The motivation was a financial crime,” Shulkin said.\\n‘No Evidence’\\nIt was not clear what motive an impersonator would have for altering an email to help Shulkin’s wife, Merle Bari, book a trip, and the VA secretary acknowledged that “we have no evidence that that’s related to the IG report, none at all.”\\nAn hour after he left The Daily Caller News Foundation’s newsroom Friday afternoon, the VA’s website posted a statement saying it had found no evidence of any hack, either in June or Wednesday.\\n“We have thus far found\\xa0no credible\\xa0or conclusive evidence of a compromise to our email system or a user’s account,” it said.\\nSome observers questioned Shulkin’s claims that someone was impersonating his chief of staff and said they were suspicious that his allegations coincided with the release of the inspector general’s report.\\n“Based on the timing and the VA’s own press release, which found no evidence of an outside intrusion, this appears like it could be a setup, a faked hack,” said Coffman, a member of the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee. “I think that’s very suspicious.

       " 'The San Francisco Board of Education unanimously voted last month in favor of painting over a George Washington mural series on a school wall depicting Washington standing over a Native American’s corpse and another in the company of slaves on his Mount Vernon estate. Pictured: Portrait of George Washington at age 64 renouncing his third term as president, by Gilbert Stuart. (Photo: GraphicaArtis/Getty Images)\\nThe San Francisco Board of Education unanimously voted last month in favor of painting over a George Washington mural series on a school wall depicting Washington standing over a Native American’s corpse and another in the company of slaves on his Mount Vernon estate.\\n“This is reparations,” Education Board Commissioner Mark Sanchez said in a KQED report when asked about the estimated $600,000 price tag for its removal. It could reportedly take a year to complete.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe 1,600-square-foot mural series titled “Life of Washington” was painted on San Francisco’s George Washington High School in 1936 by a Russian-American artist and Stanford University art professor Victor Arnautoff. \\nIt was funded by the New Deal’s Works Progress Administration and shows a variety of scenes from Washington’s life. \\nSchool district spokeswoman Laura Dudnick confirmed that although only two mural pieces stand out as offensive to members of the community, the board’s decision would apply to all 13 panels of the mural.\\xa0\\nSchool board members had to decide whether to cover and preserve the painting using panels or textile, or completely erase it by painting over it. Buckling under pressure from those who find the images offensive to certain members of the school community, the board decided to paint over it.\\xa0\\nAdvocates for removing the mural included local high school students, George Washington High School graduates, and Native Americans. \\nDuring a public comment portion of the June 25 meeting, Paloma Flores, program coordinator for the district’s Indian Education Program, said, per KQED, “It’s not a matter of offense, it’s a matter of the right to learn without a hostile environment.”\\n“Intent does not negate lived experience,” she added. \\nAccording to KQED, mural critics in the community “believe the artist’s intentions are irrelevant in light of the harm to young people of color daily confronted by images of their ancestors debased.”\\nNative American Barbara Mumby-Huerta, who staffs the San Francisco Art Commission, challenged statements on historical accuracy, saying that the mural is ignorant of indigenous people. \\n“To portray a Native person face down, dead, you are trapping their soul so that they can not move on,” she said, per KQED.\\nOne mural supporter says he plans to legally challenge the move to paint over the mural. Lope Yap Jr., vice president of the school’s alumni group, vowed to “use every tactic available” for litigation, according to KQED.\\xa0\\nBefore the school board meeting, the San Francisco Chronicle polled art leaders in the Bay Area about the controversy.\\xa0\\n“I am deeply sensitive to the pain that this situation is causing the student body and Washington High School community,” said Neal Benezra, director of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.\\n“A decision to paint over the mural is irreversible,” he added. “The option to cover the artwork with panels to allow future educational research keeps open that opportunity.”\\nJarrett Stepman of The Daily Signal wrote about the removal of the mural, citing a historian’s account of Arnautoff, “a man of the left in his own time,” and his intention of making Washington “less glamorized” by painting images of the slaves he owned or the price paid with Native Americans’ blood during westward expansion.\\nIn his interview with historian Fergus M. Bordewich, Bordewich explains: \\n[Arnautoff] included those images not to glorify Washington, but rather to provoke a nuanced evaluation of his legacy. The scene with the dead Native American, for instance, calls attention to the price of ‘manifest destiny.’ Arnautoff’s murals also portray the slaves with humanity and the several live Indians as vigorous and manly.\\nThose who condemn the murals have misunderstood it, seeing only what they sought to find. They’ve also got their history seriously wrong. Washington did own slaves—124 men, women, and children—and oversaw many more who belonged to his wife’s family. But by his later years he had evolved into a proto-abolitionist, a remarkable ethical journey for a man of his time, place, and class.\\nThe removal of the mural is expected to take at least a year, according to district staff. Before proceeding with painting over the mural, its historical significance requires an environmental review. \\nIn the case that the painting takes more time than expected, the district could cover it with panels. Three years, Sanchez said, would be considered “undue delay.” ',\n",

Send an email to Jarrett. He is also the author of the new book,  \"The War on History: The Conspiracy to Rewrite America\\'s Past.\"\\nIs America destined to become like California?\\nTwitter CEO Jack Dorsey created a stir recently when he tweeted out an article calling for an end to bipartisanship and the beginning of nationwide, one-party rule—similar to the Golden State. He called it a “great read.”\\nGreat read https://t.co/O2djSQf8Qv\\n— jack (@jack) April 6, 2018\\n\\nA Twitter spokesperson told The Daily Signal in an email, “Twitter’s tools are apolitical, and we enforce our rules without political bias.”\\nNevertheless, the tweet certainly brings up concern over Twitter’s political bias.\\nThe article, titled “The Great Lesson of California in America’s New Civil War,” argued that due to the intractable division of worldviews in America, bipartisanship is unworkable. It’s time to simply obliterate the other side.\\nThe article was authored by Peter Leyden, the CEO of a media company called Reinvent, and Ruy Teixeira, a progressive political scientist. Teixeira argued after Barack Obama’s 2008 election victory that the GOP would go extinct for a generation because demographic trends would make Democrats unbeatable.\\nNeedless to say, that didn’t come true.\\nBut in a larger sense, it’s worth dissecting what a disaster the Californization of the whole country would be.\\nThe authors point to California as a model for America’s political future. They explain how a once-bitterly divided state transformed into a state dominated by one party in a very short period of time—and they tout this as a good thing.\\nThe problem in their analysis is that they essentially compare apples to oranges. The factors involved in California’s swing to one-party dominance were unique to California and can’t necessarily be applied to the country at large.\\nMoreover, Democratic Party dominance in California doesn’t necessarily mean Californians have become more progressive or that progressive policies have worked.\\nAs a native Californian who has left the state, I witnessed California’s terrible turn firsthand.\\nSeveral factors went into this political sea change.\\n‘Jungle Primaries’ and Redistricting\\nCalifornia hasn’t always been a deep blue state. At one time it voted consistently for Republican presidential candidates, even up into the 1990s. But the state has gone leftward since that time, a situation fueled by both electoral and cultural changes.\\nIn 2010, the state passed a new law requiring candidates to participate in a single consolidated open primary, often called the “jungle primary.” In these primaries, the top two vote-getters end up on the election ballot, where they square off against each other. This system has driven many Republicans off the election ballot, as the top two slots are often won by Democrats.\\nSome Republicans originally backed the jungle primary law, including then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. They hoped it would help moderate candidates in elections and thus make the state more bipartisan.\\nBut what has happened is the exact opposite. This law made California ripe for one-party rule.\\nAs The Daily Signal’s Fred Lucas wrote in The American Conservative, it led to bizarre absurdities, such as Democrat Sen. Dianne Feinstein being labeled the “Republican” option in a Senate race due to the fact that her only opponent was a more militant progressive than her.\\nReal political challengers are simply drowned out by the number of progressive voters in these primaries, and so a single ideology with only minor variance gets represented in the general election, as was the case in 2016 where Donald Trump was the only Republican on the ballot for a statewide election.\\nLarry N. Gerston, a professor emeritus of political science at San Jose State University, wrote for the Los Angeles Times that the jungle primary not only wiped out the Republican Party in California, it wiped out third parties that previously could challenge the status quo.\\n“California reformers argued that the major parties were dominated by extremes on the left and the right, and that a top-two system would attract centrist candidates, especially in districts where one party was dominant,” Gerston wrote. “They also contended that more competitive races would increase turnout. Early studies show that neither expectation has been met.”\\nIn addition to the one-sided jungle primary system, a redistricting plan in 2010 tightened Democrats’ grip on the state. Initially billed as a nonpartisan effort to do away with gerrymandering, the plan was hijacked by state Democrats who stacked the commission with progressive activists posing as “Republicans.”\\nThis further wiped out opposition to the Democratic Party in the state over the last decade.\\n>>> Eliminating Partisan Redistricting Will Make Politics Worse, Not Better\\nMiddle-Class Californians Flee in Droves\\nAnother major factor in California’s shift to the left is changing demographics. Many point to immigration as the primary reason for this shift, but flight has also played a significant role as people leave the state.\\nFor a state that progressives tout as the ideal, there has been a remarkable amount of migration away from California in the last decade. Discontented Californians are voting with their feet, and those feet are moving with a quickening pace.\\nThough Leyden and Teixeira wrote that Republican policies have “engorged the rich while flatlining the incomes of the majority of Americans,” it’s actually been middle-income Californians who are fleeing the state while rich Americans from the Northeast trickle in.\\n“People making $55,000 or less a year were mostly moving out of California between 2007 and 2016 … while people making more than $200,000 a year moved in,” according to one report described in The San Diego Union-Tribune.\\nAccording to real estate website Curbed:\\nDue in large part to the state’s housing crisis, California is becoming wealthier and more economically stratified, as more of its citizens find it difficult to make ends meet. Every year, the state falls roughly 100,000 units short of what it needs to keep up with housing demand. That’s driving many middle-class residents out of the state, with little hope of returning.\\nWith so many middle-income people leaving, what is left over in California is a two-tiered system of rich and poor in which the rich thrive and the poor muddle along.\\nRemarkably, this amazingly rich state now has the country’s highest poverty rates and lowest rating for “quality of life.”\\nHow can this be?\\nA Basket Case\\n“California’s de facto status as a one-party state lies at the heart of its poverty problem,” wrote Kerry Jackson, the Pacific Research Institute’s fellow in California studies. “With a permanent majority in the state Senate and the Assembly, a prolonged dominance in the executive branch, and a weak opposition, California Democrats have long been free to indulge blue-state ideology while paying little or no political price. The state’s poverty problem is unlikely to improve while policymakers remain unwilling to unleash the engines of economic prosperity that drove California to its golden years.”\\nWith their opposition made toothless, progressives have been free to conduct their policy experiments unopposed. The results leave much to be desired.\\nThe irony is that California now veers closer to the repressive Republican caricature that Leyden and Teixeira described in their piece rather than the progressive utopia they say they want for the whole country.\\nThe state increasingly stands out in the union as an extremist and increasingly dysfunctional basket case. Wealthy residents can withstand the state’s failures, but everyone else is paying the price of bad policy.\\nWhile the harmful effects of progressive policies are statewide, and often fall hardest on the redder communities within the state, no city better reflects the end result of California-style progressivism than San Francisco.\\nThough it is one of the wealthiest cities in the country, San Francisco is becoming known for its notorious homelessness problem, escalating crime rates, and various other pathologies.\\nOne FBI report noted that while overall property crime rates were down around the country in 2017, San Francisco’s rates had jumped by 20 percent in just a year.\\nThe Federalist’s John Davidson wrote in an expose on the disintegration of this marvelously wealthy, yet increasingly dystopian city.\\nHere was the perfect chance for progressives to create their ideal society. With no political opposition for a generation and fabulous wealth coming in through the tech boom, it should have been easy to transform this iconic and perfectly located city into exactly what they wanted.\\nBut Davidson poignantly notes that San Francisco fails when judged by the standards of progressives themselves.\\n“The absence of any organized political opposition, combined with its vast wealth, makes San Francisco a kind of proof-of-concept for progressive governance,” Davidson wrote.\\n“ … That’s why the housing and homelessness problems besetting the city open it up to more than mere mockery from conservatives but substantive criticism of progressive governance writ large,” Davidson continued. “It’s not just homeless encampments that bedevil San Francisco, but also the flight of the middle class and the emergence of a kind of citywide caste system: the wealthy, the service class, and the destitute. In some ways, San Francisco is becoming something progressives are supposed to hate: a private club for the super-rich.”\\nSan Francisco has managed to create an environment that progressives claim to abhor most. It is a tragic display of how bad ideas, regardless of intentions, lead to dysfunction.\\nAnd those very ideas that are eating away at San Francisco are increasingly the dominant ideology in the state capital.\\nIt’s no wonder that so many middle-income Californians are fleeing to more hospitable states like Nevada and Texas.\\nSome of these states, like Texas, are now actively encouraging California citizens and businesses to leave California to escape high housing costs, overbearing regulations, and punitive taxes.\\nNot only that, but some conservative expatriates have actually created organizations to help conservative Californians settle into Texas communities that better reflect their values.\\nAnd it’s working.\\nThe result is that the state’s blue politics is rapidly becoming bluer as conservative constituencies ditch the state for greener pastures.\\nResisting the #Resistance\\nCalifornia may be losing residents, and it may have institutional barriers that make it unlikely to see a serious change in state policies.\\nHowever, this doesn’t mean that there isn’t still a significant portion of the population that resents and opposes the actions of the state government.\\nWhile the California government is resisting the federal government and the Trump administration, many Californians are themselves resisting “the resistance.”\\nAs The New York Times reported of the mostly rural, northernmost parts of California:\\nMany liberals in California describe themselves as the resistance to Mr. Trump. Residents of the north say they are the resistance to the resistance, politically invisible to the Democratic governor and legislature. California’s strict regulations on the environment, gun control, and hunting impinge on a rural lifestyle, they say, that urban politicians do not understand.\\nIt’s not just the rural north and central valley that oppose the state’s direction. Several counties have come out in opposition to the state’s sanctuary policies that have provoked a legal battle with the Trump administration’s agenda.\\nOrange County in Southern California recently passed measures aimed at aiding the federal government in immigration enforcement. More cities and localities have joined it and others are likely to follow suit.\\nThere have even been a few proposals to break up the state into a few smaller states. One such plan has been proposed by tech billionaire Tim Draper, though this will likely have difficulty getting approved by Congress.\\nThe fact is, California is not so monolithic as it often appears to outsiders, despite the one-sided vision coming from the state’s capital and from Hollywood.\\nCalifornia may have one-party rule, but there is a festering opposition among the governed, many of whom are resentful that their voices are ignored in the halls of power.\\nThis cauldron is a far cry from the blissful one-party rule that Leyden and Teixeira have predicted for the future.\\nAnd good luck bringing California-style governance to its red-state neighbors, which are now filled with ex-Californians who, like Paul Revere, are sounding the alarm about what’s to come.\\nAs former California Assemblyman Chuck DeVore, who now lives in Texas and serves as vice president of the Texas Public Policy Foundation, wrote for Fox News, “California isn’t the future, rather, it’s what America’s 2016 election of Donald Trump saved the nation from becoming. It’s not a harbinger of things to come, but it will soon be an example of the fate we narrowly avoided.”\\nCalifornia’s fall from being the quintessential American dream to a series of gated communities surrounded by poverty is no model for the rest of the country. To the contrary, it is a dire warning.\\nThe year the law creating California’s jungle primary passed has been corrected',\n",

Bordewich, Arnautoff included images of slavery and violence against Indians as a way to present a less glamorized view of Washington. Bordewich wrote in April:\\n[Arnautoff] included those images not to glorify Washington, but rather to provoke a nuanced evaluation of his legacy. The scene with the dead Native American, for instance, calls attention to the price of ‘manifest destiny.’ Arnautoff’s murals also portray the slaves with humanity and the several live Indians as vigorous and manly.\\nThose who condemn the murals have misunderstood it, seeing only what they sought to find.

But by his later years he had evolved into a proto-abolitionist, a remarkable ethical journey for a man of his time, place, and class.\\nSo we are now squabbling with the past over exactly how to negatively portray American history. A single misstep or disagreement means erasure.\\nHistory must be squeezed and jabbed and manipulated to fit our exact conception of how the present should be; it’s an ethos that exposes the additional problem with the seemingly reasonable suggestions that statues, memorials, and murals be consigned to a museum and given “context.”\\nThe problem is, removing a memorial from its original place already takes it out of context. Worse, the work of art or piece of history—whatever it may be—is increasingly likely to be subjected to hectoring and ideologically blinkered screeds aimed at modern political opponents.\\nHistory will take a back seat to ideology.\\nPerhaps, at the end of the day, we should expect Americans to make the best judgments about history themselves.\\nThat’s not good enough for far-left activists, who are less concerned with creating new monuments to worthy Americans and more interested in seeking out and destroying everything that stands as a proxy for what they hate.\\nAnd their hate runs deep.\\nIt seems, especially given what polls suggest about the various statue controversies, most of this movement is being driven by bureaucrats and a relentless faction of other engaged activists rather than the American people as a whole.\\nNevertheless, these activists have been effective at pushing their agenda at the national level down to the local level.\\nControversies are created where there is none, grievance merchants stay in business, and ideologues who want to deconstruct America to fit their worldview get their way.\\nIt’s ugly business and does nothing to stop racism or end prejudice. If anything, this behavior heightens the politics of sheer power and annihilation.\\xa0\\nThe message is: Everything we disagree with must be silenced or destroyed; the world must be remade in whatever image we desire—regardless of truth or those who dissent.\\nWhat this incident will hopefully elucidate is that the war on history and statues was never simply about history, per se. One can debate the nature of Confederate statues or the merits of individual historical figures marked for destruction, but that misses the larger aims of this movement.\\nThe movement intends to create indelible identities of oppressor and oppressed where “my truth” is more important than “the truth,” and bonds of American solidarity and concepts such as e pluribus unum—out of many, one—are made unworkable.\\nAnd that outcome is what Americans of goodwill must oppose at every turn.\\nAs I wrote in May, when this battle over the Washington mural began heating up: “These movements are forcing politics to infect every corner of our existence, and that weakens this country. It makes us more hateful toward one another and trains us in the un-American notion that to win arguments, we must quash, liquidate, and erase from all memory those we disagree with.”\\nFor this reason, we must stand up and defend our shared American history, to oppose the erasure of old statues and monuments, and relentlessly work to bring informed patriotism to generations of Americans who have been stripped of that virtue.\\xa0',\n",

For many small businesses, which often run on very tight margins, those sorts of losses can be devastating.\\nAnd the total cost to the state will likely be in the billions of dollars. Even for an economic giant like California, that’s unsustainable.\\xa0 \\nBusinesses already have to deal with a challenging tax and regulatory environment in California. But for those that sustain massive losses every time the power shuts off—which could become a frequent event now, unless a dramatic change in policies occurs quickly—the cost of doing business there may just be too much.\\nOf course, the powers that be in California are trying to shift the blame for this politician-made, preventable disaster onto climate change, corporate “greed,” and President Donald Trump.\\nUSA Today reported that California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said the whole mess was “not a climate change story as much as a story about greed and mismanagement over the course of decades. … Neglect. A desire to advance not public safety, but profits.”\\nThe fact is, it was the state’s overwhelming desire to go green that pushed PG&E, a powerful state utility with a government-backed monopoly, to skimp on safety and measures that could have lessened fire risks.\\nAdditionally, Trump is correct to point out that environmentalism and poor land management have played a huge role in making California, which has historically had a hot, dry fire season, a tinderbox ready to ignite.\\nPG&E, with the blessing of the governor-appointed and legislature-approved California Public Utilities Commission, is allowed to mandate power shut-offs at the peak of fire season to limit the damage to the state, which bankrupted the utility in January.\\nThe current proposals to rectify the situation—like having the state take over PG&E—would only make things worse, especially for the middle class.\\nAs The Wall Street Journal noted about plans for a state takeover of PG&E:\\nDemocrats are accusing PG&E of putting profits over safety, but the utilities commission approves its return on equity based on what’s needed to attract private investment. Utility shareholders are typically older folks who rely on dividends for a reliable stream of income—not billionaire hedge funds.\\nOlder, middle-class Californians will lose their investments, and the cost of energy will necessarily skyrocket.\\nAdd it all up, and the future of the Golden State is looking quite dark.\\nCalifornia already has some of the highest gasoline prices in the nation, an absurd cost of living and housing (which has driven many to flee to the rural areas with high fire risks), exploding homelessness and crime, and a one-party political system that offers no real alternatives.\\nEven the concept of citizenship is breaking down, with absurd laws now allowing illegal immigrants serve on government boards and commissions, leaving little reason for many to be invested in the state’s future.\\nWith this additional blow during fire season—which is crushing businesses, and making many Californians feel like they are living in a Third World country—there will be even more pressure on the middle class to pull up stakes and leave.\\nThat’s hardly a good sign for a sustainable future.\\n“The state’s elite took revolving-door entries and exits for granted,” wrote historian Victor Davis Hanson, a California native. “They assumed that California was so naturally rich, beautiful, and well-endowed that there would always be thousands of newcomers who would queue up for the weather, the shore, the mountains, and the hip culture.”\\nBut now California “is nearing the logical limits of progressive adventurism in policy and politics,” Hanson wrote.\\nEventually, what’s lost won’t be replaced.\\nCalifornia, a state that once set the standards for prosperity and the American dream for the rest of the country, will be little more than a dire warning of how economic blessings can be squandered in a generation.',\n",

Not only is this trend wildly misguided—how destroying statues and paintings bring an end to racism and prejudice is never fully explained—but it also cheapens the debate over America’s past by ignoring nuance.\\nFrom the beginning, it was clear that this movement had far less to do with genuinely criticizing past historical figures, but instead reflected the need of modern radicals to feel good about themselves and think they are “doing something” to stop oppression, be it real or imaginary.\\nReflection and thoughtfulness are uncomfortable impediments to those who never dare question whether they are on the “right side of history.”\\nIt makes sense that the same people who seek to de-platform individuals for wrongthink on social media and shut down controversial speakers at universities are the same people who want to erase artwork and monuments. The common thread is for their views to be constantly reinforced and never challenged from without.\\nThe unthinking maxims of intersectionality and identity politics must be recited over and over again from all sectors of society. No alternate views can be tolerated. Such teachings soothe the minds of radicals who can easily ignore the moral complications of life from the safe comforts of their college campuses and public buildings. (Those, of course, are made possible by the wicked people they seek to extinguish.)\\nDoubt, skepticism, and the use of reason are uncomfortable and problematic.\\nIt didn’t take long for the iconoclasts to move from Jefferson Davis to Thomas Jefferson, and then from Jefferson to the most revered of our Founding Fathers, George Washington.\\nWhat’s truly revealing about the empty, surface-level nature of these efforts is how little cost is involved for those doing the erasing.\\nCriticizing slavery and racism in 2019 can get one tenure, public office, and a six-figure salary as a corporate consultant. So brave.\\nIt’s easy to cover up or take down a painting, not so easy to sacrifice the immense benefits of living in the prosperous constitutional republic that problematic men like Washington created.\\nAs David Marcus wrote for The Federalist, it was easy to get rid of Kate Smith’s “God Bless America” recording at Yankee games due to her singing what are now considered offensive songs in the 1930s—but are Yankee fans willing to abolish the Yankees themselves because of their team’s historical role in segregation?\\nFor that matter, are Harvard University administrators and professors willing to give up their jobs at an institution founded in part by a man who owned slaves because its origin was problematic?\\nNot likely.\\nIt’s far more satisfying to take the less costly step of tearing down a painting or a statue. And it’s much easier to avoid the complicated fact that so many of these supposedly ignorant and prejudiced people built the very institutions they enjoy today.\\nIn their simplistic thinking, surely those who founded a free republic based on consent, and truly “broke the wheel” of tyranny that had been the norm for virtually all of human history, couldn’t be great if slavery was still a part of their heritage.\\nThey failed to live up to their own ideals, so they best be erased.\\nBut to follow this logic forward, we can’t stop with the Founders.\\nThe over half-million Americans who lost their lives and countless others who risked them to end slavery, the “original sin” of this country, also weren’t so great, you see.\\nTheir skin was generally too fair, their motivations insufficiently pure, and most were undoubtedly homophobes who couldn’t have conceived of modern concepts like gay marriage or a man literally becoming a woman.\\nHow can men like President William McKinley, who could simply be attacked for other reasons, be celebrated?\\nThey can’t. They too must be obliterated.\\nGreatness, according to the history erasers, truly belongs to the wokescolds who wage hashtag campaigns to raise awareness about offensive art and ensure society conforms to their ever-evolving whims.\\nBut the truth is, those who wage war on America’s history are tacitly acknowledging the benefits of living in America, a free country that allows them to pursue their radical activism, even though it is antithetical to the founding ideals that enable free speech.\\nThese movements are forcing politics to infect every corner of our existence, and that weakens this country. It makes us more hateful toward one another and trains us in the un-American notion that to win arguments, we must quash, liquidate, and erase from all memory those we disagree with.\\nThe Washington mural may come down in San Francisco, but the real damage is not being done to the art. It’s being done to the legacy of Washington, to ourselves.\\nThe past is an easy target for iconoclast bullies, but if Americans don’t want them to keep winning, they will have to begin standing up and speaking out against them.\\nIf not, the destruction of our statues and artwork will merely be symbolic of the destruction done to our country at large.',\n",
       " 'Rapper Jay-Z remarked that fatherless homes cause boys to rebel. (Photo: Shareif Ziyadat/Getty Images)\\nHip-hop mogul Jay-Z is drawing belated condemnation on Twitter for attributing “adverse feeling for authority” to fatherless households during a panel discussion on social justice earlier this year.\\nVideos of the rapper—whose given name is Shawn—discussing single-parent households on a race-relations panel recently surfaced and went viral.\\nIn the clip from the January discussion, Jay-Z, 49, remarked that fatherless homes cause boys to rebel against the police and “people to lose lives” when interacting with police.\\n“You think about the idea of growing up in a single-parent house, which I grew up in … and having an adverse feeling for authority,” said Jay-Z, the first billionaire hip-hop artist and entrepreneur.\\n“Your father’s gone, so you’re like, ‘I hate my dad. Don’t nobody tell me what to do,” he said. “I’m the man of the house. And then you hit the street, and you run into a police officer, and his first thing is ‘Put your hands up, freeze, shut up … you like … F— you!’”\\nHe added, “That interaction causes people to lose lives.”\\nJay-Z’s comments stirred controversy in the face of claims of police brutality against unarmed black men that have spawned national protests and the Black Lives Matter movement, an advocacy group that lobbies for criminal justice reform.\\nSeveral Twitter users fired back at Jay-Z, calling his statement “false” and accusing him of “blaming” black people for police brutality.\\nThe rapper hasn’t responded to the criticism he’s received for his remarks.\\nAnother clip of Jay-Z, in the same panel discussion, shows him saying, “We don’t want the people [who are] in charge of the police areas to be in danger, either. We want to be very clear, you know: If someone commits a crime, they should go to jail.”\\nHe also said the broken family structure “affects everyone,” including “hardworking taxpayers” and “police officer families.”\\nThe panel discussion took place Jan. 23 at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City, where the creation of a new criminal justice organization called the Reform Alliance was announced. The aim of the initiative is to remove “one million people from the criminal justice system within five years.” CNN commentator Van Jones, an adviser to then-President Barack Obama, was named as its CEO.\\nOther panelists included rapper Meek Mill and New England Patriots NFL football team owner Robert Kraft, along with Michael Rubin and Clara Wu Tsai, the co-owners of the Philadelphia 76ers and Brooklyn Nets NBA basketball teams, respectively.\\nNo stranger to controversy, Jay-Z also drew criticism recently for excluding outspoken former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick from his social justice partnership with the league, which was announced on Aug. 13.\\nJay-Z is not the only rapper to draw a backlash for raising the problem of single-parent households. Rapper Kanye West, a past frequent collaborator with Jay-Z, addressed fatherless homes and has openly supported President Donald Trump.\\nDuring a rant on “Saturday Night Live” on Oct. 5, 2018, West said, “The blacks want always Democrats … you know, it’s like the plan they did, to take the fathers out the home and put them on welfare … . Does anybody know about that? That’s a Democratic plan.”\\nWest also received criticism on Twitter for his support of Trump.',\n",
       " 'NAACP chapters in California appear to agree with Education Secretary Betsy DeVos that charter schools offer valuable opportunities to black students. Pictured: DeVos testifies March 28 during a Senate subcommittee hearing. (Photo: Zach Gibson/Getty Images)\\nThe NAACP’s support for a moratorium on new charter schools across America has put the nation’s oldest civil rights group at odds with three of its local branches—and in California, of all places.\\xa0 \\nNot only that, but the local NAACP chapters appear to agree with Education Secretary Betsy DeVos that charter schools offer valuable opportunities to black students.\\nDeVos, a longtime school choice advocate who some on the left paint as anti-minority, says the NAACP’s adoption of a charter school moratorium three years ago doesn’t reflect the views of black parents and students she has spoken with. \\n“There’s a disconnect between the leadership of the national [NAACP] organization and some of the local chapters … and parents and students,” DeVos said in a recent interview with LA School Report. “I think there is a clear disconnect.”\\xa0\\nThe San Diego, Southwest Riverside, and San Bernardino NAACP branches of the California Hawaii NAACP cover territory that holds California’s largest population of black students.\\xa0\\nAll three branches submitted resolutions to the state NAACP’s board opposing the national organization’s 2016 ratification of a resolution calling for a moratorium on charter school expansion.\\xa0\\nThe NAACP’s Position\\nThe NAACP resolution called for a moratorium on charter school expansion until:\\xa0\\n—Charter schools are subject to the same transparency and accountability standards as public schools. \\n —Public funds are not diverted to charter schools at the expense of the public school system.  —Charter schools cease expelling students that public schools have a duty to educate.\\xa0  —Charter schools cease to perpetuate de facto segregation of the highest performing children from those whose aspirations may be high but whose talents are not yet as obvious. \\nSome local NAACP branches, however, offered their own resolutions to end the moratorium on opening new charter schools.\\n“We’re hopeful that it can be adopted in California, and then the national board will do their research and investigate the facts in order to look at this again from the perspective of what is really going on with the African American students locally, statewide, and nationally,” said Christina Laster, education chairwoman for the NAACP’s Southwest Riverside branch.\\nUnder NAACP rules, a local branch can submit a resolution when it disagrees with the national board. The national board will review the resolution before the group’s annual convention, but all branches ultimately must abide by policies set from the top.\\n‘Breaking Ranks’\\n“It sounds like NAACP branches are breaking ranks with the California state NAACP and national board,” Myrna Castrejón, president and CEO of the California Charter Schools Association, told LA School Report.\\xa0\\n“Everybody knows black students are the lowest-performing subgroup, other than students with special needs, and the system has done nothing to provide targeted support,” Castrejón said.\\nAccording to the San Diego NAACP branch’s resolution, African American student groups have a “severe and persistent” achievement gap throughout the state in math and English language arts.\\xa0\\nThe resolution also notes how well African American students are performing in charter schools compared to traditional public schools. Only 10 public schools in California with a majority African American student enrollment fall in the top half of student performance statewide in English and math, according to the resolution, but eight of the 10 are public charter schools.\\n“I think they’re totally mistaken,” DeVos said about supporters of a charter school moratorium in California in the LA School Report interview, “and they’re not really acting or speaking in the best interests of those they profess to represent.”\\xa0\\nThe secretary of education said that one need only talk to a student who has benefited from school choice to understand her point of view.\\xa0\\nThe California Hawaii NAACP has called for the three local branches to “rescind their position because it conflicts with the state branch position” as led by its education chairman, Julian Vasquez Heilig.\\xa0\\nNo Standing?\\n“I don’t think anybody would characterize Betsy DeVos as a civil rights leader,” Vasquez Heilig said in a phone interview Monday with The Daily Signal. “I just don’t think she really has any standing in this conversation.”\\nVasquez Heilig has been at the forefront of the national NAACP board’s push for charter school restrictions in California as a professor of educational leadership at California State University, Sacramento. In early June, he was named dean of the University of Kentucky College of Education and was expected to take that post this month.\\xa0\\xa0\\nVasquez Heilig told The Daily Signal that charter schools in California lack accountability and transparency.\\xa0\\n“We haven’t made any modifications to the California charter school law in decades,” he said.\\xa0\\nBut Brittany Chord Parmley, a spokeswoman for the California Charter School Association, sharply criticized the national NAACP’s education chairman.\\n“Julian Vasquez Heilig hacked the NAACP to serve his own anti-charter political agenda,” Parmley told The Daily Signal in an email. “Shame on him for exploiting a trusted civil rights organization to trap black kids in failing schools and deny black parents the right to choose where their children go to school.”\\n“Everybody knows black kids are being massively failed by the public school system,” she added. “It’s ironic that Dr. Heilig would try and shut down those within the NAACP who support public charter schools from using the same resolution process he used himself to call for a moratorium. Sure doesn’t sound very democratic.” \\nVasquez Heilig brushed off such criticism, saying:\\nI think everybody is very aware that while the California Charter School Association will tell anybody who will listen to them that they’re in favor of transparency and accountability for charter schools, behind the scenes, they’re spending tens of millions of dollars and working hard to make sure that does not happen.\\nLegislation in Play\\nCalifornia lawmakers in May withdrew two bills that would have threatened the growth of charter schools: Assembly Bill 1506, which sought to cap that growth, and Senate Bill 756, which would have imposed a two-year moratorium on charter schools.\\xa0\\nThe bills were part of a package of four measures to restrict charter schools, first introduced in February by Assemblyman Patrick O’Donnell, D-Long Beach, chairman of the Assembly Education Committee.\\xa0\\nO’Donnell said the bills would ensure officials “make responsible and informed decisions” and would be “critical for student success and taxpayer accountability.”\\xa0\\nVasquez Heilig supported the two remaining bills, Assembly Bill 1505 and Assembly Bill 1507, which the lower chamber passed in May and sent to the state Senate.\\xa0\\nAB 1505 would give local school districts exclusive authority to approve new charter schools. The bill also would allow districts to assess a proposed charter school’s budget impact during that approval process, and rescind existing law that gives charter school officials the right to appeal a denial.\\xa0\\nVasquez Heilig has said the measure is “commonsense transparency and accountability, and has a really good shot in the state Senate.”\\nThe second remaining bill, AB 1507, would amend current law to prohibit a charter school from being located outside district boundaries when organizers can’t otherwise find a facility. Critics say such situations create budget costs for the adopted district.\\xa0\\nBoth bills are endorsed by the California Teachers Association as well as the California Hawaii NAACP.\\xa0',\n",

Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., said the Detroit Police Department should hire only black people to analyze photos of criminal suspects in the department’s facial recognition system. \\nDuring a recent visit to the police department, the first-term lawmaker said that “analysts need to be African Americans, not people that are not.”\\xa0\\n“I think non-African Americans think African Americans all look the same,” said Tlaib, who is Palestinian. \\nDetroit’s population is nearly 80% black, according to the Census Bureau.\\xa0\\nDetroit Police Chief James Craig, who is black, defended the professionalism of the analysts who use the facial recognition system. Craig added that if he had said what Tlaib said, people\\xa0would be outraged and “they would be calling for my resignation.”\\xa0\\nTlaib toured the facility Oct. 3. Craig had invited her to do so after remarks she made Aug. 20 in a tweet criticizing the technology, saying “@detroitpolice You should probably rethink this whole facial-recognition bull—-.”\\nFollowing that remark, Craig invited Tlaib, who represents parts of Detroit and some of its suburbs, to the Real Time Crime Center to see how the facial recognition technology and the analysts work.\\nTlaib toured the center, which monitors live footage from video cameras on traffic lights, businesses, and elsewhere around the city. Craig and facial recognition analysts showed Tlaib the software used to identify suspects in crimes.\\xa0\\nFacial recognition technology identifies people from live or recorded video or photos, and it compares a person’s facial features with those in a database of photographs of faces or official mugshots.\\xa0\\nThe tour, which lasted more than an hour, prompted some contention between Craig and Tlaib over the software, and particularly whether only blacks should work in the crime center to analyze photos flagged by the software.\\xa0\\n“I’ve seen it even on the House floor: People calling Elijah Cummings ‘John Lewis,’ and John Lewis ‘Elijah Cummings,’ and they’re totally different people,” Tlaib said. “I see it all the time, and I love them because they go along with it.” \\nCummings and Lewis are bald, black Democratic congressmen from Maryland and Georgia, respectively.\\xa0\\nCraig took issue with Tlaib’s assertion. \\n“I trust people who are trained, regardless of race, regardless of gender. It’s about the training,” he said.\\nFollowing Thursday’s tour, though, Tlaib told Detroit’s WDIV-TV: “This is me protecting my residents. My residents asked me to do my job, and my job is to make sure they’re not going to be misidentified, or detained, or falsely arrested because he’s using broken technology.”\\nCraig said, also on WDIV-TV, that Tlaib’s comments were “insulting” toward the white analysts on his staff.\\nCraig spoke of a conversation he had with the vice president of the Detroit Police Officers Association union, Ronald Thomas, who the chief said was “infuriated.” \\nCraig quoted Thomas as saying: “We would rather that [Tlaib] fight for us, to get us more money, or more jobs.”\\nThe chief added of the union, “And they said, you know, their support for her is in question at this point.”\\nTlaib isn’t backing down, however. \\n“I stand behind my comments that facial recognition technology is broken and that relying on an analyst that might not be reflective of the suspect is flawed in itself as well,” she said. \\nIn 2017, the Detroit City Council approved $1 million in funding to purchase the facial recognition software from DataWorks Plus, a company based in Greenville, South Carolina. \\nThe Detroit Board of Police Commissioners on Sept. 19 approved policies governing use of the technology after some criticism from skeptics.\\nAlthough the facial recognition technology would assist law enforcement in solving crimes, critics have raised violation of privacy as an issue.\\xa0\\nIn California, state lawmakers passed a bill that would impose a three-year moratorium on use of facial recognition technology on police bodycams.

(Photo: Klaus Vedfelt/Getty Images)\\n\\nJude Schwalbach\\n\\nJude Schwalbach is a research assistant in education policy at The Heritage Foundation.\\nParents look for many things in a school: strong academics,\\nengaging extracurricular activities, and quality teachers who offer one-on-one\\nhelp to their kids. \\nBut increasingly, parents are adding safety to their list:\\nThey want a school where their children will feel safe. \\nSafety is a growing concern for parents. A 2017\\nGallup Survey found that three in 10 parents are concerned for their\\nchildren’s safety at school. And it’s no wonder, given what kids are\\nexperiencing.\\nIn the District of Columbia, more than 30% of middle school\\nstudents reported\\xa0being\\nbullied\\xa0at school, nearly 10% of high school students say they were threatened\\nor injured\\xa0with a weapon on school property, and more than 15%\\nexperienced\\xa0physical\\nfights\\xa0on school property. \\nAnother 10% said they missed\\nschool because they felt unsafe at school or during their commute.\\nIt’s no surprise that parents, such as those surveyed in Florida\\nand Indiana,\\nranked school safety as one of the top three most important school\\ncharacteristics. \\nAnd when parents grow concerned, policymakers begin to take\\nnote. \\nLast year, Rep. Jim Banks, R-Ind., proposed a bill introducing child safety accounts. These accounts would help D.C. children who are the victims of bullying, sexual harassment, or violence to pay for tuition, tutoring, books, transportation, and therapy so that they could move to another school. \\nSince D.C. is under the jurisdiction of Congress, these accounts\\nare an appropriate federal measure. \\nThis proposal would build on existing school choice options\\nin Washington, D.C., including the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program, which\\nprovides vouchers to children from low-income families to attend a private\\nschool of choice. \\nThe D.C. proposal takes a cue from Florida, where the Hope\\nScholarship Program allows students who are bullied or the victims of\\nphysical attacks to transfer to a school of their choice. \\nCharter schools are another solution for parents looking for\\nsafe schools. \\nIt’s well known that charter schools don’t have the same safety\\nproblems that traditional public schools have. One recent study\\nfound that charter schools were much more likely to report that certain safety\\nproblems, such as students abusing teachers and gang activities, “never occurred.”\\nIn Denver, researchers found that school safety was third\\namong 18 factors that parents considered when applying to the city’s charter\\nschools. Likewise, in Pennsylvania, teachers ranked safety as the fourth\\nmost important reason (out of 10) for seeking employment at a charter\\nschool. \\nParents want their children to learn and grow in safe school\\nenvironments. The expansion of charter schools, education savings accounts, and\\nother school choice options means giving power to parents to choose schools\\nthat are the right fit for their children.\\nConsistent with Robert Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, parents\\nwill prioritize school safety over other school characteristics like academic\\nachievement. As Milton Friedman noted in his book “Free\\nto Choose,” “Parents generally have both\\ngreater interest in their children’s schooling and more intimate knowledge of\\ntheir capacities and needs than anyone else.” \\nNational School Choice Week is an opportunity for policymakers\\nto trust to families to make the best choices for their children’s’ educations.',\n",

Marilyn Wiggins, a volunteer at the TraRon\\nCenter, recalled her grandson struggling in the aftermath of the shooting. \\n“Last week, he came and said, ‘I don’t want to die. I’m\\nscared to die,’” Wiggins said.\\nRecognizing the reality of unsafe situations for too\\nmany schoolchildren in Washington, D.C., Rep. Jim Banks, R-Ind., took steps last\\nmonth with a new\\nproposal that provides child-safety accounts to children in\\ndangerous school settings in the nation’s capital. \\nStudents who suffer from bullying, sexual harassment, or\\nviolence could use their child-safety account to pay for tuition at private\\nschools of their choice. Instead of being trapped by their ZIP code, children\\ncould attend schools where they can flourish. \\nThe Independent Institute’s Vicki Alger and Timothy\\nBenson of the Heartland\\nInstitute noted the helplessness many low-income families face\\nwhen their local public school is unsafe. \\n“Unless parents can afford to send their children to a\\nprivate school or home-school them, their child’s fate is often at the whim of\\ncircumstance and an entrenched bureaucracy,” they explain.\\nTragically, the effects of violence are pervasive in\\nmany students’ lives at school and in the surrounding D.C. neighborhoods. \\nEven the schoolhouse—long idealized as a refuge for\\nchildren—struggles to provide solace and sanctuary.\\nFor instance, more than 30 percent of D.C. middle-school\\nstudents reported being\\nbullied at school. Among D.C. high-school students, nearly 10\\npercent were threatened\\nor injured with a weapon on school property, and more than 15\\npercent of high school students experienced physical\\nfights on school property. \\nIn light of their toxic environments, 10\\npercent of high-school students reported skipping school\\nin the prior 30 days because they felt unsafe at school or on their way to\\nschool. \\nAll children deserve an education in a safe and effective\\nlearning environment, and the fact that so many children feel unsafe in the\\nnation’s capital should be a priority for Congress, since Washington, D.C., is\\nthe only the school district under\\ncongressional authority. \\nBanks’ child-safety accounts take ownership of Congress’\\nspecial relationship with education in Washington, D.C., and seek to ameliorate\\nthe circumstances of children in unsafe schools. \\nIn addition, families would be able to use new D.C. tax-credit\\nscholarships to “top off” their child-safety accounts\\nfor additional expenses. For instance, these scholarships can make the\\ndifference in private-school tuition, pay for textbooks, tutoring, college\\ncourses, and therapy to cope with trauma.\\nBanks also has introduced a proposal to provide education savings accounts to another group of students that Congress has authority to extend education choice to; namely, students of active-duty military families.  \\nA safe school environment is one\\nof the top three factors for parents when choosing a school, as\\na recent study by The Heritage Foundation’s Lindsey Burke and EdChoice’s Jason\\nBedrick showed. \\nAnd the Independent Institute’s Alger noted parents’\\nrapidly growing fears about school safety. She\\nwrote, “Today, one in three parents are fearful about their\\nchild’s physical safety at school—up significantly since 2013, when just over\\none in 10 parents expressed such fear.” \\nCongress has long recognized its special responsibility\\nto the children of Washington, D.C., which is one of the most notorious\\nschool districts in the nation. \\nIn 2003, the life-changing D.C. Opportunity Scholarship\\nProgram was established, providing 1,600 children a year in the District with a\\nvoucher to attend a safe and effective school.\\nThe best way to answer the clamors of parents and\\nstudents for safe schools is to empower them with choice. Expanding choice to\\nstudents through child-safety accounts is an important policy step in the right\\ndirection to accomplish that goal. ',\n",
       " 'Moral instruction in schools is extremely important to families. Parents rank moral and character development as one of the top three most important qualities in a school. (Photo: Getty Images)\\n\\nJude Schwalbach\\n\\nJude Schwalbach is a research assistant in education policy at The Heritage Foundation.\\nLouisville, Kentucky, public school teacher Paul Barnwell was distressed by his 11th-grade students’ response to this hypothetical moral quandary: “If your significant other commits a felony where people are gravely injured, do you report them to the police?” \\nTo his dismay, the students resoundingly responded “No!” \\nHis students’ reaction made Barnwell recognize the\\nabsence of moral instruction and character development in district schools. \\nIn fact, he argued that moral instruction is often\\nneglected, since many teachers are overwhelmed by the pressures to focus\\ninstruction on government-assessed standards, such as Common Core, which\\nhe notes “ultimately elevated\\nstandardized testing and severely narrowed curricula.” \\n“For many American students who have attended a public\\nschool at some point since 2002, standardized-test preparation and narrowly\\ndefined academic success [have] been the unstated, but de facto, purpose of\\ntheir schooling experience,” Barnwell wrote in The\\nAtlantic. \\nYet moral instruction in schools is extremely important\\nto families. In particular, parents rank moral and character development as one\\nof the top three most\\nimportant qualities in a school.\\nThe omission of moral instruction in many public schools\\ncuts against the grain of families who want their children to grow into good\\npeople, not just positive test scores. Families see schools as their partners who\\nhelp prepare children for civic participation. \\n“[C]ommunities and educational institutions that prepare\\nstudents to live out their duties beyond the civic horizon are the essential\\nsubstance, the lifeblood, of the American constitutional tradition and American\\ncivic life,” explains Ethics and Public Policy fellow Ian Lindquist in National\\nAffairs.\\nUnfortunately, too many educators are unwilling or\\nunable to engage their students in discussions about ethics. \\nBarnwell,\\nnoting the lament of Steve Ellenwood, the director of Boston University’s\\nCenter for Character and Social Responsibility, remarked, “Many educators\\n‘blithely accept that schools must be value-neutral.’” \\nFrustrated with district school homogeneity, families turned to school choice options to fill the void created by district schools’ retreat from moral instruction.\\nCharter schools have provided a unique education alternative\\nbecause they often have greater curricular autonomy and operate with less\\nfunding. \\nFor instance, dissatisfied Arizona families formed a charter school that emphasized ethics and character development. During the next two decades, their school model expanded into the Great Hearts Academy charter school network, which spans Arizona and Texas and teaches 18,000 students annually.\\nGreat Hearts charter schools, while not religious institutions, developed their own curriculum that emphasizes strong moral instruction. Lindquist noted, “[These] schools are still guided by something they view as transcendent—[human nature], which contains powers that can be cultivated and directed toward excellence or virtue.”\\nAccordingly, students engage in thoughtful conversations\\nabout justice, civic virtue, and personal responsibility. “Character education\\nis not old-fashioned, and it’s not about bringing religion into the classroom.\\nCharacter education teaches children how to make wise decisions and act on them,”\\nsays English teacher\\xa0Jessica\\nLahey.\\nThe quick expansion of Great Hearts and institutions\\nlike it illustrates how much families value their children’s character\\ndevelopment. Parents are not willing to sacrifice “the\\nhumanity of students for potential academic and intellectual\\ngain” alone. \\nIt’s important to note that these changes occurred because parents were empowered with education choices and seized the initiative to implement change. \\nIn “The\\nNot-So-Great Society,” Robert Jackson, chief academic officer for\\nGreat Hearts, added: “Classical charter schools are being driven by families,\\nteachers, and policymakers who value schools founded on the academic and moral\\nqualities that are essential for sustaining communities.” \\nCharter school autonomy allows school leaders and\\nteachers to create innovative curricula that meets the needs of families. Unlike\\nbehemoth district schools, which are weighed down by bureaucratic regulations\\nand mandates, charter schools have the agility to grapple with difficult\\nphilosophical and moral questions, an exercise that can imbue students with the\\nintellectual tools and character development required of productive members of\\na free society. \\nAs University of Arkansas professor Jay\\nGreene explains, educational\\nendeavors that focus on local communities succeed, where attempts to reform mammoth\\nschool systems through heavy-handed top-down government approaches have\\nrepeatedly failed.\\n“A wiser approach is to allow families and communities\\nto make their own choices about the purpose of education,” Greene wrote. “Doing\\nso would be more consistent with Americans’ general inclination toward\\nrespecting the liberty of others.” \\nGreene’s assessment resonates with Lindquist’s\\nsuggestion that schools and families “are best understood in terms\\nof generations and centuries, not election and funding cycles.” Parents play an\\nessential role in school success and should be welcomed as educational\\npartners.\\nAll parents want their children to grow into healthy\\nmembers of society, suggesting a demand for schools that emphasize character\\ndevelopment and civics. Accordingly, policymakers should allow families to form\\nthe schools that reflect their community values.\\nThe success of charter schools such as Great Hearts shows\\nthat there is considerable demand for classical, values-based instruction.\\nEnabling schools of choice to flourish can meet that demand.',\n",
       " \"School choice has found success in the nation's capital through the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program. (Photo: \\nKazunori Nagashima/Getty images)\\n\\nJude Schwalbach\\n\\nJude Schwalbach is a research assistant in education policy at The Heritage Foundation.\\nFamilies in the nation’s capital deserve a choice about educating\\ntheir children.\\nThis year, Congress has the chance to make changes to the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program—up for reauthorization—that could positively affect the future of D.C. children for decades to come. \\nThe D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program provides scholarships\\nto cover private school tuition for low-income children in the nation’s capital.\\xa0 \\nThe scholarship program has been a major success for participating students. Scholarship recipients have a chance to learn in safe environments, escaping dangerous schools, sexual harassment, and bullying. \\nScholarship students are performing as well as their public school counterparts on tests of academic achievement for one-third of the cost. And they are graduating at a rate of an estimated 21 percentage points higher than their peers who applied for, but did not receive, a scholarship. \\nYet opponents of school choice argue that greater educational choice is unnecessary since there are excess seats in D.C. Public Schools. \\nAccording to The Washington Post, Washington’s deputy mayor of education, Paul Kihn, said, “The city has more than 5,000 empty high school seats and more than 3,600 available middle school slots” in public schools.\\nThe empty seats, however, are the result of parents\\nlooking for an alternative to the traditional public school system. \\nIn fact, 3,294\\nnew and returning students applied for an opportunity\\nscholarship this school year, for 1,645 available spaces in the program. To\\ndate, 24,351 students have applied for a scholarship through the Opportunity\\nScholarship Program, and 10,701 available scholarships have been provided since\\nit launched in 2004. \\xa0\\nIn addition to many more families applying to the Opportunity\\nScholarship Program than available vouchers, there are more than 11,861 children on\\nthe charter school wait list in the District. It’s a\\nclear sign that families want options.\\nParents are understandably seeking out better educational options for their children. Just 2 in 10 eighth-grade students in D.C. Public Schools are proficient in reading or math, as shown on the National Assessment of Educational Progress. \\nUnsurprisingly, in 2017, the District of Columbia had the second-lowest attainment rate nationwide with only 73% of seniors graduating. But last year, District of Columbia attainment rates plummeted to 68.5% after an Office of the State Superintendent of Education report found that schools failed to properly report pervasive truancy. \\nPerhaps even more concerning, District of Columbia public schools are dangerous. Children regularly self-reported skipping school because they felt unsafe. Their absences are understandable as 30% report being bullied at school, and 1 in 10 report being threatened with a weapon or injured on school property. \\nAnd political elites know the perils of D.C Public\\nSchools. \\nIn fact, Jimmy Carter was the only president in office to enroll his child in a D.C. public school in the last century. \\nNo one should begrudge a president for choosing the best school for his child, but good education and healthy learning environments should be available to all children, not just those whose parents can afford to pay twice: once in taxes for the public system and a second time to pay private school tuition. \\nAs Patrick\\nWolf,\\na professor of education at the University of Arkansas, said, “When it comes to\\neducation, how far you go matters more in life than how much you know, so\\neducational attainment is the best measure of the effectiveness of a choice\\nprogram.” \\nEducation choice in the District is delivering on that\\nscore.\\nWolf’s comment supports work done by Ron Haskins, Elizabeth\\nSawhill, and Brad Wilcox on the success sequence. Haskins\\nfound that individuals who “finish high school, get a\\nfull-time job, and wait until age 21 to get married and have children” are far\\nmore likely to join the middle class.\\nBrookings’ Richard Reeves\\nnotes that one factor preventing greater success among\\nminority children is the fact that they “attend worse schools, in part because\\nlocal tax and property laws prevent their parents from moving to neighborhoods\\nwith better schools.”\\nThe D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program, however, breaks\\ndown this barrier that would otherwise bar many low-income and minority\\nchildren from better education by breaking the link between housing and\\nschooling. \\nSo what should the next steps be for the successful\\nD.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program? As my colleague Lindsey Burke suggests:\\nAnd the 11,861 children on the charter school waitlist\\nshould be made eligible for a D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program voucher in\\nthe future. Such an expansion would create massive new educational opportunity\\nfor D.C. families.\",\n",
       " 'Two means of certifying schoolteachers have diverged in California and Arizona. (Photo: Brittany Murray/MediaNews Group/Long Beach Press-Telegram/Getty Images)\\n\\nJude Schwalbach\\n\\nJude Schwalbach is a research assistant in education policy at The Heritage Foundation.\\n“Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, / and sorry I could not travel both. / And be one traveler, long I stood / And looked down one as far as I could,” poet Robert Frost wrote in “The Road Not Taken.” \\nAs with\\nFrost’s path, two means of certifying schoolteachers have also diverged in\\nCalifornia and Arizona, and one path—the one less taken in most states—is\\nproving to better serve its teacher and student travelers. \\nState\\npolicies governing teacher certification can have a considerable effect on the\\neducational options to which families have access. \\nFor example, while families in Arizona enjoy a robust and diverse charter school system, parents in the California, on the other hand, are watching government policies suffocate a popular charter school sector, doing so through numerous regulations, including regulations on the teacher workforce.\\nThis summer,\\nCalifornia policymakers reached a deal that could hamper charter schools’\\nability to provide unique learning environments. The proposal would require all\\ncharter school teachers to obtain the same credentials as district school\\nteachers. \\nThat would\\nfundamentally undermine charter school autonomy in one of the areas most\\nimportant to charter school leaders; namely, who teaches in their classrooms. \\nCalifornia already compels charter schools to hire teachers with “a\\nstate-approved credential in all core academic subjects, including English\\nlanguage arts, math, science, and social studies.” The new regulations would also\\nrequire those who teach electives, such as music and art, to obtain\\nstate-approved credentials.\\nThese certifications will cost physical education and music teachers nearly $300, while art teachers will have to pay more than $260. Those costs do not include the time, energy, and transportation teachers will expend to acquire the state-mandated credentials. \\nInnovative charter schools are popular with Californians as they enroll about 10% of students. Their popularity increased dramatically in the past decade, which saw enrollment increase by 150%.\\nOpponents of\\ncharter schools claim that state-mandated teacher credentials are needed to\\nensure school quality. Such regulations, however, would vastly limit the pool\\nof potential teachers, because credentialing is a lengthy and burdensome\\nprocess—which research suggests provides limited, if any, value. \\nResearch\\nfrom the Brookings Institution, for example, shows that there is no\\ndifference between teachers who are traditionally certified, alternatively\\ncertified, or not certified at all.\\nSource:\\nBrookings Institution\\nCompulsory\\ncertification also means highly qualified professionals with subject-matter\\nexpertise and experience will be barred from bringing their skills to the\\nclassroom, absent a government seal of approval. \\nPeople like Microsoft’s Bill Gates, cellist Yo-Yo Ma, and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice could not teach in their respective fields of computer science, music, or political science without state certification.\\nThe waters\\nare further muddied since the new skills-based credentials are often conflated with\\nCalifornia’s Certificate of Clearance, which guarantees that prospective\\nteachers receive the necessary background checks to ensure student safety. \\nAt the end\\nof the day, state-required teacher credentialing is a win for teachers unions.\\nBy creating more barriers to the teaching profession, the jobs of unionized\\nteachers in district schools are artificially protected from charter school\\ncompetition. \\nAs education policy specialist Mike McShane commented in Forbes, “Large, wealthy, incumbent actors can actually start to influence the ways legislation or regulations are written in order to stifle their competition. Traditional teacher preparation programs can lobby states to write regulations that make alternative certification paths more difficult.” \\nCalifornia’s proposed teacher certification regulations are a clear instance of regulatory capture and aim to strangle charter competition.\\nInstead of\\nallowing special-interest groups to drive policy about the personnel decisions\\nmade in local schools, policymakers should follow the lead of Arizona, enabling\\nschool leaders to determine the people and practices that will best serve\\nstudents in the state.\\xa0 \\nArizona does not require state certification of charter school teachers, allowing school principals to make hiring decisions independently. Arizona charter schools must specify their teacher qualifications in their charter applications and keep employee resumes and employment histories on hand for parents or anyone else at all times. \\nMoreover, Arizona’s policy is complemented by a charter school system that enables families to drive accountability in the sector. Nearly 20% of Arizona students are enrolled in charter schools. \\nAs researcher Matt Ladner noted in Education Next, “When parents don’t like a school, they can simply vote with their feet, either by withdrawing their children from the school or by not choosing it in the first place. It is, therefore, parents, rather than state officials, who play the primary role in holding Arizona charter schools accountable, in a highly efficient manner.”\\nWhile\\ncharter schools are awarded 15-year authorizations in Arizona, most\\nunderperforming charter schools closed within four years of opening because\\ndissatisfied families left for better schools. \\nAttrition,\\ndriven by families leaving due to dissatisfaction, as Ladner explains, creates\\nstrong accountability that shutters underperforming schools before state\\nofficials do.\\nArizona’s\\nfree and open education market forces schools to respond to families and orient\\ntheir services toward family needs. \\nGreat Hearts\\nAcademy in Arizona is a superb example of the unique niche charter schools\\nfill. There, teachers lead students in Socratic Method Seminars (roundtable\\ndiscussions) and cultivate virtue in students—one of the most important qualities parents seek in their children’s\\nschools.\\nThe fruits of Arizona charter school innovation were illustrated in the 2015 National Assessment of Educational Progress results, in which fourth- and eighth-graders in charter schools consistently outperformed their district school peers in math and reading. \\nIn fact, these charter schools, unlike their district school peers, consistently approximated the national assessment performance of students in Massachusetts, who routinely perform at the top of the pack in the nation. \\nSource:\\nMatthew Ladner\\nArizona\\ncharter schools are achieving their success without state-mandated teacher\\ncertification and heavy-handed regulations. \\n“For decades, parents have allowed the $600 billion public education cabal to professionalize them out of the educational equation, basically demanding we shut up, hand our children over, and let the experts do their work,” wrote Education Post CEO Chris Stewart at Project Free Forever. “It hasn’t worked out. Schools today remain mediocre, and education policy offers little hope for systemic change.”\\nPolicymakers\\nin California would do well to trust the decisions of parents.\\n“Two roads diverged in a wood, and I – / I took the one less traveled by, / and that has made all the difference,” Frost wrote in the conclusion of his famous poem. \\nFreedom for parents to choose and freedom for schools to lead is making all the difference in Arizona. It’s time to make the road less traveled—freedom in education—the norm. ',\n",

(Photo: Ricardo Arduengo/AFP/Getty Images)\\n\\nJude Schwalbach\\n\\nJude Schwalbach is a research assistant in education policy at The Heritage Foundation.\\nLast year brought a whirlwind of education opportunities to\\nPuerto Rican families. \\nThe island’s first charter school, Proyecto\\nVimenti, opened to serve disadvantaged children.\\nThe commonwealth’s legislature approved a private\\nschool scholarship program for children who are bullied, experience sexual\\nharassment, or who have special needs. \\nThese were notable victories for families where most have no\\nalternative education options besides the local public schools. \\nUnfortunately, some\\nhave tried to tie recent scandals involving government officials to these\\nisland-wide education reforms. \\nFor instance, former Puerto Rico Secretary of Education\\nJulia Keleher, along with five others, was arrested on federal charges of money\\nlaundering, theft, and wire fraud that steered $15.5\\nmillion to favored, but unqualified, businesses. \\nOnly months later, Gov. Ricardo Rossello resigned in the\\nwake of a volatile 13-day protest instigated by “a massive leak of chats among\\nRossello and his aides in which they disparaged his opponents in profane,\\nsexist language and appeared dismissive of the struggles of ordinary Puerto\\nRicans,” SFGate\\nreported.\\nCorruption is not new to Puerto Rico. In fact, as a recent Heritage Foundation issue brief noted, in 2018, \\xa0that the former Department of Sports and Recreation secretary was cited for “$9.8 million in a ‘kickback, fraud, and money laundering conspiracy’ involving vendors that worked with the territory’s department of education.” \\xa0\\nThe inspector general has reported similar findings to\\nCongress for decades, finding that fraud and corruption are systemic and\\npervasive, including among the teachers\\nunions.\\nWhile politicians, bureaucrats, and lobbyists were embroiled in scandals, the school choice reforms introduced in 2018 have been helping children.\\nFor example, the territory’s second charter school, Rosalina\\nC. Martinez, opened this school year. The school will enroll up to 300\\nmiddle and high school students and aims to specifically strengthen student\\nself-esteem and help children break out of generational cycles of poverty. \\nSince more than 40% of families live below the federal\\npoverty line in Puerto Rico, there are many children who stand to gain from the\\ncharter school’s mission.\\nEven more children will have access to greater education choice next year since the territory plans to double the number of charter schools. Charter school expansion is capped by a law that says only 10% of Puerto Rico’s schools can attend “alianza (charter) schools.”\\nThis year, Puerto Rico is launching a private school tuition scholarship called the Free School Selection Program. Participation numbers have yet to be released, but Andrew Ujifusa, an editor at Education Week, noted, “Voucher enrollment is capped\\xa0at 1% of public school students for the upcoming school year, with the cap eventually rising to 3%.”\\nCharter school and voucher expansion would be a boon to\\nPuerto Rican children, many of whom have no education options besides their\\nlocal public school. Private school is out of reach for most families because\\nof pervasive poverty, and, more recently, the ravages of Hurricane Maria in\\n2017.\\nPuerto Rican children clearly need more education options. The National Assessment of Educational Progress found that fourth- and eighth-graders are five grade levels behind their peers on the mainland in mathematics. \\nMoreover, as of 2017, more than a\\nquarter of Puerto Ricans ages 25 and older did not have a high school\\ndiploma, according to the Census Bureau. \\nHigh school attainment is an important measure of education success. As University of Arkansas professor Patrick Wolf, commented, “When it comes to education, how far you go matters more in life than how much you know.”\\nWolf’s remark is confirmed by Ron Haskins, Elizabeth\\nSawhill, and Brad Wilcox’s research\\non the success sequence, which demonstrates\\nthat those who “finish high school, get a full-time job, and wait until age 21\\nto get married and have children” are far more likely to join the middle class.\\nSchool choice options, such as those in D.C. and Milwaukee,\\nproduced overall positive outcomes for high school attainment. As Puerto Rico’s\\nschool choice programs mature, they will have the opportunity to bear similar\\nfruit.\\xa0 \\nAs things stand, the traditional public schools in Puerto\\nRico have failed to meet the needs of children for decades, resulting in low\\nattainment rates and poor performance on national assessments. \\nIn light of the challenges the territory’s children face,\\nsuch as hurricane recovery and widespread poverty, policymakers should abandon\\nthe policies that have repeatedly failed to enrich the lives of children.\\nInstead, they should grow options that put power back in the hands of parents\\nand give children the education they deserve.

(Photo: George Frey/Getty Images)\\n\\nJude Schwalbach\\n\\nJude Schwalbach is a research assistant in education policy at The Heritage Foundation.\\nMore than a half-century ago, Coretta Scott King addressed Harvard University students in the wake of the assassination of her husband, Martin Luther King Jr. \\nShe said: \\nToday’s student is a serious-minded, independent-thinking individual who seeks to analyze and understand the problems of our society, and find solutions to these problems, which are in keeping with the highest traditions and values of our democratic system. \\nStudents, according to King, were the future of a more\\nthoughtful and equal society, and one of the most important tools at their\\ndisposal was the freedom of speech.\\nYet, today it seems students have changed. \\nFinding solutions to the problems of society remains a\\ndominant feature of modern universities, but many students have rejected the\\nformer spirit that valued solutions, as King noted, “in keeping with the\\nhighest traditions and values of our democratic system.” \\nIn fact, instead of engaging in civil dialogue, students\\nnow express outrage at controversial speakers and demand the resignation of\\nfaculty members who refuse to conform to progressive creeds or do not\\nimmediately condone students’ threatening or pernicious actions. \\nWorse, often they do this with campus administrators in\\ntow.\\nFor instance, a left-leaning professor, Bret Weinstein, at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington, who objected to reverse segregation on campus (specifically, a day when white students and faculty were to remain off campus), was hunted by students in 2017 because of his objection. \\nCampus security, aware of the situation, recommended\\nthat he remain off campus, since they could not protect him as the college\\npresident had ordered security to “stand down.” \\xa0\\nIn 2017, Stanley Kurtz, writing at National Review, \\xa0documented dozens\\nof campus shout-downs across the nation. The presidents of Virginia\\nTech\\nand the University\\nof Oregon were among those shouted down. \\nAfter police removed protesters interrupting Texas state Rep. Briscoe Cain’s speech at Thurgood Marshall School of Law at Texas Southern University, the university president immediately ended the event. He claimed that scheduling procedures weren’t followed, even though the dean of the law school had approved the event. \\nSome argue that such extreme situations result from a\\nvery small, but vocal, group of college students. Most students, instead, choose\\nto remain silent, rather than risk their friendships and social capital—afraid\\nthey might appear “unwoke.” \\nThe trend of student silence is especially evident from\\nthe guarded support Sahil Handa received after publicly critiquing the political\\ntribalization among his fellow Harvard students. \\nHanda wrote that he “received well over a hundred notes from students thanking [him] for writing the article.” \\nBut, he added, “not a single one was shared in public.”\\nThe poignancy of the political atmosphere on college campuses is emphasized by a 2019 Knight Foundation study. It found that “[m]ore than two-thirds (68%) of college students say their campus climate precludes students from expressing their true opinions because their classmates might find it offensive.” \\nAt the same time, the study found that more than half of\\nstudents thought that “shouting down speakers or trying to prevent them from\\ntalking” was either “always” or “sometimes” appropriate.\\nAlthough most students condemned violence as a means to stop a speech or rally, 16% of respondents thought violent actions were acceptable either “always” or “sometimes.”\\nThis general opposition to the free exchange of ideas is fundamentally opposed to an environment of open inquiry. Yale University’s Woodward Report outlines the university’s purpose as “[t]o discover and disseminate knowledge by means of research and teaching. To fulfill this function, a free interchange of ideas is necessary … .” \\nAccordingly, “the university must do everything possible to ensure within it the fullest degree of intellectual freedom,” it said.\\nIntimidation and fear impede intellectual freedom.\\nGrowing tribalism means that many students are reticent to engage their peers\\nin real conversations. \\nThis silent passivity allowed overzealous administrators\\nand raucous students to limit the free exchange of ideas on campuses.\\nSome state policymakers, however, have refused to stand by idly as public universities began to confine free speech activity to narrow, often remote, strips of campus. \\nJonathan Butcher from The Heritage Foundation noted that Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, and Wisconsin have already taken corrective measures by eliminating free speech zones in their public universities. \\nArizona’s free speech protections, in particular, preserve the hallmarks of campus free speech since the “public areas of campus—such as sidewalks and campus lawns—are public forums and are open on the same terms to any speaker.”\\nMoreover, students who repeatedly infringe on others’\\nexpression of free speech can face expulsion.\\nIt’s unfortunate that policymakers must go to such great\\nlengths to protect a basic tenet of a free society in public universities. But the\\nmost distressing element of the conflict is the pervasive silence among\\nstudents who are unwilling to speak their minds.\\nUniversities were places where students challenged each\\nother, sometimes fiercely, and engaged in civil discourse.\\nCoretta Scott King envisioned the modern student as “a significant political actor with amazing power to influence the course of societies all over the world.” However, past students only earned her admiration because they were willing to engage their peers in civil discourse—exercising free speech.\\nTo be worthy of her plaudits, today’s students must break\\ntheir silence.',\n",

And it goes back to what research states,” Goins, noting the importance of a tailor-made education, told Ebony magazine. “Those of us who grew up black know that we respond to a supportive family-like environment, a place that understands who we are and appreciates who we are.” \\nButler College Prep is just one example of successful public charter schools that operate with less funding and greater autonomy. \\nInstead of being trapped by their ZIP codes, the advent\\nof charter schools meant that low-income parents were no longer compelled by\\nthe government to send their children to assigned district schools. Parents\\ncould vote with their feet for the first time.\\nFor many low-income families who live in America’s inner\\ncities, a feeling of helplessness is entrenched by high crime rates, gang\\nactivity, and cycles of intergenerational poverty. So, families are eager for\\nthe chance to choose their children’s schools.\\nSafety, innovative curricula, and unique missions give\\npublic charter schools the opportunity to impact specific communities and\\ntailor their programs to them. In fact, charter schools impact\\nstudent achievement most among low-income and academically\\nstruggling students.\\nFor example, CBS\\nNews\\nreported on a 2013 study that found that “black students gained the equivalent\\nof 14 days of learning by attending charter schools, but that black students\\nliving in poverty saw even greater benefits, the equivalent of 29 days in\\nreading and 36 days in math.”\\nBut charter schools do more than just increase academic\\ngains, they create environments where children feel safer and receive character\\nand values instruction—two of the top\\nthree priorities for parents.\\nFor instance, New York charter schools are safer than\\ntheir district school counterparts. As Max\\nEden\\nfrom the Manhattan Institute observed, “While every charter school is\\ndifferent, and the advantage is not universal, the conclusion is unmistakable:\\nFrom a parent’s perspective, a charter school is frequently the safest option\\nin the neighborhood.”\\nAnother advantage of charter schools is their autonomy,\\nwhich allows them to innovate in the classroom and to create a specialized\\nenvironment.\\nFor instance, Democracy Prep, which aims to increase civic participation among low-income and minority students, is a prime example of how charter schools instill values in students. \\nResearchers found that students enrolled at Democracy\\nPrep were more\\nlikely to register to vote and to vote in the 2016 election.\\nOpponents of charter schools, such as Sen. Bernie\\nSanders, I-Vt., argue that charter schools drain funds from district public\\nschools and prevent integration. In their minds, charter schools need greater\\nregulations to protect taxpayer dollars.\\nHigher regulations, however, can have adverse,\\nunintended consequences. \\nJonathan Butcher, senior policy analyst in the Center\\nfor Education Policy at The Heritage Foundation, discovered public school\\ndistricts rife with waste and fraud. \\n“There are districts with excess administrative\\nspending, vacant buildings supported by taxpayer resources, fraud, and theft …\\n. State lawmakers should require school districts to clean up the books … ,” he wrote.\\nSimilarly, the California Policy Center discovered\\nwasteful spending in the Los Angeles Unified School District, which provided\\npay bumps totaling $519\\nmillion annually to teachers who took classes directly related\\nto any subject taught in the school district. \\nOr take the billions\\nwasted on bumps to teacher salaries due to master’s of arts\\ndegrees. As Harvard economist Thomas\\nKane commented, “Paying teachers on the basis of master’s\\ndegrees is equivalent to paying them based on hair color.”\\nThe real drain on school district budgets comes from poor internal management and waste—not from quality charter school alternatives for families. Due to their near-monopoly, district schools lack the market pressures that should incentivize them to respond to student needs.\\nCharter schools in Wisconsin, on the other hand, achieved\\nbetter outcomes than district schools, according to a new study by Corey\\nDeAngelis of the Reason Foundation. \\nHe\\nfound that “private\\nand independent charter schools tend to be more cost-effective than\\ndistrict-run public schools in the state overall and for the vast majority of\\nindividual cities.”\\nSimilarly, charter\\nschools in Oakland, California, and in Los Angeles achieved nearly equal\\noutcomes while only operating at a fraction of the cost (63% and 73%, respectively). \\nAdditionally, a 2017 meta analysis of the literature on charter schools’ effect on integration found neutral to positive effect overall. \\nOn the whole, charter schools break up the geographic district school monopoly. But most importantly, parents—not big government—choose the school that best fits their children’s needs. Charter schools empower parents and give many children from low-income families opportunities that they could not otherwise afford.\\nThe first reference to Democracy Prep has been corrected to reflect the school’s correct name.',\n",
       " \"Virginia Walden Ford advocated school choice in the nation's capital after being one of the earliest students to attend an integrated school in Arkansas. (Photo: Tom Williams/Roll Call/Getty Images)\\n\\nJude Schwalbach\\n\\nJude Schwalbach is a research assistant in education policy at The Heritage Foundation.\\nWhen Virginia Walden Ford crossed the threshold of her new\\nhigh school in Little Rock, Arkansas, as one of the second wave of black\\nstudents to integrate the school, little did she know these were her first\\nsteps in a lifetime journey to champion educational opportunity for all\\nchildren. \\nFord would go on to help nearly 9,000 children attend their school of choice in Washington, D.C., and her story would be featured in the forthcoming movie “Miss Virginia.” \\xa0\\nDuring the 1990s, Ford was a single mom of three children in Washington, D.C. She was shocked at the condition of the local public schools, where eighth-graders were performing three grade levels below their peers across the nation in mathematics, according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress. \\nAs The Washington Post reported, “On average,\\xa0for each additional year that students stay in DCPS, the less likely they are to succeed, not because they are unable to succeed, but because the system does not prepare them to succeed.”\\nMoreover, a culture of drugs, crime, and violence was pervasive in D.C.’s low-income neighborhoods in the 1990s. Washington’s rate of violent crime was twice the national average, and nearly two-thirds of the District’s teachers said violent student behavior interfered with teaching, noted The Washington Post in 1996.\\nIn these dismal circumstances, Ford realized her youngest\\nson, William, already was struggling in the traditional public school and\\nfalling in with the wrong crowd. She knew he could not succeed unless he went\\nto a school that was a better fit for him.\\nFortunately, a neighbor provided a private school\\nscholarship for William. \\n“William was able to attend a school that I chose, that was in his best interest,” Ford said. “ … In a couple of months I saw this child [go from] being a child who hated to go to school, [who] was failing everything, to this kid [who] was just totally engaged in learning. And when I asked him why, he said that for the first time in his educational experience, he felt like people really cared about whether he learned or not.” \\nBecause of what happened to her son, Ford wanted to help\\nother children have similar opportunities. She became a leading proponent of\\nthe D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program, a private school tuition scholarship\\nfor D.C. children that provides up to $13,000 per year for tuition for students\\nfrom low-income families.\\nThe program enables students to escape D.C.’s dangerous\\nschools where, even today, many\\nchildren regularly skip school because they fear bullies, and 1 in 10\\nstudents report violent threats or injuries while on school property. \\nThe scholarship recipients graduated from high school and\\ncollege at higher rates, and most importantly, families were freed from the district\\nschool monopoly. \\n“I didn’t set out to fight for school choice or speak up for\\nother children,” Ford said. “I started out as an everyday mother, wanting the\\nabsolute best in opportunities for my kids. I quickly found that drive was\\nreflected in the hearts and minds of other parents who also felt trapped in an\\neducational system that was failing their children.”\\n“Miss Virginia” is\\na proper tribute to a woman who selflessly dedicated her life to helping the\\nnation’s capital’s most vulnerable children.\\nAlthough she has returned to Little Rock, the movie telling\\nFord’s story will reach her biggest audience yet—the American people.\\nD.C. locals can view an exclusive “Miss Virginia” pre-screening on Oct. 7, at 6 p.m. in Sidney Harman Hall. \\nThis article has been corrected to say that Ford helped nearly 9,000 D.C. schoolchildren attend a school of their choice. \",\n",
       " 'Micro-schools are tiny, autonomous private schools typically enrolling fewer than 70 students. (Photo: Klaus Vedfelt/Getty Images)\\n\\nJude Schwalbach\\n\\nJude Schwalbach is a research assistant in education policy at The Heritage Foundation.\\nWith the school year in full swing, anxious parents hope\\ntheir children are content in their local schools. Families worry about finding\\nthe right school environment for their children, especially since every child\\nlearns differently. \\nTake the Gilbert family, in Florida, whose story captures the importance of having multiple education options. \\nFour of their five children have special needs, and the family travels “80 miles per day, 180 days a year” to four different schools. But it’s worth it, since Stephanie Gilbert “had no idea how much each child would each change over time, or how their needs would transform as well.”\\n“The ability to find different schools to meet those\\nunique and changing needs became invaluable,” she said.\\nWhile most parents don’t encounter the hurdles common to\\nthe Gilbert family, most can relate to the struggle of finding the school that\\nbest accommodates their children, especially when families’ education options\\nare severely restricted due to geographic or financial limitations.\\nOne way educators try to provide alternative schooling\\noptions is by establishing “micro-schools.”\\nThey are tiny, autonomous private schools, typically enrolling fewer than 70 students. Michael B. Horn of Education Next describes “the ethos of micro-schools: a fidelity to personalization and success for all in small communities.”\\nThese schooling options create innovative and\\npersonalized learning experiences for students, such as using multi-age\\nclassrooms or encouraging personal relationships to boost learning. \\nBusiness\\nInsider points out the benefits of the approach. The “micro-school”\\nmodel brings students of all ages into the same classroom, “using technology to\\ncater the curriculum to each child’s needs.”\\n“Teachers serve as facilitators, rather than lecturers, and kids learn through projects, not memorization,” it said.\\nDue to their small size, micro-schools are nimble. As a recent Bellwether Education Partners’ report notes, “There are no administrators. Teachers …  tend to have a real entrepreneurial drive. They want to be in the position to make decisions about the administrative things.”\\nMany micro-schools are geared toward working with children from low-income families. While private school tuition is often out of reach for low-income families, more than half of micro-schools offer financial aid to upwards of one-third of their student body. For example, The Forest School in Fayetteville, Georgia, offers approximately $4,000 in financial aid per pupil to 20% of its student body.\\nYet, even with financial aid, many low-income families struggle to foot the bill. States, however, can help students find their best schooling option by strengthening their school choice policies.\\nFor instance, Arizona policymakers expanded the state’s Empowerment\\nScholarship Accounts program to include Native American children on tribal\\nlands.\\nWith an education savings account, families can pay for private school tuition, online learning, special education services and therapies, private tutors, and a host of other education-related services, products, and providers. \\nNative American families immediately put those funds to\\ngood use by creating their own micro-school. \\nHadassah John started a new micro-school, Prenda, on the San Carlos Apache Reservation in Arizona because she was frustrated by the local public school’s failure to prevent bullying or to challenge students. \\nThe executive editor of RedefinEd, Matthew Ladner, commented on the area surrounding John’s school: “The local school district\\xa0spends well above the Arizona state average,\\xa0but earned a letter grade of F from the state. Parent reviews, and even a teacher review, on the\\xa0Great Schools\\xa0site are scathing.”\\nArizona’s recent reforms were imperative since the\\ntraditional public school at the San Carlos Reservation failed to produce\\nstudent growth. \\nAs Ladner\\nnotes, “All Arizona racial/ethnic subgroups scored equal to or above the\\nnational average on eighth-grade math and reading in 2017 except Native\\nAmerican students.” \\nJohn’s micro-school will give students the attention and\\nenvironment where they can flourish. \\nMicro-schools can offer education options to families\\nwho have few other choices. No child’s ZIP code should trap them in a failing\\npublic school, and education savings accounts ensure that families have a\\nchoice. \\nPolicymakers throughout the nation can empower more\\nfamilies by letting them choose the school that is the best fit for their\\nchildren.',\n",
       " 'Despite high spending on public education, just two out of 10 eighth-graders in Washington, D.C., public schools can read or do math proficiently. (Photo: Weedezign/Getty Images)\\n\\nJude Schwalbach\\n\\nJude Schwalbach is a research assistant in education policy at The Heritage Foundation.\\n\\nLindsey Burke\\n/\\n@lindseymburke\\n\\nLindsey M. Burke researches and writes on federal and state education issues as the Will Skillman fellow in education policy at The Heritage Foundation. Read her research.\\nSpending by Washington, D.C., public schools can be difficult to pin down.\\nEstimates suggest spending is somewhere between $27,000 and $29,000 per child per year, which is roughly double the national average. Assuming $27,000 per student per year, D.C. taxpayers spend about $350,000 on a student from kindergarten through graduation.\\nOne could be forgiven for expecting good educational outcomes for such breathtaking sums. Yet educational outcomes in the District of Columbia are one of the clearest examples of the disconnect between spending and academic achievement.\\nRecently released National Assessment of Educational Progress scores make that clear.\\nAlthough the District has made considerable progress on the national assessment—often referred to as “the nation’s report card”—over the past two decades, the city’s scores for eighth-graders still fall short of the national average by nearly 20 points—approximately two grade levels of learning.\\nIn eighth-grade math, for example, D.C. students scored 16 points below the national average. In reading, D.C. students were 19 points behind their peers across the country.\\nProficiency levels in reading and math also leave much to be desired. Among fourth-graders, 32 percent scored proficient or better in math, and 29 percent scored proficient in reading. Just 20 percent of eighth-graders tested proficient or better in reading, and just 21 percent in math.\\nThat’s right: Just two out of 10 eighth-graders in D.C. public schools can read or do math proficiently.\\nIn addition to lackluster academic outcomes, achievement gaps persist among students. If future performance replicates the past 20 years, the reading achievement gap between children from low-income families trail three grade levels behind their more affluent classmates in math.\\n\\n“Expert-driven” reforms in the District have failed to produce notable improvements. As the Manhattan Institute’s Max Eden and I note:\\nEducation reformers used to celebrate D.C.’s dramatic decline in school suspensions. Then a\\xa0Washington Post\\xa0investigation revealed that it was fake; administrators had merely taken suspensions off the books.\\nThe same reformers used to celebrate D.C.’s sharp increase in high-school graduations. Then an NPR investigation revealed that it, too, was fake; almost half of students who missed more than half the year graduated.\\nThere have, however, been some bright spots in the nation’s capital. Although charter schools scored only eight points higher than noncharter schools in eighth-grade math, charters deserve recognition, having achieved better results at significantly lower cost.\\nAnd as education scholar Matthew Ladner noted, the charter schools are at a disadvantage, since transfer students often “experience a temporary academic setback.” Consequently, as charter schools become more established with more stable student bodies, they can “improve with age.”\\nOverall, the scores on “the nation’s report card” illustrate the District of Columbia’s acute need for improved education performance.\\nThe past 20 years illustrate some progress, especially at the fourth-grade level, where students are within one grade level of the national average. However, the slow momentum gained with the fourth-graders does not persist at the eighth-grade level, where students struggle to improve, trailing the national average by 16 to 19 points in math and reading.\\nIn 2003, the city laid the groundwork for what has been the brightest spot in education in the District—namely, the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program.\\nThe D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program—a school voucher program open to students from low-income families—has produced excellent academic attainment results.\\nBeyond other reasons to applaud the school choice option, such as happier parents and safer students, an experimental evaluation commissioned by the Department of Education found that students who used a scholarship graduated at a rate 21 percentage points higher than their peers who were awarded a voucher but did not use it.\\nD.C. would be well-served by expanding access to the Opportunity Scholarship Program and by formula-funding the program so that parents can rely on it to be there in the future.\\nExpanding school choice in D.C. will enhance education at all grade levels because parents will be able to match their children with educational options that are the right fit. Instead of having limited options based largely on where they live, parents empowered by choice can find the school that best fits the academic and social needs of their children.\\nThe National Assessment of Educational Progress scores show that D.C. children remain in dire need of access to better education options. Expanding school choice can make that a reality.',\n",
       " 'The Supreme Court will decide on a Montana case involving discrimination against religious schools in a K-12 tax credit program.

Burke researches and writes on federal and state education issues as the Will Skillman fellow in education policy at The Heritage Foundation. Read her research.\\nAnti-Catholic prejudice, which spread like gangrene in the 19th and 20th centuries, often manifested itself in so-called Blaine Amendments, which enabled government discrimination against religious families, students, and schools. \\nThis month, the Supreme Court will have the opportunity to overturn one such law. \\nIn Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue, the court will examine Montana’s decision to exclude religious schools from its K-12 tax credit scholarship program. \\nThe scholarship program itself is a good idea—helping parents get their kids into the type of school best suited to their needs. But by citing its Blaine Amendment to lock religious schools out of the program, Montana exerted unconstitutional prejudice.\\nThe Montana program offered a $150 tax credit to private citizens who donate toward scholarships but prohibited families from using the scholarships at religious schools. Montana’s Supreme Court struck down the entire program, and it is this decision the U.S. Supreme Court is being asked to overturn. \\nUltimately,\\nthe state terminated the program because of controversy over the religious\\nexclusion. That’s when Kendra Espinoza and two other mothers whose children\\nattend religious schools sued the state of Montana.\\nBut the case raises the broader issue of whether America’s diverse student population is best served by homogeneity or by choice. \\nParents have differing views about the purpose of education. As University of Arkansas professor Jay Greene has written, “Since people have legitimate differences about what constitutes a good life and how children can best be raised for that good life, there will be legitimate differences about the content, manner, and goals of education.” \\nThe case could determine whether parents are free to determine what type of education will help their children achieve that good life. \\nFor many families, values-based education is a critical component in preparing their children to be productive members of society. \\nA growing body of research demonstrates not only that access to school choice improves academic achievement and attainment, but that private school choice also increases parents’ and students’ perceptions of school safety and has significant positive effects on character development, as seen in increased tolerance, charitable giving, and volunteerism, among other factors. \\nMontana’s program benefited all families, but then the state passed a rule to reconcile it with the state Constitution’s “no aid” provision (known as a “Blaine Amendment”). Article 10 of Montana’s Constitution prohibits “aid” from going to “any school … controlled in whole or in part by any church, sect, or denomination.” \\nThe high court has\\ncommented on the ignoble aims of these amendments in previous cases.\\nIn Mitchell\\nv. Helms, a 2000 case upholding the use of school vouchers, Justice Clarence\\nThomas wrote, “Consideration of the amendment arose at a\\ntime of pervasive hostility to the Catholic Church and to Catholics in general,\\nand it was an open secret that sectarian was code for Catholic.”\\nThirty-seven states brought this prejudice into the 21st century, using these laws to exclude religious entities in a variety of contexts, including school choice. \\nThe question for the Supreme Court is whether it will allow states to continue to impose disadvantages upon families like Kendra Espinoza’s as they seek to educate their children according to their own beliefs. \\nAs the Jewish Coalition for Religious Liberty wrote in a friend-of-the-court brief, “The Blaine Amendment forces Jewish parents to confront a Hobson’s choice between their financial security and their community’s religious continuity.” \\nFor an Orthodox Jewish student, a public school can be a difficult place to fulfill his or her religious obligations. To observe Jewish holidays, they cannot write, use electricity, or travel by car or bus, which means they would need to miss approximately a dozen days of school each year. \\nThe Anti-Defamation League notes “absence could wrongly convey the message that school or a class is not important to a student or his or her family.” \\nIn a Jewish day school, these holidays would be observed formally by all. But, for many families the price of Jewish day school is overwhelming. \\nBeing able to take their share of education funding to a school that aligns with their needs would make a significant difference, putting them on equal terms with students attending non-religious private schools.\\nThe court need only follow its 2017 decision in Trinity Lutheran v. Comer to overturn Montana’s “no aid” provision. \\nIn that case, Missouri was using its Blaine Amendment to exclude a church-run preschool from a state-funded playground improvement program. \\nWriting for the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts announced that “the exclusion of Trinity Lutheran from a public benefit for which it is otherwise qualified, solely because it is a church, is odious to our Constitution … and cannot stand.” \\nIn the Espinoza case, attorneys for Montana argue that allowing the tax credit to go toward religious schools would force a Jewish resident who doesn’t want to subsidize Christian education to choose between his religious beliefs and the tax credit. \\nBut excluding religious schools from the tax credit program would not end taxpayer money being directed toward diverse schools. It would simply create a one-way street for the taxes of Jews, Catholics, Muslims, and those of other faiths to go toward secular private and public schools where their children cannot learn according to their religious values and traditions. \\nFinally, Montana argues that the Supreme Court’s 2004 decision in Locke v. Davey is controlling. Washington state had a Promise Scholarship Program that prevented college students from using it to study “devotional theology,” although students were permitted to attend religious schools and take religious courses. \\nThe court upheld the program, explaining that Washington’s decision reflected the “historic and substantial state interest” in declining to subsidize the “essentially religious endeavor” of “[t]raining someone to lead a congregation.”\\nAs the Department of Justice notes, in Trinity Lutheran, the court “interpreted Davey to mean that, where a state denies funds because of what the recipient ‘propose[s] to do’ with those funds, rather than because of the recipient’s identity, the state’s ‘historic’ interests may justify a refusal to fund certain ‘essentially religious endeavor[s].’” \\nBut Montana has categorically denied funds to religious schools and families because of their status and identity, not because the funds were being used for an essentially religious endeavor or purpose such as clergy training. \\nIn the Supreme Court’s recent establishment clause decision, American Legion v. American Humanist Association, which permitted a cross-shaped World War 1 memorial to stand, Justice Samuel Alito wrote that “the religion clauses of the Constitution aim to foster a society in which people of all beliefs can live together harmoniously.” \\nSimilarly, as Greene writes, “Americans’ concern for liberty should incline them toward respecting different approaches to education.”\\xa0 \\nIn Espinoza, the court should interpret these principles to mean that a state should allow parents to choose how to use a privately funded scholarship administered by the state. \\nProtecting religious freedom against official prejudice will foster social harmony by allowing all families to educate the next generation according to their unique values and traditions.',\n",

Police had been called to the shooter’s home 45 times to\\ndeal with incidents involving him or his brother. \\nPollack and Eden identify the shooter throughout by his\\nprison number, 18-1958. 18-1958 had been in a fight in school, repeatedly\\nissued death threats to other students, and was prohibited from bringing a\\nbackpack to school so as not to be able to conceal weapons in it. \\nYet as Pollack notes, when the shooter bought his guns, “he\\nhad a totally clean record. On paper, he was a model citizen.” \\nHow did his record stay so clean?\\nPollack and Eden meticulously document that district and\\nschool officials did not stop 18-1958 because of the district’s policy to limit\\nstudent suspensions and expulsions. That policy—the PROMISE Program—also\\ndeterred educators from referring students to police. \\nSuch leniency, Eden argues, meant that officials neglected opportunities to refer 18-1958 to law enforcement, allowing him to avoid arrest, which ultimately made it possible for him to buy a gun.\\n>>> Same Policies That Failed to Stop Florida Shooter Exist in School Districts Nationwide\\nWhile the media at large focused on lack of “gun control” as\\nthe major problem, Pollack and Eden explain that PROMISE and the related rules\\non student discipline—which the Obama administration had then promulgated in\\nschool districts across the country—are undeniably at the center of this\\ntragedy. \\nThe PROMISE Program “deters teachers from reporting\\ndisciplinary problems and makes administrators less inclined to trust teachers’\\nintuition and more inclined to make decisions that produce the disciplinary\\n‘data’ that their district-level superiors want to see,” Pollack and Eden\\nwrite.\\nAt every possible turn, the adults in the system ignored glaring warning signs. Pollack and Eden write that 18-1958’s story is “a cautionary tale of what can happen when everyone in a school system has an incentive to do the wrong thing.” \\xa0\\nPollack and Eden’s book is difficult to read because Pollack’s\\npain, sorrow, and frustration is present on nearly every page. Furthermore, the\\ndetailed recounting of the tragedy pulls no punches in identifying the policies\\nthat allowed this disaster to happen. \\n“Every step of the way, [district officials] had a choice:\\ndo the responsible thing and help [18-1958], or do the politically correct\\nthing and ignore him. They made the wrong choice every single time,” Pollack writes\\nin one section.\\n>>> 1 Year After Parkland Massacre, Broward County’s School Board Still Failing\\nThe most troubling part of the book, aside from the actual\\nretelling of the shooting, is the ending. \\nAfter an exhausting effort to change the composition of the\\nBroward County School Board failed in 2018, the authors express fear that voter\\napathy is so deeply-rooted that even a disaster like Parkland is not enough to\\nget people interested in local elections. \\nIn his epilogue, Pollack pleads with readers: “You simply\\nhave to step up, get involved, and make a difference for your children. You\\ncan’t let your schools be run like the Broward County Public School District.”\\nReaders will be left shaking their heads at the district’s systemic\\nfailures, administrators’ abdication of responsibility, and the abundance of\\nadult negligence. \\nEvery school leader should read this book and safeguard\\nagainst such a lax disciplinary environment being replicated in their districts—and\\nevery parent should read it to hold school officials accountable. Children’s\\nlives depend on it.\",\n",

They face hostility toward opinions that don’t conform to the predominantly leftist thinking on campus. \\nThey’re also immersed in identity politics that pit students of different backgrounds against one another. \\nDespite these problems, colleges continue to raise tuition. Because federal loan money is handed out with little scrutiny as to the student’s ability to pay it back, colleges have had free reign to raise prices at levels often double the inflation rate. \\nFlush with all that money, their first spending priority often isn’t the classroom but the bureaucracy. \\nFrom 1987 to 2012, America’s higher education system added more than half a million administrators, doubling the number of administrators relative to the number of faculty. \\nTo pay for these ever-increasing costs, students are borrowing\\nmore money and taking on more and more debt. \\nAnd with federal loans accounting for much of the $1.5 trillion\\nin outstanding student loan debt and more than a million people defaulting on\\ntheir loans, taxpayers are picking up much of the tab for this broken system.\\nSo, what’s the solution?\\nWhile politicians often suggest throwing more money at the problem, that will only make things worse. \\nIn fact, the surest way to stop the sharp rise in both college tuition and student debt is to get the federal government out of the student loan business. \\nThat cuts off the open spigot of money that has allowed colleges to increase costs virtually without limit.\\nRestoring private lending will make the loan market more responsible and cause colleges to rein in costs, creating more affordable choices for students. \\nPrivate lending will also limit taxpayers’ exposure to billions of dollars in loan defaults. \\nOne emerging private lending solution is coming from colleges themselves in the form of income share agreements. \\nSuch agreements allow students to obtain financing from their schools and pay it back based on a percentage of their income after graduation. \\nThat means their monthly loan payments are lower when their income is lower, ensuring that loan payoffs are more affordable, or that they can pay them off quicker when their income is higher. \\nThis system allows students to see—before they take on debt or\\nchoose a major—what types of careers will allow them to pay off their loans\\nquicker and what kind of future they are investing in. \\nThis kind of cost savings and transparency is a win for\\nstudents, for taxpayers, and for fiscal sanity.',\n",

According to researchers for the Pew Charitable Trust’s Economic Mobility Project, it’s the child’s family circumstances, with\\xa0schools\\xa0ranking as the second-most important factor.\\nIn the U.S., family circumstances and schools are closely linked, because most\\xa0cities\\xa0and counties link schooling to housing. The extent to which families can select schools is largely determined by the extent to which they can afford to select their neighborhood.\\nThis arrangement effectively limits the prospects of upward mobility for millions of children across the country. \\nIn 2013, the real estate brokerage firm Redfin analyzed more than 400,000 home sales. It found that, on average, families paid $50 more per square foot for houses in highly rated school districts. \\nIn one case, Redfin found a house priced $130,000 more than its “twin” (in terms of square footage and number of rooms) less than a mile away. The main difference? The first was in a highly rated school district; the other was not.\\nAlthough the Redfin study did not control for other potential confounding variables, its findings underscore what we all already know: Housing choice is school choice.\\nMany of the country’s largest school districts give families no alternative to the nearest public school. They offer no charter schools, no school vouchers–no school choice programs of any kind. \\nInstead, kids are consigned to a dysfunctional school.\\nFourth graders in Baltimore and Philadelphia public schools are reading more than two grade levels behind their peers nationally, according to the\\xa0Nation’s Report Card. Detroit’s fourth-graders are reading nearly four grades behind their peers.\\nYet parents in large public school districts often have even bigger concerns than whether Johnny can read. They’re worried more about their children’s safety. And with good reason.\\nFrom September through December last year, Chicago Public Schools dealt with more than\\xa0600 allegations of sexual violence. In the year before that, 10% of high school students in Washington, D.C., public schools were\\xa0threatened or injured with a weapon\\xa0on school property.\\nNationwide, the National Center for Education Statistics reported\\xa0more than 827,000 incidents\\xa0of crime among students aged 12 to 18, including sexual assault, robbery, and theft.\\nUpward mobility doesn’t just require that schools keep students safe and teach them to read; it requires that schools imbue students with that cultural currency that will enable them to be productive members of a free society.\\nHere, too, many public schools are failing. Today, one-third of Americans–the vast majority products of our public schools–cannot name a single branch of government.\\nNor is an uptick in civic literacy visible anywhere on the horizon. Instead, public schools seem more interested in introducing their pupils to leftist ideology than in teaching basic civics.\\nUnsurprisingly, California is leading the way in this endeavor. \\nAfter introducing a much-derided sex education framework earlier this year (with no opt-out for families), the Golden State has now introduced an ethnic studies curriculum that brings the social justice warrior mentality of grad schools to grade schools.\\nWilliamson Evers of the Hoover Institution calls it training for “ideological activists and proponents of identity politics.”\\nInez Stepman of the Independent Women’s Forum wrote that with its references to terms like “cis-heteropatriarchy” and its broadside against capitalism, the curriculum “reads as though ripped from a Berkeley seminar on ‘critical whiteness studies.’”\\nAll this while, as my colleague Jonathan Butcher points out, 57% of California’s black fourth-graders cannot read at even a basic level.\\nThese disappointing outcomes support the notion that public education is actually hindering upward mobility for its students.\\nWhen government assigns children to schools that are failing every test of quality–safety, learning, and civic literacy–it is saddling those kids with lifetime opportunity costs.\\nYet it need not be that way.\\nSchool choice programs allow students to attend schools that meet their learning needs. And studies show that when students avail themselves of these options, they develop better both\\xa0academically\\xa0and as citizens (as measured by things like political tolerance and civic engagement). Their parents are more satisfied as well.\\nA near-monopoly education system that denies students access to schools that would better serve them impedes upward mobility in America. It will not get better until we separate housing from schooling, through universal education choice.\\nOriginally published in Fox News',\n",

Read her research.\\n“The biggest problem plaguing U.S. public schools [is]\\na lack of resources.” \\nSo claims Robert Pianta, dean of the University of Virginia’s Curry School of Education, in an op-ed published last week in The Washington Post. In fact, Pianta asserts, government spending on K-12 education actually has declined since the 1980s. \\nThese claims are inaccurate, as federal government data\\nprove.\\nIn fact, it is so clear that government spending on K-12 education has increased dramatically—after adjusting for inflation—that The Washington Post just issued a correction to Pianta’s article:\\nCorrection: An earlier version of this piece stated that, adjusting for constant dollars, public funding for schools had decreased since the late 1980s. This is not the case. In fact, funding at the federal, state and local levels has increased between the 1980s and 2019.\\nThe Post was wise to issue the correction. In real dollars, total government spending per pupil increased from $7,359 in 1980 to $9,850 by 1990, reaching $13,180 per pupil by 2015. \\nTaking a longer view, real spending per student in public schools has increased from $2,763 in 1960 to more than $13,000 today.\\nConsiderable evidence shows that government spending\\nhas little if any relationship to academic achievement. Inflation-adjusted\\nspending has quadrupled since 1960, four years before President Lyndon Johnson\\nlaunched his Great Society education programs designed to wage a War on Poverty\\nand narrow opportunity gaps between affluent and poor children. \\nAs Stanford economist Eric Hanushek explains, despite this fourfold increase in government spending, student outcomes remained flat:\\nThis productivity decline is remarkable, particularly when compared with dynamic improvements in productivity elsewhere in the U.S. economy. Schooling outcomes are the same in 2015 as they were four decades before, even though school funding is now several times as high.\\nNotably, as both Hanushek and Harvard’s Paul Peterson have documented, the gap in learning between students from the top 10% and bottom 10%\\xa0of family income was the equivalent of four years’ worth of learning prior to the launch of the Great Society. Today, it stands unchanged—at four years’ worth of learning.\\n>>> Related: The Not-So-Great Society\\nIt is possible that Pianta was basing his assertion\\nthat school spending has declined on what he hears from teachers, who may not\\nfeel the increases in spending. As EdChoice’s\\nMike McShane and Jason Bedrick have documented,\\nmost of that spending has been captured by the schooling bureaucracy. \\nThis nice chart originating from Kennesaw State University’s Ben Scafidi puts a finer point on it:\\nBut no matter how you slice the data, contra Pianta, spending is in fact up. It is the one thing that has been tried ad nauseam. What hasn’t been tried is changing not what is spent, but who controls the dollars that are spent.\\nGiving families, rather than government officials, control over education funding is what will make a difference long term—a fact the data clearly support. Education choice improves academic achievement, attainment, safety, satisfaction, and a host of other important outcomes in later life.\\nSo let’s set the record straight on education\\nspending, and what really matters for students across the country.',\n",

Over those past two decades, while federal policymakers\\nwere busy enacting new federal laws, creating mandates for local school\\nleaders, and increasing the Department of Education’s budget from $38 billion\\nin 2000 (unadjusted for inflation) to roughly $70 billion today, the math and\\nreading performance of American high school students remained completely flat.

It was time, they argued, for the U.S.\\nto have the same “epiphany” Germany did in the late 1990s, and adopt\\ncentrally planned national standards and tests.\\nGermany now lags\\nthe U.S. in reading, according to the new Programme for International Student\\nAssessment data, and is far below Canada, a country that does not have national\\nstandards. \\nIndeed, our\\nneighbor to the north has performed consistently well on the\\nProgramme for International Student\\nAssessment since 2000, significantly outpacing the United States, and has neither national standards,\\nnor a federal education department. \\nCanada’s is a\\ndecentralized education system, in which Canada’s 10 provinces set education\\npolicy.\\nThe fact that\\nCommon Core didn’t catalyze improvements in the U.S. isn’t surprising. Large-scale\\ngovernment programs rarely, if ever, do. \\nBut neither have\\nthe myriad federal programs created since No Child Left Behind in 2001, nor\\nhave the more than 100 federal K-12 education programs created since President Lyndon\\nJohnson launched his Great Society initiative in 1965 designed, ostensibly, to\\nnarrow opportunity gaps between the poor and the affluent. \\nHeritage’s\\nJonathan Butcher and I detail Yuval Levin’s theory of government failure in “The Not-So-Great Society.” Levin explains that large-scale\\ngovernment programs fail for three reasons:\\nFederal\\ngovernment efforts to improve education have been dismal. Even if there were a\\nconstitutional basis for its involvement—which there isn’t—the federal\\ngovernment is simply ill-positioned to determine what education policies will\\nbest serve the diverse local communities across our vast nation.\\nThe sooner we can\\nacknowledge that improvements will not come from Washington, the sooner we’re\\nlikely to see students flourishing in learning environments that reflect their\\nunique needs and desires.

Montana Department of Revenue, deals with Montana’s tax credit of up to $150 per year for donations taxpayers make to a scholarship-granting organization. \\nThe scholarship-granting organization then provides scholarships to income-eligible children to attend a private school of their choice. \\nRecipients may use the funds at qualified schools, which initially included religiously affiliated private schools. Then the Montana Department of Revenue enacted a rule excluding religious schools, citing the state constitution’s “no aid” provision (known as a Blaine Amendment) that prohibits public money from going to churches. \\nFamilies with children at\\nreligious schools challenged that rule, arguing that it violates their federal\\nconstitutional right to free exercise of religion. \\nReligiously affiliated schools\\nmake up 69% of\\nprivate schools in Montana. If\\nthis rule were to be allowed to stand, it would shut out a large percentage of\\nschools from the scholarship program, limiting the options of families that relied\\non this assistance to send their children to the school of their choice. \\nThe good news is\\nthat the Supreme Court set the stage\\nfor the Espinoza case with its 2017 ruling in Trinity\\nLutheran Church v. Comer.\\n\\nIn that decision, the high court\\nheld that the state of Missouri violated the First Amendment’s Free Exercise\\nClause when it\\nbarred a church-run day care center from receiving a grant to resurface its\\nplayground. \\nThe state of Missouri argued that it was trying to avoid running afoul of the Establishment Clause, which prohibits states from recognizing an official state church. In doing so, Missouri trampled on Trinity Lutheran’s free exercise rights. \\nTo be sure, there is some “play in the joints”\\xa0between what the Establishment and Free Exercise clauses require of states.\\nWriting for the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts explained that by singling out the day care center for disfavored treatment and “denying a qualified religious entity a public benefit because of its religious character,” Missouri went “too far.” \\nRoberts wrote in a footnote that\\nthe decision was limited to “express discrimination based on religious identity\\nwith respect to playground resurfacing” and stressed that the decision “do[es]\\nnot address religious uses of funding or other forms of discrimination.” \\nJustice Neil Gorsuch disagreed that the ruling was limited. \\nIn a concurring opinion, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, Gorsuch concluded that the “general principles” of this decision “do not permit discrimination against religious exercise—whether on the playground or anywhere else.”\\nShortly after issuing this decision, the justices instructed courts in Colorado and New Mexico to square their rulings in cases dealing with a school voucher program and a textbook-lending program with the Trinity Lutheran decision. \\nThus, the scope of the Trinity\\nLutheran ruling remains unclear, and now the high court has the opportunity in\\nthe Espinoza case to make clear that states may not require religious\\norganizations to check their beliefs at the door before entering the secular\\nworld. \\nIf allowing a church-run day care center\\nto compete for state grant money does not violate the Establishment Clause,\\nthen surely there aren’t Establishment Clause concerns raised by allowing\\nfamilies to use scholarship money at religious schools, for which donors\\nreceive a modest tax credit. \\nIndeed, in Zelman v.\\nSimmons-Harris (2002), the court\\nnoted the “consistent distinction” it has drawn between “government programs\\nthat provide aid directly to religious schools … and programs of true private\\nchoice, in which government aid reaches religious schools only as a result of\\nthe genuine and independent choices of private individuals.” \\nOn several occasions, the high court\\nhas rejected Establishment Clause challenges to “neutral government programs\\nthat provide aid directly to a broad class of individuals, who, in turn, direct\\nthe aid to religious schools … of their own choosing.” \\nThe state’s Blaine Amendment also should\\nnot provide cover for preventing families from choosing to use these\\nscholarship funds at religious schools. \\nSource: Lindsey Burke and Jarrett Stepman, Journal of School\\nChoice, Blaine Amendment adoption\\nMore than three\\ndozen states have Blaine Amendments, named for Sen. James G. Blaine, R-Maine,\\nwho in the late 1800s pushed for an amendment to the U.S. Constitution\\nprohibiting aid to “sectarian” schools. \\nAs Thomas explained in the 2000 decision Mitchell v. Helms, “Consideration of the amendment arose at a time of pervasive hostility to the Catholic Church and to Catholics in general, and it was an open secret that sectarian was code for Catholic.” \\nAlthough Blaine failed in his bid to amend the Constitution, many states—some on condition of statehood—adopted their own Blaine Amendments. \\nToday, these ignoble\\n19th-century amendments often thwart modern-day school choice efforts as more\\nand more states move toward systems that enable families to direct their\\nchild’s education funding to education options that work for them. \\nWith any luck, the court will use the Espinoza case to heed Thomas’ advice that “this doctrine, born of bigotry, should be buried” and pave the way for school choice across the country. \\nThe justices will hear oral argument in the Espinoza case during their next term, starting in October, and release a decision by the end of June 2020. \\n>>>Listen to “SCOTUS 101,” a podcast with Elizabeth Slattery and friends bringing you up to speed on what’s happening at the Supreme Court.',\n",

Johnson’s programs really did for public education, and it’s little that is positive. She also suggests how we can begin to solve the problems the government has inflicted on the education system.\\xa0\\xa0\\nWe also break down these stories:\\xa0\\nAnd our Problematic Woman of the Week is The Heritage Foundation’s Lindsey Burke, co-editor of “The Not-So-Great Society.” Get the book here. For the interview with her, listen to the podcast or read the lightly edited transcript below. \\nLauren Evans: We are here at The Heritage Foundation’s President’s Club, where we are joined by Heritage’s education research fellow, Lindsey Burke. And she has just released a new book, “The Not-So-Great Society.” Welcome, Lindsey.  Lindsey Burke: Thank you for having me. Virginia Allen: All right, Lindsey, let’s jump right in. I want to start with the title of the book. It’s pretty unique, “The Not-So-Great Society,” and in that title you’re referring back to President Lyndon B. Johnson, who in the 1960s launched a set of domestic programs that were intended to better society. \\nThere was a large focus on the education system, but can you tell us a little bit more about what President Johnson’s Great Society was really intended to do and what was the effect that it had on public education? Burke: Yeah, I think that’s a really good way to frame it. What was it intended to do and what were the actual outcomes? I’m reminded of the quote that [economist] Milton Friedman said about intentions, right? He said, “One of the great mistakes is to judge policies and programs by their intentions, rather than by their results.” \\nI think we have to put the Great Society, all of the programs that it initiated, in that bucket. That while there were intentions on the part of President—and we can debate what those intentions might’ve been—the outcomes have been lackluster, to put it mildly. \\nThe Great Society, when it kicked off in 1965, Johnson said [of] the war on poverty [that] one-third of it would be fought in the classrooms of America. And what that did was it set the stage for a federal preschool program known as Head Start that still exists today. A K-12 system of programs in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which everybody might know better, it eventually became known as No Child Left Behind. And then The Higher Education Act, which got the federal government into the game of underwriting student loans for students across the country. \\nThe outcomes of those programs have really been subpar, to say the least. And in the case of higher ed in particular really produced, I would argue, the exact opposite outcome of the intentions that were laid out at 1965. Evans: So when did this start going wrong? Was the program kind of a failure from the start? Are we just now seeing these negative consequences? Burke: It really was a failure from the start. Now we have about a half-century to really evaluate exactly what those failures were and how bad they were. I think one of the unique contributions of this book is to sort of take that long view and look at all of the various outcomes. But I would argue it really started from the moment that we got the federal government so intrinsically involved in education policy, which we did in ’65. If you look back to the early days of the republic, there was really no federal involvement whatsoever in education. We actually got a really small Department of Education that popped up in 1867, but it was downgraded a year later to a small little Office of Education to gather statistics. And then if you fast-forward a little bit, in 1944 we get the GI Bill. And the GI Bill, which we all know supported returning [World War II] service members who wanted to go to college. But the GI Bill was really one of the first sort of significant pieces of the federal government getting involved.\\nThat was it. From the beginning of the republic to the GI Bill, you had very, very modest federal involvement. The national school lunch program pops up, but it’s modest. And then all of a sudden something changes. In 1957, we see the Soviets launch Sputnik. And this is of course the first earth-orbiting satellite. And then a month later, in November of ’57, they launch Sputnik II. And at that point, President Eisenhower says, “OK, we’ve got to leverage the federal government to provide some additional federal spending to support scientists and mathematicians.” \\nBut at that point it was really a national security prerogative. So it was appropriate for the federal government to spend some money. But what the Great Society did was it turned that on its head. And so you get Lyndon Johnson, who comes in as president in 1964, and in his first State of the Union address, he announces an all-out war on poverty in America. \\nThat was really the catalyst for this huge Great Society push that he eventually laid out and got signed into law, that affected everything from grade school to grad school. So we can talk a little bit about the outcomes of those programs specifically, but they have been poor to say the least when it comes to preschool. They have not moved the needle at all in terms of K-12 policy, and they have led to massive increases in college costs at the higher education level. Evans: And before these federal education programs were created, it wasn’t like this was when public education started. Just before then it was left up to the states, correct? Burke: That’s right. And localities even better. It’s a really good question because for the most part, education is a state and local issue. And even in the wake of all of the federal intervention that Johnson catalyzed, today the federal government is still just an 8.5% stakeholder on all K-12 education spending. \\nSo education is a quintessentially state and local issue. It’s about a 45/45 split if we want to get really technical in the revenue at the state and local level. But it is something that is supposed to be locally driven. It’s supposed to be close to families. Programs and education are supposed to be situated closest to the people that they impact. Which is why it was so ill advised from the very beginning, to get to your earlier point about having the federal government enter that domain. The federal government is the farthest it can possibly be from the students and families and individuals these programs impact. Allen: So let’s wait a minute to talk about the effect that it’s had on colleges. Let’s start with elementary and high school. What did we have before that was so good? And then what have we lost within elementary and high school with the implementation of the Great Society? Burke: That’s a great question. At the K-12 level, the elementary and high school level, we have seen completely flat academic outcomes since the program began in ’65. We have a chapter in our book, “The Not-So-Great Society,” by Harvard’s Paul Peterson. And he talks about how in 1965 students who are low income and students who were upper income, from upper-income families, there was a four-grade-level difference in learning between those students. \\nToday, that difference is four grade levels worth of learning. We have not moved the needle whatsoever in terms of narrowing that achievement gap between poor children and their more affluent peers. We have not moved the needle in terms of graduation rates for disadvantaged children. We are still in the middle of the pack internationally. We’re not competitive internationally when we look at other countries around the world, and so the needle has essentially been flat. \\nIf you look at metrics, take for instance reading achievement among high school seniors. Reading achievement is the same today as it was when those Great Society programs passed. So on every metric that you can look at, we have not seen the needle move whatsoever in elementary and secondary education. And I should add, we have seen per-pupil federal education dollars quadruple in real terms since the Great Society launched. So a fourfold inflation-adjusted increase in spending, and we have bought with that a 137% increase in nonteaching staff. \\nSo that’s basically what we got. We got no improvement in terms of academic outcomes, but we got a public education system that saw significant nonteaching, administrative bloat in the wake of the Great Society. Evans: And Lindsey, I know you’re not an economist, but where does that money come from? Burke: I am not an economist, but I can tell you that it comes from you and me. I mean, it is taxpayer-supported, and that’s a really interesting segue I think into the higher ed component and the impact of the Great Society. Prior to the Great Society initiative in ’65, most students paid their way to go to college and college was relatively affordable. \\nWhat we got, though, when we had massive federal subsidization after the Great Society launched, this was the Higher Education Act. It got signed into law in ’65, and for the first time it puts the full faith and credit of Uncle Sam behind private student loans. A massive increase in federal subsidies for higher ed. So what that did was that laid the groundwork for where we are today, which is a federal government that originates and services and directly provides 90% of all student loans across the country. What that means: Not only has it made college less affordable, but to quote Richard Vedder, who is an economist at the University of Ohio who also has a chapter in our book: “Basically, the federal government has been dumping money out of airplanes onto universities.”\\nAnd so of course that enables them to spend profligately. To create climbing walls and lazy rivers and tiger grottoes, to not be remotely fiscally responsible with their money because they know that they can pass that tab onto students, who get easy access to federal student loans with virtually no credit check. Then if they default or if there’s loan forgiveness, because the federal government subsidizes 90% of all student loans, that bill is paid by taxpayers when students default. \\nAnd so we’re in a really tenuous situation in higher education financing. We have $1.6 trillion in outstanding student loan debt today in America. That is breathtaking. It’s not going away anytime soon, and the policies that exist today because of the Great Society programs are what have led to that situation being the case. Allen: So we really saw the exact opposite effect … Burke: Yes. Allen: … of what it was supposed to do, right?Burke: Exactly. Evans: Interesting. Exactly. And I should say on that too, the whole Great Society initiative, a big part is the War on Poverty? Burke: It was to ostensibly help lower-income individuals climb the ladder of economic mobility. It failed in the K-12 realm, as we talked about. And in higher education, Richard Vedder in our book talks about a slightly lower proportion of low-income students today attend college than they did in 1965. So it’s failed on every measure to try to improve outcomes for low-income Americans. Allen: So where would you begin to try to fix this? It’s such a massive issue, and maybe it’s two very separate answers [on] what would fix elementary and high school versus college. What would you say to that? Burke: I think that overarching answer is the same, and we say this in our book. The first step is a bold one and it is to get the federal government out of these programs, from preschool through grad school. \\nThat it is a sort of [a] technical fix in a way, because the federal government is intrinsically involved in all education policy today. That includes having programs over at the Department of Health and Human Services. This is where Head Start is located. Of course, the federal Department of Education. There are programs over at DOD [the Department of Defense]. \\nEducation programs are everywhere in the federal government, but what we should start thinking about is how we wind down the Department of Education as a Cabinet-level agency. And for those programs that are constitutional, are performing well, where do we house those programs? Do we think about maybe Treasury can manage student loans, for instance? Do we think about putting some of these statistic reviews that the federal government currently does with the Department of Ed over at the Census Bureau? There are ways to think about how we technically wind down the department as a Cabinet-level agency. \\nRemember the Department of Education has only been around since 1980, right? It hasn’t been around forever. What that does is you sort of rebalance power over education and you start to pull that power back down to the state and local level and ultimately family level, where it belongs. Because at the end of the day, the heart of the problem with the Great Society is that it created this fundamental misalignment of power and incentives. \\nIt really shifted the locus of power of control to the federal government and out of the hands of localities and states and ultimately families. And so winding down federal intervention means putting it back in the hands of state [and] local leaders and ultimately parents. Evans: I’m glad you said that, Lindsey, because that gets into my next question. With that vacuum, as government takes up more space and leaves less space for parents to be involved … Burke: That’s right. Evans: How does that actually affect an individual student? Burke: That’s a great question and this is one of the thrusts of our book is to say, “You know, we’ve had half a century to look at the Great Society and see that it has been the Not-So-Great Society and has failed, and we need to basically rebalance to states, localities, and families and civil society at the end of the day. \\nWhen you empower civil society, that means local community options, not federal government options, you ultimately empower families because they have access to options that are situated closest to them. So it means making space for things like education choice programs to flourish at the state and local level. At the higher education level, it means getting Uncle Sam out of the student loan business so that private providers can enter the market again. We used to have a thriving private student loan market. But even better, it allows innovative options like income share agreements, for instance, to bubble up from the surface. \\nIf you look at a place like Purdue University, there are really great examples. Purdue is offering income share agreements to some of its students and basically that enables the student to pay nothing upfront for college. And Purdue, as a result of offsetting that cost upfront, knows exactly how much that student is likely to earn if they enter engineering versus another field. They can set their interest rates accordingly. And then once the student has a job, Purdue receives a portion of their income on the back end.\\nThese are innovative options that are not debt-based in the way that we’ve traditionally thought about them, and they certainly get taxpayers off the hook for financing student loans. So, we move the federal government out and we make space for civil society options like that to reemerge. Allen: I’m glad that you brought that up because one of the awesome women that we’ve celebrated on this podcast is Virginia Walden Ford. And you know her and she played such a critical role in D.C. in providing a program where students could take that little bit of money and actually apply it to going to a private school or a charter school. Are we seeing more and more of those programs emerge? Burke: You know, it’s so interesting because if we think about the Great Society, it was 1965. A few years prior to that, in 1955, we had something else come out and that was the essay written by Milton Friedman for the first time in which he formalized the idea basically of a school voucher. And it was in that 1955 essay that he said, “Let’s separate the financing of education from the delivery of services.” And so I like to think about the fact that we basically had two competing ideas moving forward, sort of in tandem, right? Milton Friedman’s idea of freedom and education, and then the top-down, heavy-handed, Great Society failure that we’ve seen. But ultimately Milton Friedman’s idea is winning out and honestly, it had remained an academic idea until about 1990. \\nWe didn’t see a lot of school choice before 1990. But then all of a sudden we get the first program [in] Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in ’91. We get a school voucher program. Then throughout the ’90s we see a couple of other programs. Today, we have 63 private school choice programs in 29 states and in D.C. And Virginia Walden Ford is really … we call her the mother of the D.C. voucher program. It was because of her that that program began in Washington, D.C., in 2003, and it is not hyperbolic to say that it has saved the lives—and Virginia herself saved the lives—of thousands of D.C. children as a result. They have been able to escape failing and unsafe and unsatisfactory public schools in Washington, D.C., and attend a private school of choice where they’re safe and they’re learning and their parents are happy and they’re satisfied. \\nThat is all because they’re able to select a school where the learning options reflect their values and their hopes and their aspirations for their lives long term. That’s sort of the student-level story of it. And when we look at the data … we’re here at President’s Club, we heard yesterday from Dr. Patrick Wolf, who’s at the University of Arkansas, he walked us through the research. When we look at the research, it is overwhelmingly positive on the benefits of school choice. … \\nThere are 16 randomized, controlled trial evaluations that look at the impact of school choice on academic achievement, and 10 of those find statistically significant improvements for students. We have four that have no effects, so no difference between public and private school choice options. And then two that have negative effects. But those two were both from Louisiana, which is a uniquely heavily regulated state. I say all that to say the impact of school choice, the literature shows it is positive on balance, that kids are performing phenomenally as a result. That’s all because we’re putting power in the hands of parents and quite frankly, putting some much-needed competitive pressure on the public school systems to improve and to be responsive to families. Evans: So, Lindsey, a lot of our listeners are probably not quite parent age, but what is someone who’s, you know, 18, 19, 20, 25, what should they be thinking about school choice? Burke: I’m not being that much older now, but I think all the time about how our education system, just the way it operates is anathema to every other aspect of American life. Everything we do every day. \\nLike before we started this podcast a few minutes ago, somebody said, “Should I pull up the Starbucks app to put in my order?” Right? We expect customization with everything. I got here in an Uber this morning that picked me up from my house and brought me here where I needed to be in very quick order. \\nWe do everything on demand from what we watch on TV to what we order, right? We have Uber Eats. We have scooters. We have Lime, you know? Everything is just totally, totally customized, except for our education system. We assign students based on their parents’ ZIP code, which means low-income families are the ones who have the least power in that system. We assign students based on their ZIP codes, to whatever government-run school happens to be closest to where their parents can afford to live. \\nWhat else do we do that operates that way? The post office, maybe. The DMV. That’s about it. So we have this system in education that looks more like a monopoly than a market. Much more like a monopoly than any sort of customized option everybody under 25 would demand in any other sector. I think eventually, honestly, it’s going to work itself out. Because I think the under-25 crowd is so used to that customization, that once they get to the point where they are having kids of their own and have to navigate that school system, they will be completely dumbfounded by the fact that they cannot customize it the way they customize everything else. Allen: The book is called “The Not-So-Great Society.” Lindsey, where can it be found? Burke: You can go to heritage.org/the-not-so-great-society, and you can request a copy there and it will be delivered to your door, customized and on demand. Allen: Wow, that’s so great. So convenient. Evans: Lindsey, thank you so much for joining us today. Burke: Thank you for having me.',\n",

That means, as Chingos observes, that eighth-graders are reading at a level “comparable to their counterparts of 10-20 years ago.”\\nBorrowing\\nfrom Shakespeare, education researcher\\nMatthew Ladner\\ncalls the scores for students with special needs an Agincourt-level disaster. \\nWith a few exceptions—including in school choice leader Arizona—eighth-grade math scores for children with special needs saw major declines, as this chart from Ladner shows:\\nNotably, most of the states that saw gains in this area—Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Tennessee—have education choice options, specifically for children with special needs.\\nSo,\\nwhat’s to be made of this great stagnation?\\nTaxpayers\\nhave spent some $2 trillion on K-12 education programs at the federal level,\\nwith a specific goal of narrowing achievement gaps between children from\\nlow-income families and their more affluent peers. \\nThese policies, launched as part of President Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society push, have failed to move the needle on improved education options for students, as these newest scores further demonstrate. \\nPeterson writes in The Heritage Foundation’s new book “The Not-So-Great Society”:\\nThe achievement gap in the United States is as wide today as it was in 1971. The performances on math, reading, and science tests between the most advantaged and the most disadvantaged students differ by approximately four years’ worth of learning, a disparity that has remained essentially unchanged for nearly half a century.\\nFederal per-pupil K-12 education spending has quadrupled in real\\nterms since the 1960s.

Burke researches and writes on federal and state education issues as the Will Skillman fellow in education policy at The Heritage Foundation. Read her research.\\n“Dismal.” “A train wreck.” That’s how people have characterized the results of this year’s National Assessment of Educational Progress.\\nThe NAEP assesses fourth and eighth-graders’ performance in reading and math every other year. Test results had been trending upward since the early 1990s, but the results released last month indicated a drop in both math and reading among middle-schoolers nationally. Nevada students didn’t fare any better.\\nThe state’s students have consistently performed well below the national average. Among the 50 states, Nevada fourth-graders now rank 45th in math and 44th in reading. Eighth-graders rank 42nd and 43rd, respectively.\\nEqually troubling is the lack of improvement among minority and low-income students in Nevada. Nationwide, the achievement gap between students who are eligible for free or reduced-price lunch and those who aren’t eligible has been narrowing. In Nevada, the gap has remained unchanged since 2000.\\nBut this year, legislators gave Nevadans hope that they could turn the table on lackluster academic improvement: They passed the nation’s first near-universal Education Savings Account program. Now\\xa0every child who has attended a public school in the state for at least 100 days can get access to an account\\xa0that amounts to 90 percent of what the state would have spent on the child in his previous school, or about $5,100. And children from low-income families or with special needs will have access to accounts worth 100 percent of that amount—roughly $5,700.\\nThis money can be used for tuition at a private school of choice, or it can be used to completely customize a child’s education. ESA funds can pay for private tutors, online learning options, special education therapies and services, textbooks, curricula, and Advanced Placement tests, among a variety of other education-related services and products. The customization opportunities are endless and represent a watershed moment for education in Nevada.\\nThe new ESA option will empower families to access quality education options—particularly low-income families who have had very few choices in the past. Yet, in a state that ranks near the bottom in reading and math,\\xa0the American Civil Liberties Union has filed a lawsuit to stop this promising innovation in its tracks.\\nThe lawsuit relies in part on a 19th-century relic known as the “Blaine Amendment”—originally established to blunt the growth of Catholic schooling. The amendment’s roots are well-documented as being anti-Catholic and anti-immigrant. Indeed, as the U.S. Supreme Court acknowledged in Mitchell v. Helms, the effort had “a shameful pedigree. … Consideration of the amendment arose at a time of pervasive hostility to the Catholic Church and to Catholics in general.”\\nThe ACLU is on the wrong side of history in using Blaine to thwart this modern-day education choice option.\\nNevada’s Blaine Amendment reads: “no public funds of any kind or character whatever, State, county or Municipal, shall be used for sectarian purpose.” But, as the Institute for Justice notes, the language does not apply to “publicly funded educational assistance programs like Nevada’s ESA Program” and “does not constrain the private choices of private individuals.”\\nFoes of ESAs have lodged a second objection as well: that the accounts violate the state’s obligation to pay for a uniform system of public schools. Yet the ESA option does no such thing. Instead, as the Institute for Justice observes, just like charter and magnet schools, ESAs simply provide for additional education options on top of the existing public school system.\\nAs the new NAEP numbers demonstrate, Nevada has a lot of room for improvement. ESAs may hold the key to jump-starting long-overdue reform and will have the immediate effect of enabling any family with a child in a public school who chooses to use an ESA to craft a tailor-made education for that child. That is, as long as proponents of the status quo, relying on 19th-century ignoble amendments, can stay out of the way.\\nOriginally published in The Las Vegas Review-Journal.\\nThe headline of this article has been corrected to reflect it hasn’t been 200 years since these laws were put in place.\\xa0',\n",
       " 'The Supreme Court heard oral arguments on Wednesday in a religious liberty case between a Lutheran church and the state of Missouri. (Photo: iStock Photos)\\nOn Wednesday morning, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in\\xa0Trinity Lutheran Church’s case against the state of Missouri—a case involving discrimination by the state in giving out publicly funded grants.\\nMissouri has a grant program to offset the cost of resurfacing playgrounds with rubber surfaces made from recycled tires. This helps the state reduce the number of tires in its landfills and make playgrounds safer for kids.\\nTrinity Lutheran Church applied for a grant to resurface its preschool playground. Though its application met all the neutral criteria and was rated highly, Missouri denied that application solely because it came from a church.\\nThe state claims that its constitution required it to reject the church’s request because of a “no aid” provision that prevents public money from going to churches. More than three dozen states have similar laws (known as Blaine Amendments), which were enacted during the 19th century to single out Catholic immigrants for disfavored treatment.\\nTrinity Lutheran Church argues that using state funds to ensure its playground is safe for kids is a completely secular purpose and the state’s actions demonstrate a hostility to religion.\\nCourtroom Arguments\\nAt the argument, lawyers for both sides faced a very active bench. The justices were talking over each other, trying to get in as many questions as they could in the allotted argument time.\\nIt’s no wonder—the justices had a lot of time to think about this case, since they granted review in January 2016 and appeared to hold off in hearing the case until a ninth justice was confirmed.\\nRight off the bat, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg asked David Cortman, an attorney from Alliance Defending Freedom representing Trinity Lutheran, why a 1947 case saying states don’t have to fund the building of churches doesn’t dispose of this case.\\nCortman answered that the court also said states cannot deprive churches of government benefits, and that’s just what Missouri did here. He explained that the justices should look at where the money would be going—to a secular activity.\\nWhen Justice Elena Kagan analogized this to a program to put computers in religious schools, Cortman said that this case is easier to decide because unlike computers, a playground doesn’t enable any religious activity.\\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor brought up the court’s recognition of space between the Establishment and the Free Exercise Clauses that allows states some “play in the joints.” She mentioned that Blaine Amendments—which she called an “admirable tradition” in our nation—prohibit public funds from going to churches.\\nJustice Samuel Alito asked Cortman if he agreed with Sotomayor that Blaine Amendments reflect an admirable tradition. Cortman emphatically said no, highlighting the anti-Catholic bigotry that animated the passage of many of these laws.\\nKagan then asked if Missouri’s action falls within this space between the two clauses.\\nCortman explained that while states have tremendous leeway in how they set up programs such as this (e.g. only for public schools), Missouri was clearly singling out churches for disfavored treatment—something the “play in the joints” does not allow.\\nSome of the justices were clearly concerned about how far states could take these “no aid” provisions. Justice Stephen Breyer repeatedly pressed the lawyer representing Missouri, James Layton, on whether states could decline to offer police and fire protection to churches.\\nLayton explained that since those benefits are offered to everyone, there wouldn’t be a concern about the state getting entangled in the business of a church or being seen as endorsing a church (both aspects of the Supreme Court’s convoluted Establishment Clause jurisprudence).\\nIn selective programs, such as the recycled tire grant program, Layton maintained that the state could make the decision to exclude churches in order to sidestep any Establishment Clause concerns.\\nBreyer asked about crossing guards, since they aren’t placed everywhere, and Layton simply said this case is different because it involves physical improvement to the church’s property.\\nAlito asked whether the state could disqualify religious students from a scholarship program based on academic credentials after the fact if too many religious students were earning the scholarship. Layton admitted that would pose an equal protection problem.\\nChief Justice John Roberts asked if the state could offer tours of its capitol building to student groups, but exclude groups from religious schools. Layton replied that this would be another example of a universal benefit, so the state’s concerns about entanglement with a church would not be valid.\\nJustice Neil Gorsuch came back to this universal/selective distinction later, asking why discrimination based on religious status is permissible in a selective program, but not in a universal program.\\nLayton fell back on the claim that since this involved a physical improvement to Trinity Lutheran’s property, it’s on the wrong side of the line and looks like state endorsement of religion.\\nKagan pointed out that the state’s entanglement and endorsement concerns would need to rise to a high level in order to burden the constitutional rights of its citizens, as it did with Trinity Lutheran.\\nIn his brief rebuttal, Cortman pointed out that there is no endorsement problem here because the state set out neutral, secular criteria for its grant program—criteria that Trinity Lutheran met.\\nHe also took issue with the state’s characterization that giving a one-time grant to the church would constitute entanglement. He explained that entanglement requires the state’s ongoing, intrusive involvement with a church—something that simply would not occur if Trinity Lutheran received this grant.\\nAn issue lingering in the background was the Missouri governor’s eleventh hour decision to announce on Facebook that going forward, he will not exclude churches from this grant program.\\nThis would not, however, change the outcome for Trinity Lutheran. The church could apply for the grant a second time, but there are no guarantees that the governor won’t change his mind in the future.\\nSo, that’s not enough for the Supreme Court to choose not to decide this case.\\nNext Steps\\nNow, the justices will deliberate and issue an opinion by the end of the court’s term in June.\\nBased on the questions at argument today, a number of the justices appeared to be concerned about the state’s lack of a limiting principle on excluding religiously affiliated groups from state grant programs.\\nIf Trinity Lutheran wins the day, it will be a signal to states that they may not discriminate against churches under the guise of Blaine Amendments.',\n",

Indeed, he concluded, “the general principles here do not permit discrimination against religious exercise—whether on the playground or anywhere else.”\\n>>> Stay up to date with the latest at the Supreme Court by checking out SCOTUS 101, a new podcast hosted by Heritage Foundation scholars Elizabeth Slattery and Tiffany Bates.\\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a dissenting opinion, which Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined, arguing that today’s decision weakens the separation of church and state.\\nIn their view, allowing a church to apply for a grant like Missouri’s scrap tires program violates the Establishment Clause because “[w]hen a government funds a house of worship, it underwrites this religious exercise.”\\nSotomayor expressed her concern that this decision makes the “separation of church and state … a constitutional slogan, not a constitutional commitment.”\\nBut in fact, that famous phrase is not part of the Constitution, and certainly would not allow states to “impose special disabilities on the basis of … religious status.”\\nThe so-called “wall of separation” comes from President Thomas Jefferson’s letter to the Danbury Baptist Association, but it’s worth pointing out that Jefferson approved of using federal funds to build churches.\\nThis dissent highlights the fact that some people (and at least two justices) believe religious believers need to stay out of the public square and effectively check their beliefs at the door before entering the secular world.\\nThankfully, the Constitution protects the freedom to believe what you want and live out those beliefs, and on Monday, religious freedom prevailed at the Supreme Court.',\n",
       " 'A Maryland school has been banned from a state voucher program due to its faith-based views on gay marriage and transgenderism. (Photo: Lane Turner/The Boston Globe/Getty Images)\\n\\nNicole Russell\\n/\\n@russell_nm\\n\\nNicole Russell is a contributor to The Daily Signal. Her work has appeared in The Atlantic, The New York Times, National Review, Politico, The Washington Times, The American Spectator, and Parents Magazine.\\nOfficials in the state of Maryland have banned a school from their voucher program due to its faith-based views on gay marriage and transgenderism. The Baltimore Sun reported that Bethel Christian Academy responded to the ban with a lawsuit contending officials violated its religious freedom.\\nThe case will now be heard in federal court\\nAccording to the complaint filed in June, the voucher program in Maryland—Broadening Options and Opportunities for Students—launched in the 2016-2017 school year and benefits low-income students, allowing them to attend private schools they otherwise may be unable to afford. \\nThe state instituted a ban on Bethel Christian\\nAcademy after sifting through the handbooks of nearly 180 schools that\\nparticipated in the voucher program. Of those, nearly 20 were deemed ineligible\\ndue to discriminatory language in their handbooks, including Bethel. \\nThough Bethel Christian Academy espouses traditional Christian beliefs about marriage and sexuality, the school has not disqualified a student from attending based on sexual orientation. Officials required the school to reimburse the state for its participation in the program prior to the ban, which it did.\\xa0 \\nIn 2018,\\nMatthew Gallagher, chairman of an advisory board that oversees the vouchers,\\nwrote the school saying the state viewed its policy as discriminatory. \\nThe\\nlawsuit says Gallagher wrote, “A non-heterosexual student may reasonably view\\nthe policy as one that allows denial of admission or discipline or expulsion on\\nthe basis of his or her sexual orientation. Therefore, the Board concluded that\\nthis policy, on its face, was in conflict with the nondiscrimination clause\\ncontained in the … law.”\\nThe Christian school opposed the state’s ban and said Maryland’s decision infringed on its First Amendment right to religious freedom. \\n“The Supreme Court has been very clear that there is no place in our society for religious hostility,” said Christiana Holcomb, the school’s legal counsel, according to The Baltimore Sun. “That is the crux of the issue of this case.” \\nHolcomb said that Bethel is no longer able to participate in the voucher program because of Bethel’s Judeo-Christian beliefs about marriage. \\nThe intersection of religious freedom and civil rights is the latest sticky set of legal issues the nation is contending with as LGBT causes are increasingly being litigated at all levels of the judiciary. However unusual this particular case might seem—it certainly hasn’t made a big splash in the news—the Supreme Court agreed to hear oral arguments for a similar case, Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue, on Jan. 22.\\xa0\\xa0 \\nIn that case, low-income children in Montana are no longer able to participate in a scholarship program if they choose to “spend” their voucher attending a religious school.\\nEven though Montana’s state legislature passed the Tax Credit Scholarship Program in 2015—which would have allowed Montana citizens a modest credit of $150 to a private scholarship program—the Montana Department of Revenue refused to implement the program. \\nIts reason? The Blaine Amendment, something at least some legal scholars believe is a 19th-century law, steeped in bigotry, and which also happens to ban tax credits going to schools with a religious affiliation. \\nIn its amicus brief filed on behalf of the case, the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a nonprofit, argued that the Blaine Amendment violated the First Amendment rights of the citizens of Montana. It makes a persuasive case that all Blaine Amendments are anti-Catholic, and thus unconstitutional under the Free Exercise Clause of the Constitution.\\nIt’s clear this is a government-led campaign\\nagainst faith-based schools, and an even more discreet campaign against school\\nchoice. \\nSchool choice is a valuable aspect of our\\neducation system. \\nResearch shows that for many students, when they’re able to exercise choice, their outcomes improve and society as a whole benefits. As such, states with school choice programs should not be able to exclude religious schools from participating—it’s a violation of students’ rights. \\nThe concept that schools can only participate\\nin the state voucher program only if they are completely secular is also a\\nbogus claim: A state is not establishing a religion just because it’s aiding\\nstudents in their ability to attend a school with religious beliefs. \\nWhile it’s not clear how the Supreme Court will decide on Espinoza or what the implications of a ruling may be, it is clear that states should refrain from this targeted attack on religious schools, under the guise of ensuring discrimination is nonexistent. \\nEspousing religious beliefs is not a form of\\ndiscrimination nor is the state’s creation of school choice programs an attempt\\nto establish a religion.',\n",

During\\nthe court’s January sitting, the justices will hear arguments in eight cases,\\nincluding ones dealing with school choice and the “Bridgegate” scandal. \\nThe\\njustices already have heard arguments in cases involving the Second Amendment,\\nObamacare, and whether federal law covers claims of discrimination based on\\ngender identity and sexual orientation. \\nLater in\\nthe term, the court will take up cases involving the president’s ability to\\nfire the head of an “independent” agency, regulation of abortion providers, and\\nthe dispute over a subpoena for President Donald Trump’s financial records. \\nHere are\\ntwo key cases coming up in January. \\nThe first\\ncase, Kelly v. United States, is set for oral argument Tuesday. \\nIn September 2013, the George Washington Bridge—called the busiest bridge in the world, connecting Fort Lee, New Jersey, and Manhattan—faced major traffic delays. \\nIn a scandal\\nlater known as “Bridgegate,” a four-day traffic jam turned out to be a plan\\nconcocted by aides to then-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to punish Fort Lee’s\\nmayor for refusing to endorse Christie’s reelection bid. \\nPursuant to\\na deal struck by the state and city decades ago, the Port Authority of New York\\nand New Jersey designated three of the 12 inbound lanes as “special access lanes”\\nfor traffic coming from Fort Lee into Manhattan during the morning rush hour. \\nBeginning Sept. 9, 2013, the first day of the new school year, Port Authority police reduced the special access lanes to one. The resulting traffic jam created gridlock throughout Fort Lee for the next three days. Pleas from the mayor to the Port Authority went unanswered. \\nDuring a subsequent investigation into Bridgegate, the governor’s aides claimed the lane changes were part of a traffic study. But an email from deputy chief of staff Bridget Anne Kelly made the plan clear: It was “[t]ime for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.” \\nKelly and Bill Baroni, deputy executive director of the Port Authority, were both fired and later convicted of seven federal crimes.\\xa0 \\nOn appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit affirmed their convictions for wire fraud and defrauding a federally funded program, finding that Kelly and Baroni deprived the Port Authority of its property by concealing their real reason (political retribution) for an otherwise permissible act. \\nThe issue\\nbefore the Supreme Court is whether Kelly and Baroni defrauded the government\\nof property by claiming a public policy reason supported an official decision\\nwhen that was not the real reason for the decision. \\nThey admit\\ntheir actions were “petty, insensitive, and ill-advised,” but argue that “political abuses of power are addressed politically.” They contend that hiding\\nthe political motives for an otherwise permissible act did not deprive the Port\\nAuthority of its property. \\nKelly and Baroni encourage the Supreme Court not to criminalize political “spin” and instead follow the line of past cases in which the justices have “rebuffed efforts to use criminal fraud laws to police the ethical duty of public officials.” \\nIn 2015, the Montana Legislature created a tax credit scholarship program that would provide scholarships for income-eligible students to use at qualified private schools. \\nInitially, recipients could use scholarship funds at qualified religiously affiliated schools. However, the Montana Department of Revenue implemented an administrative rule excluding religious schools, citing a\\xa0provision in the state constitution that bars state funds from aiding religious organizations. \\nParents who\\nrelied on the scholarship funds to send their kids to religious schools filed a\\nlawsuit in state court challenging the administrative rule. They argued that\\nthe rule violates the Religion Clauses of the U.S. Constitution as well as the 14th\\nAmendment’s Equal Protection Clause. \\nThe parents\\nmaintain that the tax credit program did not violate the state constitution’s\\n“no aid” provision since the tax credit merely incentivized private donations.\\nThe district court ruled in favor of the parents, but the Montana Supreme Court\\nreversed and invalidated the scholarship program in its entirety. \\nNow the\\nparents have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to extend the logic of Trinity Lutheran Church v. Comer, a 2017 ruling, to the school\\nchoice area.\\nIn Trinity Lutheran, the Supreme Court ruled that Missouri violated the Free Exercise Clause when it barred a church-run day care center from receiving a public grant to resurface its playground. The justices reasoned that Missouri had improperly singled out the day care center for unfavorable treatment and denied it a public benefit solely because of its religious affiliation. \\nThe parents\\nalso point out that the Supreme Court has drawn a distinction between\\ngovernment directly providing aid to religious schools and providing aid to\\nindividuals who then have the choice to use those funds at religious schools. \\nMontana, on\\nthe other hand, points to Locke v. Davey (2004), in which\\nthe Supreme Court held that, consistent with the Establishment Clause, states\\ncould prohibit the use of public scholarship funds for college students\\nstudying to become ministers. \\nThe Montana case offers the Supreme Court the chance to harmonize these two prior rulings and provide guidance to the many states that have tax credit scholarships.\\nThe court will hear oral argument Jan. 22. \\nExpect the\\nhigh court’s decisions in these two important cases, and many others, by the\\nend of June. \\n>>>\\xa0Listen\\nto “SCOTUS 101,” a podcast with Elizabeth Slattery and friends that brings you\\nup to speed on what’s happening at the Supreme Court.',\n",
       " 'A 40-foot cross  honoring 49 fallen World War I soldiers from Prince George’s County stands at the busy intersection of Bladensburg and Annapolis roads and Baltimore Avenue in this photo taken Feb. 28 in Bladensburg, Maryland.  (Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\\nThe Supreme Court ruled 7-2 Thursday that a cross-shaped war memorial on public land in Maryland doesn’t violate the Constitution. \\nIn the case of American Legion v. the American Humanist Association, the atheist group had sued seeking removal of the 40-foot Peace Cross in Prince George’s County—just outside Washington, D.C.—contending that the World War I memorial was contrary to the separation of church and state.\\nHowever, a supermajority on a court that is often closely divided on hot-button issues determined the history of the Peace Cross erected in Bladensburg, Maryland, doesn’t indicate it promoted a religion, Christianity, in honoring 49 local men who died in the war.\\n“For nearly a century, the Bladensburg Cross has expressed the community’s grief at the loss of the young men who perished, its thanks for their sacrifice, and its dedication to the ideals for which they fought,” Justice Samuel Alito wrote in the majority opinion for the court. \\nAlito went on to quote Justice Stephen Breyer’s words from a previous case also hinging on the Constitution’s Establishment Clause. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“It has become a prominent community landmark, and its removal or radical alteration at this date would be seen by many not as a neutral act but as the manifestation of ‘a hostility toward religion that has no place in our Establishment Clause traditions,’” Alito wrote. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nChief Justice John Roberts and Justices Elena Kagan, Brett Kavanaugh, Clarence Thomas, and Neil Gorsuch joined Alito and Breyer in the majority. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor dissented.\\nThe Trump administration’s Justice Department supported keeping the Bladensburg Peace Cross, a local landmark situated in a traffic circle.\\nThe high court in its ruling shot down a 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that determined the memorial was unconstitutional, siding with plaintiffs who argued it violated the separation of church and state. \\nThe cross-shaped monument, constructed between 1919 and 1925, stands on property owned by the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, a government agency created by the state of Maryland. \\nThe American Humanist Association, representing some Prince George’s County residents, sued in 2014 to force removal of the memorial, naming both the Park and Planning Commission and the American Legion, which originally helped pay for it. \\n\\n\\n>>> Related: What Veterans Say About Effort to Remove Peace Cross War Memorial?\\n “This is a landmark victory for religious freedom.\\xa0 The days of illegitimately weaponizing the Establishment Clause and attacking religious symbols in public are over,” Kelly Shackelford, president of First Liberty, a law firm defending religious freedom that litigated the case, said in a formal statement on the ruling. \\n“Our founders would have been appalled at this attempt to make the government hostile to our religious heritage, history, and symbols,” Shackelford said. \\nThe American Humanist Association said it would move to limit the scope of the ruling. \\n“In the face of today’s decision, we must all pursue new avenues to bolster the First Amendment,” Executive Director Roy Speckhardt said in a prepared statement. “Our legislative efforts will be redoubled as the American Humanist Association works to strengthen the wall of separation between church and state, brick by brick. And in the interim, our legal team will do what it can to narrow the breadth of this decision in courtrooms across the country.” \\nThe high court ruling marked a win for all Americans, said Emilie Kao, director of the DeVos Center for Religion and Civil Society at The Heritage Foundation. \\n“The founders envisioned a public square where Americans of all faiths, and even those with no faith, would be free to express their beliefs,” Kao said in a written statement. \\n“Throughout our history, Americans have used religious symbols to commemorate meaningful events—from legislative prayer to observing holidays and expressing the principles of justice,” she said.\\nBut, Kao added, the Supreme Court could have done more. \\n“While the court decided this case correctly, it did not clarify its own confusing and contradictory standards for deciding other Establishment Clause cases. Even though four justices criticized the long-discredited 1971 decision in Lemon v. Kurtzman and its ‘shortcomings,’ they did not vote to overturn this distortion of the Constitution,” Kao said.\\n“The Constitution as written, not the personal views of judges, should guide how the American people express their religious faith in the public square.” \\nThis report has been updated to include comments on the ruling.',\n",
       " 'The Supreme Court will decide whether to allow a cross-shaped memorial to World War I soldiers to survive on property maintained by a government agency in Bladensburg, Maryland. (Photo: Mark Gail for The Washington Post/Getty Images)\\n\\nEmilie Kao\\n/\\n@EmilieTHF\\n\\nEmilie Kao is director of the Richard and Helen DeVos Center for Religion & Civil Society at The Heritage Foundation.\\nOne of the most\\nprofound differences between the American and French views of religious freedom\\nis our treatment of religious symbols in the public square. \\nAmerica’s Founders\\nenvisioned a public square that is neither secular nor sacred. In contrast, France\\nhas enacted policies that advance radical secularism. \\nFrench law has erased\\nreligious symbols from public view under a policy of secularism known as laïcité.\\nIn 2004, the French government banned students from wearing religious symbols such\\nas yarmulkes, crosses, and hijabs (Muslim headscarves) in classrooms. \\nLast year, the\\nFrench government relocated a statue\\nof Pope John Paul II, which included a cross, from public to private land\\xa0after a\\nhumanist organization sued.\\xa0 \\nThe goal of laïcité was\\nto foster social harmony\\nbetween different groups in a multicultural, multifaith society. But in\\npractice, the policy failed. Empowering the government to investigate and\\nsuppress religious expression has only exacerbated religious division. \\nNow the U.S. Supreme Court is faced with the same issue—whether to allow a cross-shaped memorial to World War I soldiers to survive on property that is maintained by an agency created by the state of Maryland.\\nIn 1923, the American Legion worked with Gold Star Mothers to erect the Peace Cross memorial with private funds on private property in Bladensburg, Maryland. The memorial bears the American Legion’s symbol, a plaque with the names of 49 local soldiers who gave their lives, and the words “Valor, Endurance, Courage, Devotion.” \\nOver the years, as the town of Bladensburg developed, the Peace Cross ended up in the middle of a traffic circle in Veterans Memorial Park alongside other commemorative symbols. \\nThen, the American Humanist Association filed a lawsuit in 2014 on behalf of three plaintiffs who regularly drove by the Peace Cross and said they were psychologically offended by its presence. A lower court granted “standing” to the humanists, despite Supreme Court precedent that rejected the “offended observer” test.\\nDuring oral argument Feb. 27 at the Supreme Court, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg also highlighted the potential for the Peace Cross to “offend” those of other faiths. She pointed out that Americans are different now than we were during World War I, noting that at least 30 percent of Americans are now non-Christians. \\nThe American Humanist\\nAssociation’s lawyer described the Peace Cross as “too loud” and “too offensive,”\\nstating that when Jews, Muslims, and humanists saw the war memorial, they\\n“processed” it as a message that they are inferior and that their military\\nservice is not valued.\\xa0 \\nBut when Chief Justice John Roberts reminded the lawyer that one of the fundraisers for the Peace Cross was Jewish, she dismissed his view as that of only one person.\\n >>> Related: 6 Key Exchanges From the Peace Cross Oral Argument\\nJustices Stephen\\nBreyer and Neil Gorsuch both reminded the courtroom of America’s legacy of\\nreligious pluralism.\\n“[A]ll our\\nliberties come from freedom of religion,” Breyer said. “You have your religion.\\nI have mine. We are not going to kill each other.” \\nGorsuch noted that\\nin America other people’s views must be tolerated, and\\npeople must learn to deal with offense. He warned that involving\\nthe government in censoring offensive speech would be to “dictate taste.” \\nRoberts pointed out the existence of diverse religious symbols on\\npublic property throughout the country, describing Native American totem poles\\nwith spiritual meaning on public lands. \\nIn New York City, public schools display both the Jewish menorah and the Muslim crescent. And of public schools’ observance of Muslim religious holidays, Mayor Bill de Blasio said it was “a commonsense change and one that recognizes our growing Muslim community and honors its contributions to our city.” \\nOther cases invoking the Constitution’s establishment clause have involved Jewish eruvs on public utility poles. An eruv demarcates an area where an adherent of Judaism may walk on the Sabbath to get to synagogue and is allowed to carry certain objects. \\nAdditionally, public servants have won the right to wear religious dress as they carry out their duties. Recently, the House of Representatives changed its rules on head coverings to accommodate Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., who wears a hijab. Similarly, Sikh soldiers have won the right to wear a turban. \\nAs the Jewish\\nCoalition for Religious Liberty noted, when the government allows\\noffense to limit the public presence of religious symbols, religious minorities\\nare the most likely to suffer. The public’s unfamiliarity with the symbols of\\nreligious minorities are more likely to feed “distrust, suspicion, and even\\nhostility” toward them.\\nThe totem pole, the eruv, the crescent moon: Each of these symbols\\ncould cause offense to someone. According to the historic American\\nunderstanding of freedom, however, the government doesn’t take anything away\\nfrom anyone by allowing a symbol (secular or religious) merely to exist in the\\npublic square. \\nBut\\nwhen the government censors symbols just because they are religious, pluralism necessarily\\nsuffers. \\nThe\\nFounders recognized that we are not a\\ncountry of irreligious people. Nor are we a people who follow one religion. We\\nare a people who follow many religions. \\nAnd although the establishment clause prevents the government from elevating one religion above all others through coercion or exclusion, that’s not what the Peace Cross in Bladensburg does. \\nOur history, our pluralistic\\nidentity, and the future of both majority and minority faiths are at stake in\\nthis case. America’s unique path has enabled peaceful pluralism to flourish as\\nour country has become more religiously diverse. \\nThe Supreme Court\\nshould honor our constitutional tradition by allowing the public square to be\\nfull of symbols that reflect our diversity.

(Photo: NurPhoto/Getty Images)\\n\\nEmilie Kao\\n/\\n@EmilieTHF\\n\\nEmilie Kao is director of the Richard and Helen DeVos Center for Religion & Civil Society at The Heritage Foundation.\\n\\nMadison Ferguson\\n\\nMadison Ferguson is a member of the Young Leaders Program at The Heritage Foundation.\\nThe House of Representatives voted on Thursday on a resolution condemning bigotry and hate. The resolution was spurred by the recent remarks of freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn, which questioned the loyalty of Jews to the United States. \\nBoth her anti-Semitic statements and broader views of religious freedom\\ndeserve examination. \\nThe Center for American Progress recently called Omar “a champion of\\nreligious freedom.” At an event entitled “Reclaiming Religious Freedom,” Omar urged the\\nneed for “freedom, liberty, and justice for all” and bemoaned the fact that\\nsome groups in America don’t fully experience these.\\xa0 \\nShe is correct on that point. All Americans should be free to live\\naccording to their faiths without fear of government hostility, in public as\\nwell as in private—regardless of whether their beliefs are shared by elected\\nofficials.\\nBut the promise of such depends, in large measure, upon government\\nofficials demonstrating respect for the freedom of all citizens to peacefully\\nlive according to their beliefs. \\nUnfortunately, Omar’s own words and actions undermine progress toward religious freedom and justice for all.\\nPrejudice Against One Group Undermines Religious Freedom for All \\nOmar’s anti-Semitic\\ncomments suggesting that Jewish-American politicians are bought and paid for by\\nthe government of Israel have drawn rebuke from both Democrats and Republicans.\\nOmar tweeted last month, “It’s all about the Benjamins baby”—a reference to $100 bills. \\nShe went on to state her belief that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee pays Jewish-American members of Congress to take pro-Israel stances.  \\nThis statement echoed her earlier tweet: “Israel has hypnotized the world. May Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel.” \\nOmar\\xa0has also voiced her support for the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement (BDS) that aims to change Israeli policy toward the Palestinian population through economic pressure.\\nAnti-Semitism is\\nreligious prejudice. Jews have a multifaceted identity that includes culture,\\nethnicity, and religion. And while many Jews are secular, anti-Semitism targets\\nJews as a whole and helps foment hostility toward Jewish religious beliefs, practices,\\nand identity. \\nIt is no coincidence that the anti-Semitic terrorist who took the lives of 11 Jews at the Tree of Life synagogue outside Pittsburgh chose to attack them at their house of prayer on the Sabbath—a day set aside for rest, religious observance, and celebration.\\nUnfortunately, anti-Semitism is on the rise not only around the world, but also in the United States. The Anti-Defamation League reported a 60 percent increase in anti-Semitic attacks in 2017. \\nThe FBI also recorded that Jews were the most targeted group for religious hate crimes. Of the 1,749 victims of anti-religious hate crimes, 58.1 percent were “victims of crimes motivated by their offenders’ anti-Jewish bias”—even though Jews represent only 2.2 percent of the American population. \\nWhen a member of Congress suggests that a religious group\\nhas dual loyalty to an external power, it creates a chilling effect for all\\nmembers of the community to express their identity in public. That was true in\\nthe 1960s when critics accused\\nJohn F. Kennedy of dual loyalty to the Vatican, and it would be true if Omar\\nwere accused of dual loyalty to Muslim governments. \\nEvery person of faith, every person who cares about\\nreligious freedom, and every member of Congress should stand up and speak out\\nagainst anti-Semitism. World history shows that prejudice toward Jews is not easily\\ncontained, but can quickly spread. \\xa0\\nExpressions of religious prejudice from government officials can foment religious bigotry within society as a whole, and an attitude of “religious freedom for me, but not for thee.” Omar’s anti-Semitic statements reveal a dangerously misguided understanding of religious freedom. \\nReligious Freedom Protects Actions, Not Just Appearances\\nAt the beginning of this\\ncongressional term, the House changed its ban on headwear in the House gallery.\\nOmar was the catalyst for that change. It enables her to continue her Muslim\\npractice of wearing a hijab while serving in public office. \\nAt the Center for American Progress, she stated that she “visually presents her faith.” But she then undermined her view by denouncing the freedom of Christian adoption agencies to serve according to their religious beliefs. \\nOmar was referring to the\\ndecision of the Department of Health and Human Services to grant a waiver to\\nthe state of South Carolina that enabled Miracle Hill Ministries to continue\\nserving foster children. The waiver, issued under the Obama administration, allows\\nMiracle Hill and other religious agencies to place foster children with parents\\nthat share their own faith. \\nThe Constitution protects\\nthis freedom as central to religious liberty. And it is a freedom that reflects\\nreligious solidarity—not a rejection of outsiders.\\nAs Howard Slugh, founder of\\nJewish Coalition for Religious Liberty, has written, “Bonds\\nbetween members of the same faith rest on shared beliefs; they do not indicate\\nhatred of outsiders.” \\xa0\\nSlugh compared Miracle Hill’s stance to\\nefforts by American Jews to find Jewish families\\nfor Jewish children fleeing persecution in Russia during the 1980s and 1990s,\\nnoting that the “position [was not] based on spite or hatred.\\nReligious solidarity is the motivation.”\\nAmerica is currently struggling with a\\nshortage of foster parents to care for the more than 437,500 children on the\\nwaiting list. Government authorities need help from a broad diversity of\\nagencies in meeting this need. \\nSecular and religious child welfare\\nagencies play distinct roles. Faith-based agencies are uniquely suited to\\nrecruit families from their own communities—whether Christians, Jewish, or\\nMuslim—and to provide these loving families with spiritual care and support. \\nDuring\\nthis year’s National Prayer Breakfast, President Donald Trump acknowledged the\\nthreat to religious liberty and pushed back by pledging that faith-based\\nagencies should be “free to follow their deeply held beliefs.”\\n\\nThis robust vision of religious freedom contrasts sharply with Omar, who was hailed at the Center for American Progress as someone who brings “faith into public policymaking and public service,” despite her own comment that we shouldn’t “externally practice our faith.”  \\nBut an understanding of religious freedom that is limited to visual representation is remarkably impoverished. Religious freedom is more than wearing a hijab or carrying a rosary. It extends beyond prayer rugs and pews. Our Constitution protects our freedom to work and to serve according to our faiths in the public square. \\nReligious Freedom Matters Most When We Disagree\\nIn stark contrast to Omar,\\nanother Democratic congresswoman has courageously spoken up for religious\\nfreedom for all Americans, including in the workplace.\\xa0 \\nWhen Sens. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, questioned a Nebraska judicial nominee about his fitness to serve because of his membership in the Knights of Columbus, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, a practicing Hindu, rose to his defense. \\nShe criticized the inquiries into his membership in the Catholic service organization citing Article VI of the Constitution, which bars “religious tests” for those seeking public office.\\nGabbard wrote, “We\\nmust call this out for what it is—religious bigotry.\\xa0This is true not just\\nwhen such prejudice is anti-Catholic, but also when it is anti-Semitic,\\nanti-Muslim, anti-Hindu, or anti-Protestant, or any other religion.” \\nAmid the growing\\nconfusion in Congress over the constitutionality of religious tests, Gabbard’s\\nvoice was a welcome call for equal treatment and the freedom to live according\\nto our beliefs in every sphere, not just in worship. \\nShe echoed President\\nGeorge Washington, who wrote to the Newport Hebrew Congregation in 1790, “All\\npossess alike liberty of conscience and immunities of citizenship.” \\nOur commitments to\\nreligious freedom are most deeply tested when we are asked to protect the\\nfreedom of those whose beliefs are different from our own. \\nOmar’s anti-Semitism, impoverished view of religious\\nfreedom, and intolerance toward religious differences must not become the new normal in Congress—or\\nanywhere. \\nAs Democrats and\\nRepublicans settle into their roles in the 116th Congress, our representatives should\\nwork to fulfill the promise of religious freedom for all Americans.

(Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\\n\\nEmilie Kao\\n/\\n@EmilieTHF\\n\\nEmilie Kao is director of the Richard and Helen DeVos Center for Religion & Civil Society at The Heritage Foundation.\\nLike a strong cocktail that promises a quick buzz, social media\\noffers us instant gratification that can be hard to resist. \\nBut just as alcohol disguises the smell of chemicals, social\\nmedia hides the bitter poison of identity politics—a poison that increasingly\\ndominates the content we read. \\nThis toxic cocktail is killing our freedom to speak the truth. And\\nsadly, some of the world’s most powerful companies are siding against freedom\\nand truth.\\nTwitter’s latest move against free thought came in the form of a\\nban on “misgendering” and “deadnaming.” This essentially means users who use pronouns\\nand names that align with a person’s biology rather than their professed gender\\nidentity will be punished. \\nThis is a victory of feelings over facts. Big tech is enabling identity politics to dominate the virtual public square—and it’s even aiding its takeover of the real one, too. \\nTake the United\\nKingdom. In England, police have already used tweets to investigate and arrest\\ncitizens for referring to individuals according to their biology rather than\\ntransgender ideology. In two separate incidents, police responded to complaints\\nagainst women from men who identify as women. \\nPolice arrested Kate Scottow at home in front of her children and then held her in a jail cell for seven hours after transgender activist Anthony Halliday\\xa0(aka Stephanie Hayden) accused her of “misgendering” him. \\nHalliday/Hayden also seemed to suggest that transgender activists ought to “[storm] into” a parish church to ask “robust questions” of a priest’s wife who has opposed transgender ideology.\\nStephanie thinks I need robust questioning over my beliefs. After their friend Dr Harrop tried to intimidate me by tweeting photos of our church & saying they would come here, they think they are justified in storming a church because they don’t like the priest’s wife’s views. pic.twitter.com/nxM1wUfKI1\\nPolice also went after a 74-year–old woman named Margaret Nelson. The reason: She posted two statements on Twitter that didn’t accord with transgender ideology: “gender is fashionable nonsense” and “in life or in death, trans women are not women, no matter how many times you say it’s so.” \\nForced to Speak Untruths\\nIn the novel “1984,” George\\nOrwell coined the phrase “Big Brother is watching” to refer to the government.\\nToday, he’d have to include social media companies as enforcers. \\nTwitter’s ban on “misgendering”\\nand “deadnaming” crosses a red line. Twitter users should be able to choose what\\npronouns and names they use for each other. When Twitter punishes users for misgendering\\nand deadnaming, the company pressures us to speak untruths. \\nPrinceton University professor\\nRobert George has warned,\\n“Ordinary authoritarians are content to forbid people from saying things they\\nknow or believe to be true. Totalitarians insist on forcing people to say\\nthings they know or believe to be untrue.”\\nSocial media companies’ embrace of identity politics has led to biased enforcement of content standards that favors transgender activists. \\nIn Canada, for instance, feminist journalist Meghan Murphy testified before the Canadian Senate against the notorious Bill C-16, which added “misgendering” to the human rights code and criminal code in May 2017. In August 2018, Twitter told her to delete tweets that referred to a biological man, Ryan Kreut (who self-identifies as a woman named Lisa), as a man. \\nThen, last November, Murphy tweeted several rhetorical questions: “How are transwomen not men? What is the difference between a man and a transwoman?” She referred to transgender activist Jonathan Yaniv according to his biology. In the past he had filed lawsuits against female beauticians who refused to give him “bikini waxes.”\\nTwitter classified these statements from Murphy as hateful and permanently shut down her account. Yaniv then bragged\\xa0that he was personally responsible for getting Murphy banned from Twitter.\\nMurphy is now suing Twitter over the ban.\\nCompanies like Twitter clearly see themselves as defending transgender individuals. But they are much more passive about enforcing “hateful conduct” policies when it comes to protecting women from transgender activists. \\nTrans activists frequently target Murphy and others by name, referring to them as trans-exclusionary radical feminists (TERFs). A website called terfisaslur.com displays tweets like “All TERFs deserve to be shot in the head.” “All TERFS need to cease existing. Wipe them from the earth.” \\nTransgender activists have also targeted Kaeley Triller, co-founder\\nof Hands Across the Aisle, a coalition of women opposed to transgender ideology,\\non Facebook by posting her home address and violently threatening her children. \\n“Ironically,” Triller says, “the least ‘safe spaces’ in the\\nhistory of the world are spaces where speech is censored and dissent is\\npunished. If people are not safe to disagree, they are not safe at all.” \\nSocial media companies\\ncould be protecting women from the violent, graphic, and threatening content against\\nfeminists documented at terfisaslur.com, but instead, Twitter is “protecting”\\nthose who identify as transgender from the “hateful conduct” of those who\\nsimply say that we are born male and female.\\nThe Eclipse of Women’s Rights\\nFor a brief moment during the #MeToo movement, it seemed that women were ascending the identity politics hierarchy. But as PayPal founder Peter Thiel predicted, when conflict comes between identity groups, the solution will be brokered in a way that most benefits the left as a coalition, not any particular group. \\nTwitter and Facebook’s double standards are proving Thiel\\ncorrect. Transgenderism is making war on feminism, and feminists are losing\\nout.\\nIdentity politics is poisonous to freedom. It divides Americans up\\nby ethnicity, race, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, etc., and ranks\\nus in a hierarchy based upon degrees of “victimization.” \\nThis is deeply out of step with America’s founding, which\\nchampioned the legal equality of each citizen based on inalienable natural rights.\\nIt is also out of step with the way most Americans developed their\\nidentities—from their families, religious communities, and civic groups. \\nBut as our society has become more atomized, identity politics has filled the void and offered an alternative kind of social identity—albeit a toxic one.\\nThe Marxist struggle, which originally was seen as a struggle for power between economic classes, has been recast as a struggle between social identity groups. Individual guilt, virtue, and responsibility are replaced with collective guilt, virtue, and responsibility. And because this scheme treats the group as the fundamental unit of responsibility and agency, individual freedoms become irrelevant. At worst, they are seen as tools that “oppressors” can use to exploit the “oppressed.” \\nWe should not be surprised, then, when incidents of identity politics seem to reveal a totalitarian streak. Identity politics doesn’t just produce a grievance culture, it produces a vengeance culture—one that never ends and can never be resolved. \\nWhen students and faculty who hold unpopular views are shouted down or even physically assaulted, we are witnessing the fruit of a tree that is rotten to the core.\\xa0\\nIdentity politics requires the jettisoning of America’s\\nconstitutional heritage. It would ultimately replace ordered liberty with a\\nsociety in which freedoms are enjoyed only by those who have earned them\\nthrough victimization.\\nTech Giants Driving the Train\\nTwitter, Facebook, and Apple are among 107\\nmajor companies that have endorsed federal legislation that would make\\n“misgendering” a punishable offense. Named the “Equality\\nAct,” this bill is anything but.\\nState and local bureaucrats have already used similar laws and policies to derail the careers of people like high school teacher Peter Vlaming and professor Nicholas Meriwether at Shawnee State University because they referred to students according to biology and not gender ideology. \\nThese laws give government control over our freedom to speak and think according to the truth. The Equality Act would extend that to all 50 states.\\nAleksandr Solzhenitsyn, the great Russian writer who\\nsurvived life in the Soviet\\ngulag, once told the Nobel\\nPrize Committee: “One word of truth shall outweigh the whole world.” \\nAs big tech seeks to restructure both our virtual and\\nbrick-and-mortar public squares according to the frame of identity politics, now\\nmore than ever, we must fight for the freedom to use language to speak the truth.',\n",

But amid all the hubbub, President Donald\\nTrump is setting aside time to speak on a pressing issue: religious freedom and\\npersecution around the world. \\nThe president will keynote an event Monday called the Global Call to Protect Religious Freedom. This is exactly the right issue to focus on at the U.N.\\nToday, more than 80% of the world’s population\\nlives under serious restrictions of religious freedom, according to the Pew\\nResearch Center. In places like Iran, Burma, and the Chinese province of Xinjiang,\\nreligious minorities like Christians, Rohingya Muslims, and Uighur Muslims face\\nthreats to their very existence. \\nAttacks on religious believers fuel social\\ninstability, violent conflict, and the deterioration of other human rights. \\nBy calling upon all nations to protect religious freedom, the president will be giving a voice to those who too often lack one. He will also be celebrating a principle that is foundational to peace and security. \\nHis call for religious freedom is\\nparticularly needed in light of this year’s attacks on synagogues, mosques, and\\nchurches, which have claimed the lives of innocent Jews, Muslims, and\\nChristians. From Pittsburgh and San Diego to Sri Lanka and New Zealand,\\nreligious freedom is under threat. \\nIn 1948, the nations of the world pledged\\nin the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to protect every human being’s\\nfreedom to adopt or change religious belief, and to live out those beliefs in\\nthe public square in addition to private life. \\nThe U.N. has sadly strayed from this\\nheritage and, with a new initiative, has become a threat to religious freedom. \\nEarlier this year, U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres launched a Strategy and Plan of Action on Hate Speech as part of an effort to counter attacks on religious minorities. While well-intended, this effort is the wrong approach and would likely backfire.\\nThe problem with hate speech laws is that\\nthe powerful use them to redefine disagreement itself as a form of discrimination.\\nIf you hold a certain opinion that powerful elites disagree with, your speech may\\nsoon be called “hateful” and “discriminatory.”\\nBy nature, free people disagree with one\\nanother in an infinite number of ways. If we are to remain free, we must be\\nable to disagree without fear of punishment. Hate speech laws would quash\\ndissent in violation of liberal norms. \\nThe U.N. should take particular issue with\\nhate speech laws, given its task of supporting the liberal order. Hate speech laws\\nempower governments to censor their citizens when they express their values and\\nbeliefs, including religious beliefs. The U.N. ought to openly reject hate\\nspeech laws.\\nIn the realm of religion, the stakes are especially high. Abrahamic religions and other faiths offer truth-seekers different and mutually exclusive belief systems regarding the meaning of life, the existence of God, and the nature of good and evil. \\nFreedom allows the seeker to compare these\\nclaims, choose among them, and then order his or her life around them. And such\\nbeliefs are found everywhere, in every culture. Protecting their freedom to\\nchoose and practice a religion is central to their flourishing.\\xa0 \\nUnfortunately, the concept of hate speech is all too often wielded to silence comparisons between ideas that are essential to truth-seekers. \\nFor example, the Organization of Islamic\\nCooperation has actively advanced blasphemy laws at the U.N. under the\\nmisleading moniker “defamation of religions.” In Pakistan, the government has\\nused blasphemy laws to punish the weak, religious minorities, and women. \\nOne Catholic mother of five, Asia Bibi, spent years on death row simply because a co-worker with a personal grievance accused her of insulting the prophet Muhammed. Her acquittal sparked nationwide rioting. \\nRather than pacifying the hostility,\\nblasphemy laws fomented social intolerance and violence by legitimizing the\\nidea that offensive words cause injury and should be punished—the same notion\\nthat defines hate speech.\\nAlthough the specifics of the U.N. secretary\\ngeneral’s plan have yet to be fully articulated, the U.N.’s own track record presents\\na cause for concern. \\nOne impetus for the campaign is the rise of anti-Semitism—a valid concern on its face. Yet resolutions at the U.N. routinely delegitimize, demonize, and apply double standards to the Jewish state of Israel. Political leaders—including some in the U.S.—have recently unleashed old anti-Semitic tropes. \\nCombating anti-Semitism does not require giving\\npolitical leaders the power to shut down speech. Government leaders should\\naddress the anti-Semitism within their own ranks, and the United Nations should\\ntake a hard look at its own anti-Semitic resolutions.\\nIn another disturbing trend at the U.N., a\\ndesignated official called the independent expert on protection against\\nviolence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity\\ncalled for religious and political leaders to be held accountable for speech\\nthat the U.N. deems “homophobic or transphobic.” \\nEuropean governments have already punished\\npastors and imams for stating that marriage is between a man and a woman. The U.N.\\nshould not exacerbate this illiberal trend by treating reasonable disagreements\\nabout sexuality and marriage as discrimination. \\nIn 1992, the U.S. Senate ratified the\\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, a U.N. treaty that binds\\nsignatory nations to protect a list of political rights. When ratifying it, the\\nSenate made a reservation to Article 20, which prohibits advocacy of “national,\\nracial, or religious hatred.” \\nThe senators who made that reservation\\ncertainly did not condone hatred. But they were discerning. They saw that such\\na rule could be misused and wielded to restrict freedom. After all, as a nation\\nfounded by religious dissenters, Americans know how easily terms like hate can\\nbe used by the powerful to limit the speech of the powerless. \\nAs the U.N. meets again, the U.S. should lead the world on a\\ndifferent path. Instead of promoting the misguided idea of hate speech,\\ncountries should focus on empowering the oppressed by protecting religious\\nliberty and free speech for all, and by calling upon politicians and U.N.\\nbureaucrats to examine their own biases.\\nA plaque at the Statue of Liberty is inscribed: “Liberty is the air America breathes…” \\nLiberty is essential for people around the world to seek knowledge about the truth, and to speak up against those who oppress them based on their beliefs. \\nEven the most well-intended plans to combat anti-religious attacks through restrictions on speech will be counterproductive. Extinguishing liberty won’t simply suppress vile ideas—it will also snuff out those who speak from their conscience.',\n",

But as our culture has become more and more sexualized, children\\nhave become the casualties of adult exploitation. \\nThe New York Times just\\nreported that more than 45 million online photos and videos of children being\\nsexually abused were reported by tech companies, more than double what they\\nfound the previous year. \\nIn culture, education, and\\nhealth care, American children also are increasingly targeted for sexual\\nmessages, images, and themes at younger ages. Sometimes, this is even supported\\nby taxpayer money through government-led initiatives.\\nOur culture is saturated with\\nsexual content that was once considered too risqué for children, and social\\nmedia has accelerated the spread of pornography to young viewers.\\xa0\\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics reports that in the United\\nStates, 42% of children between 10 and 17 have viewed pornography online. \\nSocial media also has become prime hunting ground for sex traffickers.\\xa0In March 2019, Instagram was reportedly the leading social media platform for child grooming by sexual predators.\\nA recent poll of 2,000 teens\\nfound that nearly 75% had received pornographic direct messages from strangers,\\neven if they had a private account. And 55% of victims of sex trafficking in 2015 met their abuser through a\\nwebsite, app, or text. \\nThe sexualization of children\\nis occurring in brick-and-mortar spaces too as “drag queen story hours,” in\\nwhich cross-dressing adult entertainers interact with children in\\ntaxpayer-funded local libraries, have appeared across the country. \\nIn education, the United\\nNations promotes Comprehensive Sexual Education around the world. In America,\\ngroups such as Planned Parenthood, Human Rights Campaign, and the Gay, Lesbian,\\nand Straight Education Network promote “comprehensive”\\nsexual education, which includes instruction about homosexual practices, transgender\\ntheory, and abortion.\\nColorado mandates such\\ncurriculum for students in elementary school and recently considered stripping\\naway parental opt-out provisions. \\nSexual orientation and gender\\nidentity curriculum is not limited to sex education. California, New Jersey,\\nand Illinois passed laws\\nrequiring schools to teach about the “political, social, and economic\\ncontributions of … lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people,” which\\nfrequently include dubious assertions about the sexual orientation or gender\\nidentity of historical figures that are irrelevant to their achievements. \\nThe House of Representatives\\nrecently passed the Equality Act, which would amend Title IV of the Civil\\nRights Act to include sexual orientation and gender identity as protected\\ncharacteristics. This curriculum could be required if the Equality Act were to\\nbecome law. \\nThe Department of Education\\nunder the Obama administration pressured schools to implement transgender\\npolicies that pose risks to children’s privacy and safety. In Georgia, Pascha Thomas’\\n5-year-old daughter was sexually assaulted in a restroom at an elementary\\nschool that adopted a gender identity-based access policy without notifying\\nparents. \\nEfforts to expose children to\\nage-inappropriate content and make parental notification and opt-out difficult\\nor impossible undermine parents’ constitutional right to control their\\nchildren’s education on sensitive topics such as human sexuality. Public\\nschools should not become a place where children are exposed to radical sexual\\nideology.\\nFinally, the increased\\nprevalence of transgender ideology in culture and education has narrowed the\\ntreatment options for children with gender dysphoria. \\nTransgender activists pressure both doctors and parents to consent to “gender-affirming medical treatment” for children who otherwise likely would grow to accept their bodies. Such treatment typically starts with puberty blockers at age 8, cross-sex hormones at 14, and genital surgery for boys as young as 17. In one case, a 13-year-old girl was given a double mastectomy.\\nThe detrimental side effects of hormones, such as increased depression, loss of bone density, and sterility, are well-known.\\xa0Yet 15 states have banned counseling for gender-dysphoric children that would help them become comfortable with their biological sex.\\xa0 \\nThe Equality Act, if passed,\\nwould make medical professionals liable to lawsuits for gender identity\\ndiscrimination if they declined to do “sex reassignment” procedures on\\nchildren, regardless of conscientious objection or best medical judgment. \\nThe Trump administration\\nreversed policies under the Obama administration that created the same\\nliabilities, but parents continue to find that the medical system and the legal\\nsystem are working against them. In Ohio, a couple lost custody\\nof their daughter because they refused to allow her to take testosterone.\\nCombating the premature\\nsexualization of children by adults requires focused attention from both lawmakers\\nand courageous parents.\\xa0 \\nOn Wednesday, Oct. 9, The Heritage Foundation and Family Policy Alliance will co-host a Summit on Protecting Children from Sexualization to examine these issues in-depth.

This piece of federal legislation, being pushed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., would create a civil right for male athletes to self-identify as females at any time, without any evidence of physical changes to their bodies. \\nIt would spell “the end of women’s sports,” in the words of Duke University Law School professor Doriane Lambelet Coleman, who testified against the bill at a recent House Judiciary Committee hearing. \\nBut at that hearing, Sunu Chandy of the National Women’s Law Center trivialized these concerns. She stated, “We do not create policy about myths and stereotypes … There’s no research to support the claim that allowing trans athletes to play on teams that fit their gender identity will create a competitive imbalance.” \\nYet such evidence does exist. There is plenty of empirical\\nevidence showing that replacing “sex” with “gender identity” as a criterion for\\nentry into athletic competition would eliminate opportunities for the athletic\\nabilities of large numbers of women to be properly recognized. \\xa0\\nIn the case of Mack Beggs, a female wrestler who identifies as male, she was allowed to take testosterone. That led three of her female competitors to forfeit the competition out of fear of being injured.\\nAs Coleman testified in the hearing, “So overwhelming is the advantage of testosterone that thousands of men and boys could defeat the female Olympic gold medalists in the 400 meters.” \\nShe also wrote in The New York Times, “It doesn’t matter that there are 100 females and three males in a girls’ race if the three males win spots in the final or on the podium because they are males.”  \\n>>> Her Daughter Has to Compete Against Biological Males in Track. Now This Mom Is Speaking Out.\\nEveryone has the right to compete in sports, but creating a\\nright to compete on the basis of gender identity won’t simply add a right. It\\nwill eliminate the right of women and girls to compete against members of their\\nown sex. \\n\\xa0In 1972, Congress\\npassed Title IX of the 1972 Educational Amendments to the Civil Rights Act, which\\nordered schools to create separate athletic teams for women. Congress didn’t simply\\ntell schools to let women compete for spots on men’s teams. That would have\\nbeen self-defeating, as only a few exceptional female athletes would win spots\\ndue to men’s greater physical power, strength, and speed. \\nYet despite ample scientific evidence of males’ physical advantages over females, supporters of the Equality Act like Yale University School of Law professor Kenji Yoshino insist that “trans women have not broadly displaced or disadvantaged non-trans women or girls when allowed to compete in accordance with their gender.”\\n>>>\\nLook\\nto States for Preview of Havoc the ‘Equality Act’ Would Wreak\\nBut even without the Equality Act, women and girls are losing\\ntitles, medals, and scholarship opportunities in states where gender identity has\\nalready replaced sex. H.R. 5 would dramatically accelerate and expand these adverse impacts on females by requiring athletic programs to recognize\\ngender identity as a protected class in order to receive federal funding. \\nHere are 10 examples of male athletes identifying as women\\nin female sports. Under the Equality Act, we could only expect more of this.\\nIn the last example, 16-year-old Selina Soule described the race as “demoralizing” because, when male athletes enter women and girls races, everyone knows who will win before the race begins. Even worse, her chances of being seen by college scouts disappeared when Yearwood and Miller took top spots at the state championships. \\nSoule said she chose to speak out so that no other girl\\nathlete would face the same disappointment. Hopefully, Congress will listen to\\nvoices like hers before it’s too late. ',\n",

Soon activists called for a boycott. Then officials banned them from selling in a key market. Faced with mounting social, economic, and legal attacks on their business, the company’s leadership was faced with an impossible decision: conscience or livelihood?\\nNo, the scene was not the Georgia corporate headquarters of Chick-fil-A, America’s third-largest fast food chain. It was the home of Steve and Bridget Tennes, a Catholic family who run Country Mill Farms in Michigan.\\n>>> Watch the Tennes family’s story:\\nA Facebook discussion about their beliefs on marriage led LGBT activists to call for boycotts. The East Lansing City Council declared that their beliefs themselves constituted discrimination and banned them from selling their apples at the farmer’s market.\\nThe controversy over Chick-fil-A’s decision to end financial giving to the Salvation Army and Fellowship of Christian Athletes has spotlighted the conundrum faced by people nationwide whose values don’t line up with progressives’ new orthodoxy.\\nWe can make too little and too much out of this incident. One way to underestimate it is to think it only happens on Wall Street. It’s happening as much on Main Street, with more dire economic consequences for smaller businesses and for individuals.\\nAnother mistake would be to assume this is a one-off in a “culture war” from which businesses can simply choose to drop out. Chick-fil-A didn’t start the war over marriage, and it won’t be able to simply drop out. Instead, LGBT activists are forcing it to pick sides.\\nThe attacks on Country Mill Farms and Chick-fil-A follow a pattern. Four types of attack lead to freedom’s decline. It starts with social ostracization, then economic discrimination, then legal punishment (including criminal penalties), and often ends in violence, either by the state or the mob.\\nWe pay attention to these attacks overseas in their final stages, but often miss how gradual the decline of freedom is and fail to recognize them in our own country.\\nIn 2012, when Chick-fil-A CEO Dan Cathy said he believes what billions of Jews, Christians, and Muslims around the world believe about marriage, LGBT activists swiftly attacked in the media and launched boycotts that have become international. Officials sought to ban the restaurant from selling in airports, college campuses, and metropolitan centers.\\nWhen the Family Research Council supported Cathy’s stance on marriage, a vigilante set out to assassinate its employees simply because they disagree on marriage. A security guard foiled the plan, but not before taking a bullet himself. Chick-fil-A’s story includes all four types of attack.\\nWorldwide, the forces who seek to impose orthodoxy follow the same playbook. There is one right belief which is sacred. Everyone must conform. Dissenters must be punished.\\nAnd as Chick-fil-A is learning, there is no “enough” in the vocabulary of the high priests of progressivism. After it announced the end of its support for the Salvation Army and Fellowship of Christian Athletes, an LGBT group, GLAAD, said the company should next “unequivocally speak out against the anti-LGBTQ reputation that their brand represents.” Others said the company should “make amends for past statements and deeds” by donating to pro-LGBT groups. Reparations, anyone?\\nThe cornerstone of the LGBT movement’s legal strategy is to convince people that mere disagreement on marriage and biological sex is anti-LGBT discrimination, even though it’s no such thing. Tim Gill, the multimillionaire whom Rolling Stone calls the “megadonor behind the LGBTQ rights movement,” has bragged that these laws will be used to “punish the wicked.”\\nHere is where we could make too much out of this story. Chick-fil-A leadership’s reported decision to disavow charities that align with values that the company once espoused has demoralized many. And millions are still hoping the company will issue a clear statement of support for the deserving charities that progressives have sought to demonize.\\nBut ultimately, the future of freedom won’t only be determined in corporate boardrooms. It will be determined by whether the American people and their representatives can rightly distinguish between disagreement and discrimination.\\nFirefighters, pilots, entertainers, and tech CEOs have lost jobs, promotions, and access to markets because they refused to go along with the new orthodoxy. The Tennes family chose to fight and are four years into litigation against the city of East Lansing.\\nThe future of freedom depends on whether we can live with difference and respect the consciences of all in the marketplace. If not, we risk seeing things get even uglier.\\nOriginally distributed by Tribune Content Agency.',\n",

It could obstruct the work of service providers in these fields as it already has in the areas of homelessness and foster care. \\nMoreover, such language could drive a wedge between parents and their children. \\nDangers of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Language\\nRecent debates in the House over the Equality Act highlighted some of the perils of adding the language of gender identity and sexual orientation into federal law. \\nBecause of state laws that enshrine this language, medical providers are being sued because they do not support transgender activists’ recommended medical treatments for gender dysphoria. These include the experimental use of hormones on children as young as 8 and double mastectomies on girls as young as 13. \\nThere is vigorous debate in the medical community about the best treatments for gender dysphoria. \\nSome distinguished professionals do not think transition surgery is good medicine. Yet in 15 states, transgender activists have already succeeded in banning counseling that would allow parents and children to undergo a period of “watchful waiting” to see if children become comfortable with their bodies. This is unwise. \\nIndividuals who suffer from anorexia, bulimia, body integrity identity disorder (the desire for loss of a limb or a sense), or gender dysphoria experience deep discomfort with their bodies, which can lead to mistaken beliefs about themselves and reality. \\nBut, as Ryan T. Anderson has explained:\\nThe most helpful therapies focus not on achieving the impossible—changing bodies to conform to thoughts and feelings—but on helping people accept and even embrace the truth about their bodies and reality. A sound understanding of physical and mental health [and] medicine [aims] at restoring health, not simply satisfying the desires of patients.\\nStudies show that 80% to 95% of gender-dysphoric children eventually grow out of their dysphoria and become comfortable with their bodies after puberty if there is no hormonal or surgical intervention. \\nMoreover, those who undergo sex-reassignment surgery commit suicide at 19 times the rate of the general population, and almost double the rate of transgender-identifying adults overall. \\nThis high rate is not simply owing to a\\nfailure of society to accept transgenderism. Adults like Walt Heyer who suffered\\nfrom gender dysphoria, and now regret having pursued sex-reassignment, say counseling\\nsaved them from suicide. \\nJames Shupe, who attributes his gender dysphoria to PTSD and other traumas, said the transgender community’s medical recommendations endangered his life. \\n“It did not help me at all,” Shupe said. “It destabilized my mental health, because I was living in a false reality. I was fighting my body. I was fighting society. I perfectly understand why this kills people and why there’s such a high suicide rate. Society gets the blame. It’s not society. It’s the program itself that’s killing us.”\\nThis “program” recently led a government agency in Cincinnati to charge parents of a gender-dysphoric girl with child abuse when they expressed a preference for counseling and would not consent to testosterone treatments for their daughter. \\nAfter the agency’s charge against the parents, a state judge terminated the couple’s parental rights. \\nSimilarly, in Illinois, the state has mandated that its child welfare employees and prospective foster parents follow the recommendations of the transgender movement or else be disqualified from serving. \\nA prospective foster parent who wants to allow a gender-dysphoric child a period of “watchful waiting” will be weeded out of the prospective pool of families. \\nThis move is especially misguided at a time when there are 17,920 children on the waiting list for foster families in Illinois (and more than 437,500 children nationwide).\\nPutting Transgender Ideology Into Law\\nThe House version of the Stronger Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, or H.R. 2480, which passed in May, would expand abuse-prevention outreach requirements to include “sexual and gender minority youth.” \\nThe bill itself does not define the term, but references the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s definition of “sexual minority youth” that also includes the term “transgender.”\\xa0 \\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s use of the terminology of transgender theory adopts one side of the debate over the best medical treatments for gender dysphoria. \\nIn addition to incorporating the terminology of the transgender movement, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cites one of the most powerful transgender lobbying organizations, the National Center for Transgender Equality, as a resource. It openly promotes sex-reassignment procedures and supports litigation against those who hold a different view. \\nThe National Center for Transgender Equality website states” \\nIt is illegal discrimination for your health insurance plan to refuse to cover medically necessary transition-related care. … For example, if a plan covers breast reconstruction for cancer treatment, or hormones to treat post-menopause symptoms, it cannot exclude these procedures to treat gender dysphoria.\\nThis isn’t dangerous for the activists, but rather, for people who suffer from gender dysphoria, including youth. \\nAnd new language in the legislation requires state governors who receive federal funds for child abuse prevention to ensure the state will integrate efforts with organizations that partner with “sexual and gender minority youth.” \\nMedical associations, medical professionals, de-transitioners, biological parents, and prospective parents all stand to be harmed if federal law adopts the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention terminology and accepts the transgender community’s recommended medical treatments for gender dysphoria. \\nIf the bill passes the Senate with the same language as the\\nHouse version, the federal government’s treatment of vulnerable children and\\nyouth will be increasingly under the control of the transgender movement’s\\npolitical ideology. \\nBut, as Princeton University professor Robert P. George states, “Changing sexes is a metaphysical impossibility because it is a biological impossibility.” \\nChanges to law that require service providers to affirm sex-reassignment as the only valid treatment for gender dysphoria could ultimately reduce the pool of available providers and lead to greater harms to gender-dysphoric children and their parents. \\nResearch Being Ignored\\nTo strengthen efforts to address child abuse, lawmakers should consider the well-documented and widely-agreed upon evidence on family structure. \\nThe House version of the child abuse legislation draws on the most recent National Incidence Study of Child Abuse to make recommendations, including preference under the Adoption Opportunities program for “sexual and gender minority youth.” \\nBut the legislation does not address the population that is statistically most at risk—children in unstable families. \\nIndeed, the bill seems to ignore the study’s findings on family structure, including that children living with a single parent and their unmarried partner were sexually abused at a rate nearly 20 times higher than children living with their married biological parents. \\nWhen lawmakers create conditions for service providers to\\npartner with the government, they should rely on the highest quality and most\\nreliable research, not on controversial political ideology. \\nHopefully the Senate will give weight to the evidence that the research provides about family structure and incorporate this information into its public-private partnerships. \\nDoing so would go a long way toward empowering service providers, rather than crowding them out if they don’t assent to controversial new gender ideology.\\nLegislation Could Backfire on the Elderly\\nThe other community at risk is the elderly. \\nAs Congress considers modernizing the Older Americans Act, Sens. Michael Bennet, D-Colo.; Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska; and Bob Casey, D-Pa.; have introduced the Inclusive Aging Act. \\nThis proposal would establish an Office of Inclusivity and Sexual Health within the Administration on Aging, as well as a new grant program to be carried out under that office. \\nThe new grant program would follow the\\ntroubling trend of making transgender theory into a political litmus test that\\nexcludes some service providers, including faith-based ones, from participating\\nin government-run programs, obtaining licensing, or serving communities in need. \\nOrganizations that follow a biology-based\\ndefinition of sex rather than transgender theory may not be able to satisfy new\\nrequirements in the Older Americans Act unless they offer the full array of\\n“sexual health services,” or that they have a “formal relationship” with\\norganizations that assist LGBT individuals. \\nThe legislation would establish an Office of\\nInclusivity, and only elder care providers who can prove they embrace LGBT\\nideology will be eligible for grant money. \\nIn California and Murkowski’s home state of Alaska, both faith-based and secular women’s homeless shelters are embroiled in litigation over whether transgender theory will override the sex-segregation of private facilities such as sleeping facilities and showers. \\nSimilarly, the introduction of transgender theory into the elder care arena could complicate the work of facilities such as nursing homes that have sex-segregated private facilities.\\nLetting Faith Groups Continue to Serve\\nThese are the clear harms that could result if the government conditions efforts to care for the vulnerable on assent to controversial new political views about sexuality and sex differences. \\nMany in this nation are moved to care for the least among us because of their faith. Each year in America, an estimated 350,000 religious congregations operate schools, pregnancy resource centers, soup kitchens, drug addiction programs, homeless shelters, and adoption agencies that serve 70 million Americans. \\nThe value of their services is estimated at $44.3 billion\\xa0annually. Religious organizations account for 40% of the top 50 U.S. charities.\\nBut if these\\norganizations and others must accept beliefs about sexuality and sex\\ndifferences that are opposed to scientific and medical knowledge and to their\\nreligious beliefs, they may not be able to continue serving. And without their\\ncontributions, the federal government may not have enough resources to serve\\nthe needy. \\nLawmakers should consider these problems before politicizing the care of the elderly and children.',\n",
       " 'The Supreme Court heard oral argument Wednesday over the constitutionality of the Peace Cross, a 93-year-old memorial honoring World War I dead. (Photo: The Washington Post/Getty Images)\\n\\nElizabeth Slattery\\n/\\n@EHSlattery\\n\\nElizabeth Slattery writes about the proper role of the courts, judicial nominations, and the Constitution as a legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation. Read her research. She hosts SCOTUS101, a podcast about everything that’s happening at the Supreme Court.\\nThe Supreme Court heard oral argument Wednesday in a case\\nchallenging the constitutionality of a World War I memorial in Bladensburg,\\nMaryland. \\nIn American Legion v. American Humanist Association, the Supreme\\nCourt will weigh in on whether a state’s maintenance of a 93-year-old World War\\nI memorial that includes a 40-foot cross—known as the Peace Cross—is an\\n“establishment of religion” in violation of the First Amendment. \\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit held that the Peace Cross violates the establishment clause, concluding that the size and prominence of the cross convey government endorsement of Christianity and the state’s maintenance of the cross is an excessive entanglement with religion. One of the judges went so far as to suggest a way to “fix” the establishment clause problem would be to\\xa0cut off the arms of the cross. \\nIt was a packed house Wednesday at the Supreme Court, with three lawyers arguing on behalf of the Peace Cross’ constitutionality and a fourth arguing against. The justices came prepared with a lot of questions and at times talked over each other and the four advocates. \\n>>> Watch The Heritage Foundation’s event, “At a Crossroads: The Supreme Court’s Establishment Clause Jurisprudence”\\nNeal\\nKatyal, a former Obama administration attorney and second-in-command for then-Solicitor\\nGeneral Elena Kagan, represented the Maryland-National Capital Park and\\nPlanning Commission, the state agency charged with the memorial’s upkeep. \\nMichael\\nCarvin, an attorney with Jones Day who’s argued a number of high-profile cases,\\nrepresented the American Legion. Jeff Wall of the U.S. Solicitor General’s\\nOffice represented the federal government. Monica Miller of the American\\nHumanist Association made her Supreme Court debut arguing against the Peace\\nCross. \\nHere are six key exchanges from the oral argument. \\n1. What Message Does the Peace Cross Convey?\\nKatyal was the first up to the podium, and he got only a few sentences in before Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan jumped in, wanting to know more about the Peace Cross and its message. \\nKatyal\\nexplained that the American Legion’s symbol is featured prominently on the\\ncross and there is no other religious content in the park where it sits. It’s\\nlocated on a median within a busy traffic roundabout. This wasn’t always the\\ncase, but over the years, the roads around the Peace Cross were expanded, to\\nthe point that the state of Maryland became concerned about traffic safety and\\nacquired the site from the American Legion. \\nThe\\nAmerican Legion holds an annual event at the site on Veterans Day, and there\\nhave been no religious events held there. \\nKatyal noted that there’s a clear secular purpose for this monument, and that, indeed, one of the key initial fundraisers for the privately-funded cross was Jewish. He explained that there is a long tradition of using the cross to memorialize the soldiers who died in World War I. It was “the dominant image of the time, everything from [the field of Flanders] poem to art, to the war bond advertisements … to the 1924 congressional resolution.” \\n>>>\\xa0Listen to “SCOTUS 101,” a podcast with Elizabeth Slattery and friends bringing you up to speed on what’s happening at the Supreme Court.\\n2. Kagan’s Five Crosses \\nKagan\\nsuggested that if a local government tried to put up a cross like this today,\\nit would be problematic. She posed a hypothetical with five different kinds of\\ncrosses: a World War I memorial cross erected 93 years ago, a World War I\\nmemorial cross erected today, a generic war memorial cross, a cross\\nmemorializing those who died in some other kind of tragedy, and a cross that\\nwas unrelated to any war or tragedy and didn’t memorialize anyone. She wanted\\nto know which of these crosses are permissible under the First Amendment’s establishment\\nclause, and why.\\xa0 \\nWall explained that the first four examples would most certainly be constitutional, and the fifth would depend on the purpose because context matters. He pointed to the Supreme Court’s 2014 ruling in Town of Greece v. Galloway, saying traditions that could be traced back to the founding era or those that posed no greater danger than what the Founders were concerned about should withstand constitutional scrutiny. \\nWall pointed out that our nation has a long tradition of accommodating religious symbols, including crosses. Kagan retorted that the cross is the “pre-eminent symbol of Christianity,” but Wall noted that it has “a unique history to World War I” in memorializing those who died in service to our country. \\nLater in the argument, Miller was asked which crosses on public land should be allowed to stand. Justice Samuel Alito mentioned the Irish Brigade monument in Gettysburg. Miller answered: Only those in settings where the cross is akin to an artifact in a museum and the government acts “like a curator.”\\n3. ‘Is It Too Loud?’ \\nAlito\\nasked Miller what kind of monument a town could put up to memorialize those who\\ndied in a shooting at a synagogue. She responded that an obelisk with a Star of\\nDavid would be permissible, but a 40-foot Star of David would be problematic. \\nShe continued, “Is it too loud?” or does “the commemorative purpose predominate?” \\n>>>\\nRelated: Why\\nthe Peace Cross Case Represents the Best of America\\nJustice\\nNeil Gorsuch then jumped at the opportunity to bring up standing to bring a\\nlawsuit in the first place. He said, “We have to tolerate one another” in this\\ncountry, but this is the “only area [of the law where] we allow people to sue\\nover offense” alone. “Why shouldn’t we apply normal standing rules that require\\nmore than offense?” Gorsuch asked. \\nMiller answered that the Peace Cross and other similar monuments send the message that “non-Christians are inferior” and “lesser citizen[s].” She continued, noting that the Peace Cross’ reference to valor, endurance, courage, and devotion “translates to Christian valor, Christian courage,” and so on. \\nChief Justice John Roberts asked if one complaint from one person should be enough to bring a lawsuit. Miller replied, “No … it would have to be that you are a member of the community” and you are “personally affected by the message.” \\n4. How Should the Supreme Court Determine What an ‘Establishment’ of Religion Is? \\nTime and\\nagain, the conversation came back to which test the Supreme Court should use to\\nevaluate monuments like the Peace Cross for an establishment clause violation. \\nThe\\nConstitution commands that “Congress shall make no law respecting an\\nestablishment of religion,” and this extends to the states through the 14th\\nAmendment. \\nTo\\ndetermine whether a government action runs afoul of this prohibition, the\\nSupreme Court has developed a number of tests that look for “excessive\\nentanglement” of government with religion, an endorsement or disparagement of a\\nparticular faith tradition, or government coercion, while also weighing the\\nhistory and context of the challenged religious practice or display. \\nThe\\nSupreme Court has applied these tests inconsistently, however, giving the lower\\ncourts little guidance about how and when to apply them. Last year, Justice Clarence\\nThomas wrote that the Supreme Court’s “establishment clause jurisprudence is\\nin disarray.” \\nWhen the\\njustices agreed to hear the Peace Cross case, many scholars hoped the Supreme\\nCourt would provide some clarity. But after 70 minutes of oral argument, a clear\\nanswer did not emerge. \\nCarvin,\\nrepresenting the American Legion, argued that the Supreme Court should adopt a\\ntest looking for coercion or proselytization. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg asked\\nhow that would be different from the protection offered by the free exercise clause.\\nCarvin responded that being forced “to pay three pence to a minister wouldn’t\\nviolate free exercise … but it would violate the establishment clause.” \\nKagan and\\nGorsuch both wanted to know what proselytizing is, and how it’s different from\\nthe current endorsement test. Carvin explained that proselytizing is the\\ngovernment preaching and trying to convert citizens, such as by conditioning\\naccess to government services on religious beliefs. Under this theory, a symbol\\nlike the Peace Cross would be “presumptively constitutional” unless the\\ngovernment was seeking to convert citizens to a particular religion. \\nKatyal argued\\nthat the Peace Cross is constitutional under any of the existing tests, and he\\npointed to its longevity (it stood for 86 years without any question of its\\nconstitutionality) and secular purpose as reasons the Supreme Court should\\nuphold it. \\nWall pointed to the particular significance of the cross in memorializing those who died in World War I. He maintained that the Supreme Court should consider the historical understanding of the establishment clause: to prohibit government coercion of religious belief or practice. The Founders did not seek to prohibit acknowledgement or accommodation of religion in the public sphere, so the justices should ask whether a monument like the Peace Cross poses the type of dangers the Founders were concerned about.\\nMiller maintained that the establishment clause “prohibits the government from preferring one religion over another,” and said there are roughly 20 different factors for the Supreme Court to consider. Roberts balked at that, saying, “There must be something more concise.” \\n5. Should the Supreme Court Overrule the Lemon Test? \\nGorsuch brought up the unworkable multi-factor Lemon test (named for the Supreme Court’s decision in Lemon v. Kurtzman) that Justice Antonin Scalia once compared to a “ghoul in a late-night horror movie that repeatedly sits up in its grave and shuffles abroad after being repeatedly killed and buried.” \\nGorsuch\\npointed out that the Supreme Court hasn’t used this test in years, although the\\nlower courts continue to use it and sorely need guidance on this point. He\\nasked Miller if the justices should officially retire this “dog’s breakfast” of\\na test. In response, she urged the Supreme Court not to overturn Lemon, arguing\\nthat it can be very useful. \\nJustice\\nBrett Kavanaugh retorted, “How can it be useful when we haven’t used it in the\\nmost important cases that are on point here? … The lower courts need some clarity.”\\n\\nWhen Katyal returned to the podium for his rebuttal, Kavanaugh posed the same question. Katyal replied that the Peace Cross is constitutional under any of the tests previously employed by the Supreme Court and that it’s “unnecessary to overrule Lemon” in this case. Instead, the justices should “wait for a case where Lemon” is relevant.\\n6. What’s the Real-World Impact of This Case?\\nIf the\\nSupreme Court rules that the Peace Cross is unconstitutional, it will put at\\nrisk dozens of other monuments throughout the country. \\nAlito\\nasked Miller, “What message does it send knocking down crosses across the\\ncountry?” She refused to answer, saying the Peace Cross could be moved to\\nprivate land. \\nSotomayor noted\\nthat the Peace Cross is “falling apart and has to be fixed,” so why not move it\\nand then fix it up? Miller seemed unconcerned by the potential for damage to\\nthe cross, saying that entire historic homes have been successfully moved. \\nShe also\\nargued that the other parties grossly exaggerated the number of other crosses\\nthat could be affected by this case. \\nAlito\\nrejoined, “Would you like us to write that … no other cross has to be torn down\\n… in the opinion?” Miller replied that the case was “ill-suited for sweeping\\nannouncements.” \\nThe American Legion\\xa0put the issue in\\nperspective in its brief to the Supreme Court: \\nIf a century-old war memorial that is only in government hands because of traffic safety considerations arising 40 years after it was built is unconstitutional, it is difficult to conceive of any cross-shaped monument that will survive.\\nWhat to Expect\\nBased on\\nhow the oral argument went, it’s clear that a number of the justices are\\nconcerned about the broader impact a decision in this case could have. It could\\ntake months for them to sort through those questions, determine which test to\\nuse, and come to a consensus. But it seems likely that a majority of the\\njustices will vote to uphold the Peace Cross. \\nThe\\nSupreme Court will likely issue its opinion by the end of June, when the\\ncurrent term ends. \\nIt’s\\nimportant to keep in mind that the Constitution does not mandate a “wall\\nof separation between church and state,” as Thomas Jefferson once wrote in a\\nprivate letter. Using the symbol of the cross to honor those who gave their\\nlives defending our nation and our freedom is consistent with the Constitution,\\nand the Supreme Court should uphold this longstanding tradition. \\xa0',\n",
       " 'Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts arrives Thursday in the Senate chamber for impeachment trial proceedings at the U.S. Capitol. (Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\\nThe House of Representatives has chosen members to\\nparticipate in the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, and they\\nhave presented the articles of impeachment to the Senate. \\nThis is only the third impeachment trial of a president\\nin our nation’s history, with the others occurring in 1868 for Andrew Johnson\\nand 1999 for Bill Clinton.\\nHere are eight things you need to know as the Senate prepares to begin Trump’s impeachment trial. \\nSenate President Pro Tempore Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, administered the oath Thursday to Chief Justice John Roberts, who will preside over the trial.\\nRoberts, in turn, administered the oath to all senators. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., announced that the trial itself will begin at 1 p.m. Tuesday. \\nThe Clinton impeachment took five weeks, and Johnson’s lasted 11 weeks. The Senate’s impeachment trial rules, adopted in 1986, mandate that the trial should begin at noon and last until the Senate decides to adjourn, Monday through Saturday, “until final judgment shall be rendered.” \\nAn\\nimpeachment trial is not like a run-of-the-mill trial, but it does have some\\nsimilarities. House managers will act as the prosecution, presenting the case\\nfor impeachment to the senators, whose role is a combination of judge and jury.\\n\\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announced the seven members of the House who will serve as the managers, including Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y.\\nA team of lawyers will put on the president’s defense, including White House counsel Pat Cipollone; Trump’s personal attorney, Jay Sekulow; and former independent counsel Ken Starr, whose investigation into the Whitewater controversy led to Clinton’s impeachment. \\nRoberts will preside over the trial, consistent with Article 3, Section 6 of the Constitution, although it is mostly a ceremonial role. \\nAfter presiding over Clinton’s impeachment trial, then-Chief Justice William Rehnquist said, “I took a leaf out of [Gilbert and Sullivan’s comic opera] ‘Iolanthe’ … ‘I did nothing in particular, and did it very well.’”\\nWhen the trial begins, the Senate will adopt a resolution establishing the specific timetable, including the time allotted for each side to present its case, senators to ask questions, and the Senate to consider motions. \\nAt that\\npoint, if the Senate follows the general pattern of the Clinton trial, the\\nSenate will vote on a motion to dismiss the impeachment and, if that motion\\nfails, on whether additional witnesses or evidence should be considered. \\nDuring\\nJohnson’s impeachment trial, the prosecution and defense called a total of 41\\nwitnesses. During the Clinton trial, three witnesses provided videotaped testimony.\\n\\nMcConnell and several other Senate Republicans have indicated they think the Senate should rely on transcripts of the testimony of witnesses who appeared before the House, while Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and several other Democrats have demanded that witnesses be called to testify.  \\nNo. While\\nthe Senate does issue a summons to the individual being tried, its impeachment\\ntrial rules allow for an appearance by the defendant or by his attorney. \\nThe\\nSenate tried, unsuccessfully, to force Johnson to appear for his impeachment\\ntrial. The New York Times published\\nan account of how Chief Justice Salmon Chase asked the Senate sergeant-at-arms\\nto summon the president. \\n“In a\\nloud voice, and amid the stillness of the whole chamber, he called three times,\\n‘Andrew Johnson, Andrew Johnson, Andrew Johnson!’” but instead the president’s\\nlegal team, including Attorney General Henry Stanbery (who\\nresigned the day before) and former Supreme Court Justice Benjamin Curtis,\\narrived. \\nClinton likewise did not appear before the Senate during his trial. \\nTrump previously indicated he would “strongly consider” testifying or providing a written statement to the House during its impeachment inquiry, but that didn’t happen. Odds are, Trump won’t be present at the Senate trial. \\nSenators are not required to employ a specific standard of proof. During the 1986 impeachment trial of U.S. District Judge Harry E. Claiborne, he made a motion to designate “beyond a reasonable doubt”—the standard in criminal trials—as the standard for his trial. \\nAfter\\nthe presiding officer ruled that “the question of standard of evidence is for\\neach senator to decide individually,” the Senate voted 75 to 17 against\\nestablishing a mandatory standard.\\nSimilarly, the rules of evidence used in criminal trials do not apply in an impeachment trial. The Senate’s impeachment trial rules state that the Senate’s presiding officer has the authority to rule on questions of evidence. \\nAny senator, however, may ask that the full Senate vote on such matters. That reflects the Constitution’s assignment to the Senate of “the sole Power to try all Impeachments.” \\nSenators\\nhave taken an oath to “do impartial justice, according to the Constitution and\\nlaws” in all things pertaining to the impeachment trial. \\nSen.\\nDick Durbin, D-Ill., the minority whip, argued\\nthat some senators have already failed to meet the “independent and dignified”\\nstandard the Constitution envisioned. \\nThere\\nhave already\\nbeen calls for the House managers to move to disqualify senators whose\\nimpartiality is in question. There is no basis in the Constitution, Senate\\nrules, or history for such an attempt. \\nThe only qualification for participating in a Senate impeachment trial is to be a senator. \\nWhile\\nthe trial itself will be open to the public, the Senate’s deliberations after\\nits conclusion will not be.\\nThe Senate will then come back into public session to vote on each article of impeachment. Senate impeachment trial rules say that the Senate must vote on each article in its entirety, and the Constitution requires the vote of “two-thirds of the [senators] present” for conviction.  \\nRemoval\\nfrom office is automatic upon conviction, and the Senate may vote separately\\nwhether to disqualify the defendant from serving in any other federal office.\\nThe Constitution explicitly provides, however, that these consequences by the Senate do not, if the defendant’s conduct is also criminal, prevent “Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.”  \\nIn theory, he likely could be retried in the future.\\xa0Although neither the Constitution nor Senate rules address this issue, and no precedent exists for it, a few legal scholars, such as former Obama administration official Neal Katyal, have pointed out that the Fifth Amendment Double Jeopardy Clause does not apply to impeachment proceedings.\\xa0 \\nA retrial on the same charges, however, would seem highly unlikely, and such a retrial would certainly run counter to the general principle of double jeopardy that someone cannot be tried twice for the same offense.\\xa0 \\nWhat is more plausible and likely is that the House would introduce new articles of impeachment, which it could do.  \\nSenate committees may hold hearings in the morning of\\neach trial day, but doing any business such as sending bills, nominations, or\\nother matters to the full Senate would require the consent of all senators. \\nThe Senate impeachment rules provide that the chamber\\nmust suspend its legislative and executive business while the trial is under\\nway. \\nThe trial should not affect the Supreme Court’s oral argument schedule. The court has arguments scheduled Tuesday and Wednesday, but those will conclude by 11 a.m. \\nThe\\ncourt won’t meet again for arguments until Feb. 24. Aside from taking up some\\nof Roberts’ time in the afternoon, the trial is unlikely to otherwise affect the\\ncourt. ',\n",
       " 'New York City’s regulations banned residents from taking their lawfully owned and registered handguns anywhere outside their homes except to one of seven gun ranges within city limits. (Photo: Stock/Getty Images)\\n\\nElizabeth Slattery\\n/\\n@EHSlattery\\n\\nElizabeth Slattery writes about the proper role of the courts, judicial nominations, and the Constitution as a legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation. Read her research. She hosts SCOTUS101, a podcast about everything that’s happening at the Supreme Court.\\nThe Supreme Court\\nheard oral argument\\xa0Monday in the first major case involving gun rights in\\nnearly a decade. A local shooting club is challenging New York City’s handgun\\nregulations, perhaps the most restrictive and draconian in the nation.\\nNew York’s\\nregulations banned residents from taking their lawfully owned and registered\\nhandguns anywhere outside their homes except to one of seven gun ranges within\\ncity limits. The city prohibited residents from transporting their handguns to\\nranges outside the city or to any other location, including a resident’s second\\nhome. \\nThe Supreme Court\\nagreed to hear this case in January and added it to the 2019-2020 calendar that\\nbegan in October. In the intervening months, the city revised its regulations,\\nallowing gun owners to transport their handguns to ranges outside the city as\\nwell as to second homes.\\nThis course change\\ncame after six years in which the city defended its prior regime as\\nconstitutional. The city then suggested the justices dismiss the case as\\n“moot,” but the Supreme Court proceeded with oral argument. \\nIt was a packed house\\xa0as gun control advocates protested on the plaza outside the court. Inside, former U.S. Solicitor General Paul Clement argued on behalf of the shooting club and shared time with Jeffrey Wall, the second-highest lawyer in the Solicitor General’s Office. Richard Dearing, a lawyer with New York City’s legal department, defended the regulations. \\nAlthough some justices\\npeppered the three lawyers with questions, Justices Clarence Thomas and Brett\\nKavanaugh remained silent. Chief Justice John Roberts asked New York’s lawyer questions\\nonly about the issue of mootness. \\nHere are four key exchanges from the argument in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. City of New York: \\n1. Is This a Live Case or Controversy? \\nThe Constitution\\nlimits judicial review to live “cases” or “controversies,” which means judges\\nmay not issue “advisory opinions” on hypothetical matters. In order for a case\\nor controversy to be “live,” a court must be able to grant some relief to the\\ncomplaining party.\\nJustices Ruth\\nBader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor seized on this immediately. New York argues\\nthat it has given the shooting club members everything they want, leading\\nGinsburg to ask: “What’s left of this case?”\\nSotomayor\\nasserted, “You are asking us to take a case where the other side has thrown in\\nthe towel.” \\nBut as Roberts wrote in a 2007 opinion, under the doctrine of voluntary cessation a defendant does not “moot” a case by willingly stopping the action that gave rise to litigation unless it is “absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.”\\nOtherwise, the\\ngovernment could change its laws or regulations at the 11th hour and prevent\\nthe Supreme Court from ruling. Justice Neil Gorsuch called the city to task,\\nsaying it took “herculean, late-breaking efforts to moot” the case. \\nOn behalf of the\\nshooting club members, Clement explained that they seek a declaration that the\\ntransportation ban is and was unconstitutional, to prevent the city from\\nreversing course in the future. \\nClement pointed out that the new regulations (which require “continuous and uninterrupted transport”) also pose issues—would members violate the new regulations if they stopped at a coffee shop or rest stop on the way to a shooting range outside the city? For this reason, he argued, the case is not moot. \\n2. What Happens If the Case Is Moot?\\nIf a majority of justices\\nis persuaded that the case is moot, several other Second Amendment cases are waiting\\nin the wings. The justices could agree to take up another case and hear oral\\nargument in the spring. \\nA quick search of\\nthe Supreme Court’s docket, for example, turned up Worman v. Healey, challenging\\nMassachusetts’ ban on firearms and magazines that are commonly used in more\\nthan 40 states; Mance v. Barr, challenging the federal law criminalizing\\ninterstate handgun sales; and Rogers v. Grewal and Gould v. Morgan, challenging\\nMassachusetts’ and New Jersey’s requirements that concealed-carry permit\\napplicants show a “good reason” or “justifiable need” (aside from self-defense)\\nfor carrying a handgun outside the home. \\nUndoubtedly, scores of other cases are winding through the district and appeals courts across the country.  \\n3. Does NYC’s Law Advance Public Safety?\\nGinsburg balked at\\nthe city’s suggestion that under the prior regulations, residents with a second\\nhome should simply buy a second gun and leave it unattended. \\n“What public\\nsafety or any other reasonable end is served by [having one gun] in a place\\nthat is often unoccupied and … more vulnerable to theft?” she asked. \\nOn behalf of the\\ncity, Dearing struggled to find an answer, noting that historically there have\\nbeen “incidental burdens” similar to this. \\nJustice Stephen\\nBreyer asked whether the change in regulation had affected public safety (the\\ncity’s rationale for its original regime). Dearing answered that the police\\ncommissioner determined that the ban on transporting handguns “could be\\nrepealed without a negative impact on public safety.”\\nJustice Samuel\\nAlito followed up: “So you think the Second Amendment permits the imposition of\\na restriction that has no public safety benefit?” \\nDearing again\\nappealed to history, saying that the focus should be on “how the restriction\\naccords with history under the Second Amendment.” \\nThis led to a discussion of the heart of the case—whether the Second Amendment protects a right that extends beyond the home.  \\n4. How Far Does the Second Amendment Extend?\\nWhen it decided\\nlandmark Second Amendment cases in 2008 and 2010, the Supreme Court left for\\nanother day the issue of whether the right extends beyond the home. \\nAlito asked\\nDearing, the city’s lawyer, whether he concedes that the Constitution protects\\n“possession of a firearm outside the home under at least some circumstances.” \\nDearing replied:\\n“The Second Amendment has something to say about what effective possession in\\nthe home means. And sometimes that may mean that you need to be able to …\\nundertake certain activities outside the home.” \\nThat basically\\ngives the case away, if the justices reach the merits. \\nBut after an hour\\nof argument, it’s unclear whether a majority of the justices thinks the case is\\nmoot. Based on their questions (which do not always reflect how a justice ultimately\\nwill vote), Gorsuch and Alito think the court should reach the merits, while\\nGinsburg, Sotomayor, and Breyer think the case is moot. \\nPreferring to play\\nit close to the vest, Roberts asked only a few questions. \\nWhether or not the justices end up ruling on the merits, it likely is only a matter of time before the Supreme Court takes up another gun rights case. \\nThe lower courts could use guidance from the Supreme Court about the scope of the Second Amendment—including what standard of review courts should use to judge restrictions on gun rights; what types of firearms, ammunition, and magazines states may prohibit; and whether states may require concealed-carry permit applicants to show a “good cause” before obtaining a permit. \\xa0\\nIn any event, this Supreme Court term is not short on blockbusters. Other cases involve abortion, the Trump administration’s attempt to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, and whether federal law prohibiting sex discrimination covers claims of discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.\\nLike those cases, the\\nSupreme Court’s ruling in the New York handgun case likely will come by the end\\nof June. \\n>>>\\xa0Listen to “SCOTUS 101,” a podcast with Elizabeth\\nSlattery and friends bringing you up to speed on what’s happening at the\\nSupreme Court.',\n",

City of New York, its first major case\\ninvolving the Second Amendment in nearly a decade. \\nIn District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) and McDonald v. City of Chicago (2010), the court ruled that the Second Amendment is not a collective right enjoyed only by state militias, but an individual right that applies to both the federal government and the states. \\nUp until now, the court has turned down many\\nopportunities to hear cases raising related issues, such as what standard of\\nreview courts should use to judge restrictions on gun rights; what types of firearms, ammunition, and magazines states may prohibit;\\nand whether states may require applicants for a concealed carry permit to show\\na “good cause” or “justifiable need” before obtaining a permit. \\xa0\\n>>>\\xa0Read more about cases the Supreme Court will hear in\\n2020.\\nThe case to be argued Monday involves New York\\nCity’s ban on the transportation of licensed\\nhandguns anywhere within city limits except to gun ranges. The city required residents\\nto obtain a “premises license” in order to possess a handgun in their home or\\ntransport it to one of seven gun ranges. \\nUnder these regulations, residents were not permitted\\nto transport a licensed handgun outside the city. \\nNot surprisingly, members of a local\\nshooting club challenged these restrictions. They argued that the restrictions\\nfail any level of scrutiny under the Constitution, burden the fundamental right\\nto travel, and violate the Constitution’s commerce clause by controlling\\neconomic activity beyond the city’s borders. \\nDistrict and appellate courts both ruled\\nin favor of the city. Once the Supreme Court granted review of the case, however,\\nNew York City amended the regulations to allow residents with a premises\\nlicense to transport their handguns to another residence within or outside the\\ncity and to gun ranges outside the city. \\nNow the city argues that the case is moot\\nbecause the changes gave members of the shooting club everything they sought in\\nthe lawsuit. The members disagree, maintaining that the case is not moot\\nbecause the Supreme Court still could rule that the original transport ban was\\nunconstitutional. \\nSuch a ruling would prevent the city from\\nchanging course in the future. \\nThe New York case does not present the justices with the opportunity to rule on broader issues that have percolated in the lower courts since the Heller and McDonald decisions. Nevertheless, the fact that the justices will hear the case is a step in the right direction, hopefully providing lower courts guidance they sorely need. \\n$12\\nBillion Obamacare Bait and Switch\\nOn Dec. 10, the justices will hear three consolidated cases stemming from\\nthe Patient Protection and Affordable Care\\nAct, popularly known as Obamacare. \\nThe cases challenge the federal government’s\\nfailure to reimburse health insurance providers for losses they incurred by offering\\ninsurance coverage, consistent with the Affordable Care Act, to those who previously\\nwere uninsured or had preexisting conditions. \\nThe consolidated cases are Maine Community Health Options v. United\\nStates; Moda Health Plan, Inc. v. United States; and Land of Lincoln Mutual\\nHealth v. United States.\\nIn passing the Affordable Care Act\\nin 2010, Congress set up a program to incentivize insurers to offer coverage to\\npeople considered “risky” from an insurance perspective. The program required insurers\\nto pay a portion of any savings into it if their costs were lower than\\nexpected, and the government would reimburse insurers for a portion of their\\nlosses for three years if costs were higher than expected. \\nAfter insurers began offering insurance\\nplans on the new health insurance exchanges under Obamacare, Congress used\\nappropriations riders to effectively defund the program for fiscal years 2015,\\n2016, and 2017. \\nInsurers paid roughly $482 million into\\nthe program from 2014 to 2016. Following the formula Congress came up with, the\\ngovernment owed insurers nearly $12 billion.\\nAs a result of the dramatically higher\\ncosts, 18 of 24 insurers went out of business and several others stopped offering\\ncoverage through the insurance exchanges. This led to skyrocketing costs, less\\ncompetition, and fewer coverage options. \\nSeveral insurers sued the government for\\ndamages, arguing that it had breached an implied contract and violated the\\nstatute. The lower court ruled that through the appropriations riders, Congress\\nhad impliedly repealed the Obamacare provision setting up the program and that\\nthe statute lacked the language necessary to bind the government in a contract.\\nAt the Supreme Court, the insurers argue\\nthat the government’s roughly $12 billion bait and switch will endanger\\npublic-private partnerships in the future if the government can induce massive\\nreliance by private parties and then fail to hold up its end of the bargain. \\nThey also point out that Congress did not\\nrepeal the Obamacare provision setting up the program; instead, it limited the\\nsource of funding, which did not eliminate the government’s financial\\nobligation. \\nThe government maintains that Congress did not create an entitlement that insurers are owed, but simply set up a program that would be “budget neutral”—entirely funded by insurers’ payments. The government also contends that a strong presumption exists against treating statutes like contracts, since statutes are inherently subject to change. \\nThis is the fifth case stemming from the Affordable\\nCare Act to reach the Supreme Court, and a sixth one may be on its way soon. \\nThe handgun and Obamacare cases are two\\nof the significant cases the Supreme Court will hear in December. The justices likely\\nwill issue decisions in all of this term’s cases by the end of June.\\n>>>\\xa0Listen to “SCOTUS 101,” a podcast with Elizabeth Slattery\\nand friends bringing you up to speed on what’s happening at the Supreme Court.',\n",
       " 'The day that racial\\npreferences are finally expunged from university admissions, hiring practices, and\\ncontracting, we should all pause and quietly remember U.S. District Court Judge\\nAllison D. Burroughs. \\nBy deciding that\\nHarvard’s race-conscious admissions policies were not just constitutional, but\\nalso a necessary evil on the road to colorblind nirvana, she rendered useful\\nservice. \\nWittingly or not,\\nthe judge has kicked the matter closer to the Supreme Court, where this heinous\\npractice will eventually be ended.\\nBurroughs based her decision on the tired and self-contradictory argument that all we need to do to fight discrimination is put up with more and more years of state-sanctioned discrimination until we get to the point when we don’t need it anymore. \\nHow long will Supreme Court justices hear this as the years go by until they realize that it would never end? \\nBurroughs reached that conclusion Oct. 1 in a U.S. district court in Boston. Harvard’s “holistic” admissions policy, she ruled, does not violate the Constitution by giving blacks and Hispanics what the university terms a “plus factor” advantage denied to Asian Americans and whites.\\nA group of Asian American students, Students for Fair Admissions, had argued that the subjective personal criteria Harvard applies in its “holistic” admissions process unfairly penalized Asian Americans. \\nFor example, the university regularly rates Asian American applicants lower on criteria such as “leadership qualities” and “sense of humor.” In the objective academic measurements of grade point average and SAT scores, Asian American applicants surpassed members of all other racial and ethnic groups.\\nBut Harvard does not “intentionally discriminate,” wrote the judge. Nor does it engage in impermissible racial balancing, she concluded, despite the fact that the admissions rate for Asian American applicants has stagnated at around 20% for many years. \\nThe university,\\nshe wrote, is just pursuing a compelling interest in diversity, and “some\\nracial categorizations are necessary to serve that interest … .”\\n“A race-conscious admissions program allows Harvard to achieve a level of robust diversity that would not otherwise be possible, at least at this time,” Burroughs wrote.\\nIt was here that\\nthe judge began to wax poetic—literally, at one point quoting Toni Morrison. But\\nher decision contained some lyricism of her own, rhapsodizing that, “at least\\nfor now, ensuring diversity at Harvard relies, in part, on race-conscious\\nadmissions. … The students who are admitted to Harvard … will have the\\nopportunity to know and understand one another beyond race, as whole\\nindividuals with unique histories and experiences.”\\xa0 \\nShe added: “It is\\nthis, at Harvard and elsewhere, that will move us, one day, to the point where\\nwe see that race is a fact, but not the defining fact and not the fact that\\ntells us what is important, but we are not there yet.”\\nThis “temporary\\nsolution,” however, has a long—albeit dubious—pedigree. In the 2003 Grutter v.\\nBollinger decision that reaffirmed racial preferences, Justice Sandra Day\\nO’Connor suggested an expiration date: “It has been 25 years since Justice [Lewis]\\nPowell first approved the use of race to further an interest in student-body\\ndiversity in the context of public higher education … . We expect that 25 years\\nfrom now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further\\nthe interest approved today.”\\nInterestingly,\\nBurroughs sought to kick the can down the road even further by writing this\\nweek, “As time marches on and the effects of entrenched racism and unequal\\nopportunity remain obvious, this goal might be optimistic and may need to\\nchange.”\\nO’Connor was referring\\nto Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, a fractured 1978 decision,\\nin which Powell wrote the controlling opinion. That decision gave colleges the\\ngreen light to implement race-conscious admissions programs. \\nIn a concurrence\\nthat provided a fifth vote, Justice Harry Blackmun wrote, “In order to get\\nbeyond racism, we must first take account of race. There is no other way. And\\nin order to treat some persons equally, we must treat them differently. We\\ncannot—we dare not—let the Equal Protection Clause perpetuate racial\\nsupremacy.”\\nDecades later, in\\na 2007 ruling, Chief Justice John Roberts advised instead that the way “to stop\\ndiscrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of\\nrace.” \\nHarvard’s discriminatory program—which is hardly an outlier among Ivy League institutions—appears to be heading to the Supreme Court. Perhaps when it reaches the justices, they will see the harm caused by decades of government-sanctioned discrimination and decide it is long overdue to bring an end to this odious practice. ',\n",
       " 'The Supreme Court justices are faced with deciding whether it’s reasonable for the president to abandon an arguably unlawful program put in place by a predecessor. (Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\\nThe Supreme Court heard oral argument Tuesday in three cases challenging the Trump administration’s attempt to roll back the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.\\nPresident Barack Obama had previously explained that\\nsuch a program was beyond the scope of the executive branch’s authority, saying\\nin an interview, “I’m not the emperor … My job is to\\nexecute laws that are passed. And Congress right now has not changed what I\\nconsider to be a broken immigration system.”\\nNevertheless, the Obama administration went on to create\\nthe Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals \\xa0program in 2012, allowing about 700,000\\nillegal aliens who came to the United States as children to apply for work\\nauthorization and deferred deportation. \\nFast-forward to 2017, the Trump-led Department of Homeland Security announced it would roll back the program that likely violated the constitutional separation of powers as well as federal immigration laws. \\nAs justification, it pointed to court rulings invalidating a related program for illegal alien parents of U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents.\\nThe rollback decision drew immediate legal challenges\\nacross the country, and three district courts ruled against the administration.\\n\\nIn the course of the litigation, then-Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen issued a memorandum more fully explaining the administration’s reasons for rolling back DACA, including that it is likely unlawful and also runs counter to the agency’s law enforcement priorities. \\nNow at the Supreme Court, the justices are faced with\\ndeciding whether it’s reasonable for the president to abandon an arguably unlawful\\nprogram put in place by a predecessor. \\nThe Trump administration argues that federal law bars\\nreview of agency enforcement decisions, such as the DACA rollback, that are\\n“committed to agency discretion by law.” But if the decision is reviewable, the\\nadministration maintains that it was rational to abandon an unlawful program. \\nThe following are a few key exchanges from the oral\\nargument: \\nJustice Elena Kagan asked why the underlying DACA policy would be reviewable by courts, but the rescission of that policy would not be. “Are you suggesting that there’s an asymmetry in what’s reviewable?” she asked U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco. \\nHe replied that neither “side is arguing that the\\n[Immigration and Nationality Act] somehow restricts our ability to enforce the\\nlaw. And it would be quite surprising if Congress were to pass a law that says\\nsomething is illegal and then tries to somehow restrict the government’s\\nability from enforcing the laws that it passes.” \\nIn essence, the administration argued that DACA deviated from federal immigration laws and that its rollback would bring the government back into compliance with the law. \\n2. How Strong Are DACA’s Reliance Interests?\\nJustice Samuel Alito asked about whether this action would\\n“remove certain benefits,” and Francisco explained that benefits expire “on\\ntheir own terms” because DACA did not actually confer any benefits.\\nJustice Neil Gorsuch wanted to know about how much DACA recipients relied on the program continuing—had the administration “adequately considered” these reliance interests?\\nFrancisco asserted that “to the extent there are any reliance interests, they’re extremely limited.” The DACA program “was always meant to be a temporary stopgap measure that could be rescinded at any time, which is why it was only granted in two-year increments,” he explained. “So, I don’t think anybody could have reasonably assumed that DACA was going to remain in effect in perpetuity.” \\nJustice Stephen Breyer asked about the reliance\\ninterests of businesses employing DACA recipients. Francisco said Nielsen’s\\nmemo “explicitly considered the[se] reliance interests” when making the\\ndetermination to roll back DACA. \\nFurther, Francisco pointed out that the other side “has\\nagreed that we could rescind DACA at any time if, at least in their view, we\\ndid provide a little bit more detailed of an explanation. So, I think that is\\nfoursquare against the notion that there are some significant reliance interest,\\nbecause all that they seem to be saying is, we have to write a few more words.”\\nGorsuch asked Ted Olson, the lawyer representing DACA\\nrecipients, about reliance interests and why the government’s rationale for\\nrolling back DACA was supposedly insufficient: “What good would another five\\nyears of litigation over the adequacy of that explanation serve? … What more\\nwould you have the government say about [the] reliance interests?” \\nOlson responded that there wasn’t an administrative\\nrecord supporting the government’s determination.\\xa0 \\n3. A Matter of Enforcement Priorities?\\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg brought up the claim that DACA was simply prioritizing how to handle the estimated 11 million illegal aliens present in the country. \\n“Don’t you have to set up some kind of categories?” she\\nasked, since the government “[doesn’t] have the resources, so you have to\\nprioritize. Everybody agrees you have to prioritize.” \\nFrancisco countered that DACA “goes far beyond simply\\ndiverting resources to higher-priority targets,” and “it actively facilitates\\nviolations of the law.”\\nKagan said the Obama administration based its decision to implement DACA on the Immigration and Nationality Act’s “grant of broad discretion over national immigration enforcement policy.” \\nFrancisco replied that “the most that does is, it gives you the authority to set policies and priorities,” and that “there’s a big leap between that and saying that you can affirmatively facilitate violations of the [law] by hundreds of thousands of individuals to whom Congress has repeatedly declined a pathway to lawful status.”\\nOlson said the Obama administration’s decision was “responsive\\nto explicit congressional direction to … establish enforcement priorities.” He\\nadded, “That’s what DACA was all about. It said it did not establish any status;\\nit did not provide any benefits. It articulated an enforcement priority.” \\n4. What’s the Limiting Principle?\\nGorsuch wanted to know what limiting principle the\\nchallengers believe the court should adopt on whether to review this kind of agency\\nenforcement decision.\\nOlson suggested “it’s a composite of principles,” including “a categorical determination involving a substantial number of people.” \\nBut Gorsuch jumped in. “Let me just stop you there,\\nthough, because, if it’s categorical, and a large number of people, I can think\\nof a lot of prosecutorial decisions involving drug cases, the treatment of\\nmarijuana in … our society today under federal law… [that] affects lots of\\npeople on a categorical basis every day,” he said. \\nOlson explained that the government’s decision not to prosecute certain drug cases is “completely different,” because people who have set up businesses\\xa0and relied on the government’s statements about not prosecuting marijuana cases “are not invited to participate in a program … to come forward” the way DACA recipients were. \\n5. Does the Administration Believe DACA Is Illegal? And Does It Matter?\\nOne of the points that the justices returned to\\nthroughout the argument was the claim that the Department of Homeland Security felt\\ncompelled to roll back DACA because it was illegal. \\nThe challengers maintain that this isn’t a sufficient\\nreason. \\nChief Justice John Roberts asked Michael Mongan, the solicitor general of California arguing on behalf of several states seeking to uphold DACA, “Is it enough … to say, look, ‘I’ve got a decision from the [lower court] that tells me [the other deferred deportation program] is illegal. It’s been affirmed by the Supreme Court by an equally divided vote. That’s enough for me to say we’re not going to [continue DACA]’?” \\nMongan replied, “It’s not enough … given the nature of\\nthis program and the interests at stake, we don’t think that any genuine\\nstatement of legal doubt or litigation risk would be adequate.” \\nKagan wanted to know what an adequate explanation would\\nlook like. “What do you think they would have to do to be in the clear on\\nthis?” she asked. Mongan asserted that the government should “at least have to\\nidentify the particular grounds that they’re relying on” and take “ownership of\\na discretionary choice to end this policy.” \\xa0\\nFrancisco rebutted that claim, saying, “We own this. We both own the policy rationale set forth in Secretary Nielsen’s memorandum. Also, because we think this is not subject to judicial review at all, we own the legal judgment set forth in Secretary Nielsen’s memoranda … .”\\n“We do think that DACA is illegal and was justifiably … rescinded\\non that basis,” he said.\\nAfter 80 minutes of oral argument, several of the\\njustices seemed concerned that there wasn’t much more the Trump administration\\ncould offer to support the DACA rollback decision. \\nA ruling for the challengers that simply required the\\nDepartment of Homeland Security to bulk up its legal and policy rationales for\\nrolling back DACA would likely lead to more years of litigation, as Gorsuch\\npointed out. \\nDACA was supposed to be a temporary fix to allow\\nCongress more time to consider the hotly debated issue of how to handle the\\npresence of illegal aliens in our country. But instead, Congress has not come\\nup with a solution. \\nThe Supreme Court should allow the Trump administration to roll back DACA and to set its own immigration enforcement priorities. Then, the ball will be back in Congress’ court. ',\n",

Glover. \\nThe issue is\\nwhether it’s reasonable for a police officer to assume that the person driving\\na car is the registered owner and, when that person has a suspended license, make\\na traffic stop based on that assumption. \\nDouglas County,\\nKansas, Sheriff’s Deputy Mark Mehrer ran the license plate of a pickup truck\\nand found that the registered owner, Charles Glover Jr., had his license revoked.\\n\\nWe don’t know why\\nMehrer decided to check this plate in the first place. (Perhaps he was having a\\nslow day.) He then proceeded to conduct a traffic stop, which resulted in\\nGlover being charged with driving as a habitual violator. \\nGlover filed a\\nmotion to suppress the evidence obtained during the traffic stop, arguing that the\\nofficer lacked reasonable suspicion to conduct the traffic stop. \\nThe state district court ruled in favor of Glover. The case eventually reached the Kansas Supreme Court, which held that the officer’s assumption alone did not establish reasonable suspicion of criminal activity in order to conduct a stop consistent with the Fourth Amendment. \\nNow at the U.S.\\nSupreme Court, Kansas argues that the state court’s standard requires more than\\nreasonable suspicion, and in any event, brief investigative stops impose a\\n“minimal intrusion” on people. \\nAn officer can determine quickly upon pulling a vehicle over whether the driver is the registered owner. Glover maintains that increases in technology, such as license plate readers that can scan hundreds of license plates on the road in minutes, could lead to subjecting more and more law-abiding drivers to the stigmatizing experience of being pulled over. \\n>>>\\xa0Listen to “SCOTUS 101,” a podcast with Elizabeth Slattery and friends bringing you up to speed on what’s happening at the Supreme Court.\\nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program\\nThe Supreme Court will hear arguments in three consolidated cases (Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of the University of California, Trump v. NAACP, and McAleenan v. Vidal) related to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program on Nov. 12. \\nThe DACA program was created during the Obama administration by the Department of Homeland Security, allowing illegal aliens who were 30 years old or younger and came to the United States as children to apply for work authorization and deferral of deportation. \\nThen the Obama administration expanded the program by removing the age limit and created a related program, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans, for the parents of U.S. citizens who came to the country illegally. \\nTwenty-six\\nstates challenged DAPA and the DACA expansion, arguing that the programs\\nviolated the Administrative Procedure Act’s requirement that substantive agency\\nrules go through public notice and comment. \\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit sided with the states. The case reached the Supreme Court in 2016, but Justice Antonin Scalia died while the case was pending. The eight-member court deadlocked, leaving the lower court ruling in place.\\nFast-forward\\nto the Trump administration, and the Department of Homeland Security concluded\\nthat DACA itself was unlawful and decided to roll back the program, while continuing\\nto process renewals for current DACA recipients for six more months. \\nNot\\nsurprisingly, that decision drew several legal challenges. District courts in\\nNew York; Washington, D.C.; and California ordered the Trump administration to\\nstop implementing its rollback of the DACA program. \\nNow\\nat the Supreme Court, the Trump administration argues that its decision to\\nreverse a program that it considers unlawful is rational, and that, in any\\nevent, since the Administrative Procedure Act prohibits judicial review of\\nagency enforcement decisions, courts may not review its decision. \\nDACA\\nrecipients and several states that challenged the action contend that it’s not the\\ntype of enforcement decision contemplated by the Administrative Procedure Act’s\\nbar on reviewability. They also maintain that the decision was based upon\\nracial animus and deprived recipients of due process.\\xa0 \\nThese\\nare just two of the important cases the Supreme Court will hear in November.

Read her research. She hosts SCOTUS101, a podcast about everything that’s happening at the Supreme Court.\\nIt’s not often that the Supreme Court agrees to hear a Second Amendment case. It’s been nearly 10 years since the last one, despite numerous petitions asking the justices to review state and local government attempts to regulate away the right to keep and bear arms.\\nLast January, however, the justices agreed to review New York City’s draconian and restrictive regulations prohibiting residents from transporting licensed, locked, and unloaded handguns anywhere but one of seven gun ranges within city limits.\\nIf you were fortunate enough to have a second home upstate, too bad. If you preferred a gun range across the bridge in New Jersey, tough luck.\\nMembers of a local shooting club who challenged the regulations agreed to a lengthy briefing schedule after the Supreme Court granted review. This moved the case to the 2019-2020 term, giving the city time to revise its regulations in an effort to prevent the Supreme Court from ruling on its previous regime. \\nThe city reasoned that it gave the shooting club members everything they wanted so the case is now “moot.”\\nThe Constitution bars courts from issuing “advisory opinions” on hypothetical cases. One of the things that moves a case from the hypothetical realm to the real world is a court’s ability to grant some relief to the complaining party. \\nIn New York’s view, the Supreme Court can’t grant any relief here, but the shooting club members disagree. They want a declaration that the old transportation ban is and was unconstitutional in order to prevent the city from reversing course in the future.\\nAnd under the Supreme Court’s doctrine of voluntary cessation, as Chief Justice John Roberts explained in a 2007 ruling, a defendant does not “moot” a case by willingly stopping the action that gave rise to the lawsuit unless it is “absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.”\\nShooting club members also object to the revised regulations, which now allow residents to transport licensed, locked, and unloaded handguns to gun ranges outside the city or second homes, but stipulate that any trip must be “continuous and uninterrupted.”\\nAt the oral argument Dec. 2, the justices probed New York’s lawyer about this point. They wanted to know if stopping for coffee would violate the regulations. How about a short detour to a relative’s house? The city’s pinkie-swear promise that it wouldn’t go after those types of offenders wasn’t satisfying.\\nIt takes a long time for most cases to work their way from initial filing up to the Supreme Court, and the justices take roughly 70 cases out of 7,000 petitions filed annually. This case took six years to reach the high court. \\nAfter six years of insisting that its regulations were both constitutional and necessary for public safety, it’s pretty clear what motivated the city’s 11th-hour change. Concerned about how the newly constituted Supreme Court might rule, the city chose to abandon its law in an effort to stop the justices from ruling on whether the Second Amendment protects a right that extends beyond the home.\\nThe Supreme Court should not reward such skulduggery. To do so would send the message to localities, states, and even the federal government that they can thwart judicial review and avoid accountability under the Constitution. \\nLet’s hope the justices see through this ploy and keep this case in its sights.\\n(c) 2019 Tribune Content Agency, LLC.',\n",

She hosts SCOTUS101, a podcast about everything that’s happening at the Supreme Court.\\nThe Supreme Court heard oral argument Wednesday in an important\\ncase involving a Montana tax credit scholarship program\\xa0that\\nprovided scholarships for underprivileged kids to use at private schools. \\nInitially, families could use scholarship funds at qualified religious schools, but the Montana Department of Revenue later implemented an administrative rule excluding religious schools, citing a\\xa0provision\\xa0in the state Constitution that bars state funds from aiding religious organizations.\\nParents who relied\\non the scholarship funds to send their kids to religious schools challenged the\\nadministrative rule for violating the religion clauses of the U.S. Constitution\\nas well as the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause. \\nThe state’s highest court struck down the program in its entirety for violating the “no aid” provision in the state Constitution. Almost 40 states have similar provisions (sometimes called Blaine Amendments) that prohibit money from supporting “sectarian” schools. \\nAs Justice Clarence\\nThomas explained in Mitchell\\nv. Helms (2000), “[I]t was an open secret that ‘sectarian’\\nwas code for ‘Catholic.’” \\nNow, the Supreme\\nCourt has heard oral arguments in Espinoza\\nv. Montana Department of Revenue.\\nDick Komer of the\\nInstitute for Justice argued on behalf of the parents, and Jeffrey Wall of the Solicitor\\nGeneral’s Office represented the United States, which shared argument time with\\nthe parents. Adam Unikowsky, an experienced Supreme Court litigator, argued on behalf\\nof Montana. \\nHere are five key exchanges from the argument. \\n1. Do the parents have standing to bring this challenge?\\nJustice Ruth Bader\\nGinsburg asked the first question, and she wanted to know why the parents have\\nstanding to bring this lawsuit in the first place. \\nIn order to bring a\\nlawsuit, the complaining party must have an actual injury, and Ginsburg asked\\nif the case should have been brought by the religious schools or taxpayers who\\ndonate to the scholarship program and then receive a modest tax credit, instead\\nof the parents. \\nKomer explained that\\nthe parents were the beneficiaries of the scholarship program. \\nThen, Justice Elena\\nKagan jumped in, asking, “[W]here is the harm in this case at this point?” She\\npointed out that no one will be allowed to use the scholarship funds (whether at\\nsecular or religious private schools), so where is the discrimination? \\nKomer replied that the discrimination occurred when the Montana Supreme Court invalidated the program in its entirety. He said, “[Y]ou can’t let the remedy shield the discriminatory judgment,” which was “mistakenly believing that this Blaine Amendment and the application of it did not violate the federal Constitution.” \\n>>>\\xa0Listen to “SCOTUS 101,” a podcast with Elizabeth Slattery and friends bringing you up to speed on what’s happening at the Supreme Court.\\nChief Justice John Roberts—back at the court after presiding over President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial until the early hours of the morning—returned to the issue when Wall stepped up to the lectern. \\nWall explained that taking away the scholarship funds is a clear injury, and the parents have been penalized for their free exercise rights—not the schools’ right. \\nWall said, “Everybody concedes that if all the parents in this program had wanted to choose secular schools, there’d be no basis for the state court’s ruling. The scholarship program would still exist.” \\n2. Are states required to give money to religious schools?\\nJustice Sonia\\nSotomayor asked if the parents believe the Constitution requires states to give\\nmoney to secular and religious private schools. \\nKomer explained that\\nstates can choose whether or not they want to set up voucher programs, tax\\ncredit scholarships, or other school choice initiatives, but once they do, they\\ncan’t discriminate between parents who want to use those funds at secular and\\nreligious private schools. \\nHe noted that states are not required to create these types of initiatives in the first place, but “if they give to one, they must give to the other.” \\n3. Will the court strike down all Blaine Amendments?\\nSotomayor asked Wall\\nif all state Blaine Amendments are unconstitutional. She went on for some time\\nabout “the long history of people [going back to the founding] who for\\nnon-discriminatory reasons … have taken the position that the state should not\\ngive money to religious institutions.” \\nRoberts politely\\ninterjected, “Perhaps you could comment, counsel?” \\nWall replied that what the founding era evidence actually shows is that forced support of churches was prohibited, and that’s different from denying a “generally available benefit … to an institution [or individual] based on its religious character.” \\n4. Does eliminating the program eliminate the constitutional violation?\\nJustice Brett\\nKavanaugh asked Unikowsky if it would be constitutional to allow scholarship\\nfunds to be used at secular and Protestant schools but not Jewish, Catholic, or\\nany other religious schools. \\nUnikowsky said the\\n“right lens to look at … is the establishment clause, which prohibits the state\\n… from distinguishing between one religion versus a different religion.” \\nKavanaugh followed up, asking why giving scholarships to use at secular schools but not at religious schools is not discrimination. Unikowsky said there’s a “principled objection to funding of religious institutions,” but also that “coercing people [to use funds at secular schools] is a penalty on religion” and to balance the interests, the Montana court “simply level[ed] down” and eliminated the scholarship program.  \\nHe reiterated that the Montana Blaine Amendment is not based on “religious bigotry,” but Kavanaugh replied that these amendments were “certainly rooted in grotesque religious bigotry against Catholics. … That was the clear motivation for [Montana’s amendment.]”\\n5. How does this compare to other types of discrimination?\\nJustice Samuel Alito posed a hypothetical about a\\nscholarship program where most of the recipients ended up being black. Would it\\nbe discrimination to strike the whole program down for that reason? \\nUnikowsky agreed that would be discrimination, but responded\\nthat race and religion are not “identical for all constitutional reasons.” \\nAlito pointedly remarked, “Basically what you’re saying is, the difference between this and race\\nis, it’s permissible to discriminate on the basis of religion. It’s not\\npermissible, ever, to discriminate on the basis of race.”\\nWall addressed this issue in his opening, saying, “If the Montana Supreme Court had invalidated this program because it included historically African American schools or all-girls schools, that would be a straightforward equal protection violation. Nothing about it would be cured by the fact that other parents had been denied funding as well.”\\nAfter\\nan hour of argument, several justices, including Kavanaugh, Alito, and Roberts,\\nappeared to be troubled by Montana’s arguments while Sotomayor, Ginsburg, and\\nKagan seemed unsure about whether the parents had standing to bring the lawsuit\\nin the first place. \\nThe\\njustices should issue their ruling in this case by the end of June when the\\n2019-2020 term wraps up. \\nLooking Ahead\\nThis\\nterm is shaping up to be a significant one, and the court has already heard cases\\ninvolving the Second Amendment, Obamacare, and whether federal law covers\\nclaims of discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation. \\nLater in the spring, the justices will take up cases looking at the president’s ability to fire the head of an “independent” agency, regulation of abortion providers, a dispute over a subpoena for Trump’s financial records, and the Little Sisters of the Poor, who are still seeking relief from the Obama-era contraceptive mandate.',\n",

Read her research. She hosts SCOTUS101, a podcast about everything that’s happening at the Supreme Court.\\nThe Supreme Court, returning this week\\nfor the beginning of its 2019-2020 term, heard oral argument Tuesday in three cases\\nasking it to decide whether the definition of sex in U.S. law includes sexual\\norientation and gender identity. \\nAt issue is the meaning of the word “sex”\\nin Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the primary federal law prohibiting\\ndiscrimination in employment.\\nThe cases were brought by a gay child welfare services coordinator and a gay skydiving instructor in the first argument, and, in the second argument, a male funeral home director who was fired after announcing he was transitioning to become a woman.\\nA packed house was promised outside the Supreme Court building, where people began lining up Friday for public seating. And inside the courtroom was just as busy, with five lawyers appearing before the justices. \\nPamela Karlan, a professor at Stanford Law School, argued on behalf of the gay employees in Bostock v. Clayton County and Altitude Express v. Zarda. Jeffrey Harris, a lawyer with the firm Consovoy McCarthy, made his Supreme Court debut representing the employers in Bostock and Zarda. \\nDavid Cole of the American Civil Liberties Union represented the transgender employee, while John Bursch of Alliance Defending Freedom argued for the person’s employer in Harris Funeral Homes v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco shared time with the employers in both arguments.\\nFollowing a new rule announced last week by the high court, the\\njustices allowed each advocate to make a two-minute presentation before jumping\\nin with questions. \\nSome common themes from the justices’ questions were what\\n“sex” meant in 1964, whether the court should act when Congress could amend the\\nlaw, and what this could mean for single-sex bathrooms, sports, and more. \\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was the first to fire off a\\nquestion. She brought up the fact that when Congress passed Title VII as part\\nof the Civil Rights Act in 1964, it couldn’t have been in Congress’ mind that\\ndiscrimination “because of sex” meant discrimination based on sexual\\norientation. \\nGinsburg underscored this point by noting that homosexuality\\nwas at that time classified as a mental disorder, and many states criminalized\\nsodomy. \\nKarlan admitted that is true—calling it the “days of ‘Mad Men,’” in a reference to the hit TV series—but said the court has interpreted Title VII to cover other things that weren’t within Congress’ mind, such as sexual harassment and sex stereotyping. \\nWhen Harris took the lectern, he explained that sex and\\nsexual orientation are “independent and distinct characteristics,” and that Title\\nVII requires courts to compare similarly situated people for differential\\ntreatment.\\nFrancisco echoed this, saying that sex means “whether you’re male or female, not whether you’re gay or straight.” He argued that any doubt regarding the meaning of sex in Title VII “is removed by the history … and related statutes since.” \\nJustice Samuel Alito noted that Congress has considered various proposals to amend Title VII and, in fact, the House of Representatives passed the Equality Act\\xa0last spring. He asked whether the courts should leave this policy issue to the legislative branch. \\nKarlan countered that a ruling that sex\\ndiscrimination includes sexual orientation would be no different from the\\ncourt’s earlier rulings finding male-on-male sexual harassment and sex\\nstereotyping were forms of sex discrimination. \\nChief Justice John Roberts pointed out that roughly two dozen states have passed laws prohibiting employment discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, and many have at the same time provided robust protections for religious liberty. \\nHarris picked up on this point, noting\\nthat Wisconsin was hailed as a civil rights pioneer when it passed a law\\nbanning sexual orientation discrimination in employment in 1982. Such laws\\nwould not have been necessary, he said, if Title VII’s ban on sex\\ndiscrimination already included sexual orientation and gender identity. \\nFrancisco also addressed this point,\\nsaying that Congress is better suited to weigh the competing interests at stake\\nand address the need for religious or other exemptions. He suggested the Supreme\\nCourt should not short-circuit the democratic process and instead allow\\nCongress to work out what changes, if any, the American people want to see in\\nTitle VII.\\xa0 \\nThe justices spent a lot of time talking\\nabout whether employees’ interpretation of Title VII would spell doom for\\nsingle-sex bathrooms, sex-specific dress codes, single-sex college sports teams,\\nand shelters for battered women. \\nTitle VII, after all, is a statute\\npromoting women’s equality, Bursch pointed out, and it allows employers to\\nacknowledge that there are differences between men and women. \\nBut the ACLU’s Cole tried to avoid answering these questions, eventually responding that one has to consider “not just whether [a single-sex or sex-specific policy] differentiates, but whether it differentiates in a way that injures,” and whether a reasonable person would experience “a significant or trivial harm.” \\n\\xa0“Most instances, that’s not going to be a\\nsignificant harm,” Cole said, but when, for example, “you ask a transgender\\nperson to dress in a way that is contrary to their sense of gender identity,\\nyou have imposed a significant harm.” \\nKarlan put it slightly differently,\\nexplaining that you first look for people being treated differently based on\\ntheir sex, and then you ask if a reasonable person would be injured by that\\ndifferential treatment. \\nJustice Neil Gorsuch wanted to know how one\\ndecides what is “reasonable.” Karlan replied that an “idiosyncratic preference”\\nwouldn’t void a dress code or bathroom policy. \\nAnyone hoping for clarity after the day’s argument was left wanting. After two hours of oral argument and dozens of questions, there was not much agreement among the justices. \\nJustices Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan, and Sonia Sotomayor suggested several times that they think the text clearly favors the employees’ view. Alito and Roberts mentioned concerns about the court’s overstepping its boundaries.\\n\\xa0Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the high court’s newest justice, barely spoke at all. The justices will take the next several months to wrestle with the questions in these cases and likely issue rulings by the end of June. \\n>>> Listen to “SCOTUS 101,” a podcast with Elizabeth Slattery and friends bringing you up to speed on what’s happening at the Supreme Court.',\n",
       " 'Leading up to President Bill Clinton’s impeachment trial, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, pictured with Sen. Debbie Stabenow, repeatedly said that the Senate is “not like a jury box.” (Photo: Alex Wong/Getty Images)\\n\\nThomas Jipping\\n/\\n@TomJipping\\n\\nThomas Jipping is deputy director of the Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies and senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation.\\nIn a\\xa0column\\xa0published at Law.com in December, one commentator argued that senators who refuse to be impartial should be disqualified from participating in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump. \\nA few days ago, an ethics lawyer from the George W. Bush administration\\xa0called\\xa0Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., a “perjurer” for taking the oath to “do impartial justice” in the trial after saying he would not be an “impartial juror.” They might want to reconsider their position.\\nIf these people really mean what they say, of course, any senator who has taken a position on the president’s guilt would have to bow out. \\nIn that case, say goodbye to Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif.  On Monday, Jan. 13, she\\xa0spoke\\xa0on the Senate floor and stated, as a fact, that Trump “pressured a foreign nation to interfere in our elections.” That’s an almost word-for-word recitation of the first impeachment article, which states that Trump “solicited the interference of a foreign government … in the 2020 United States presidential election.”\\nHarris went on to say that “it is unacceptable for a president to shake down a vulnerable foreign nation for personal or political benefit.” This too echoes the first impeachment article, which claims that Trump used the power of his office “to obtain an improper personal political benefit.”\\nIf publicly accusing a defendant of the specific offense for which he has been impeached, in virtually identical language as that impeachment, is not refusing to be impartial, what is? Harris, however, is far from alone.\\nSen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, who had rejected the presumption of innocence during the confirmation process for Justice Brett Kavanaugh, has\\xa0said\\xa0she would vote to convict unless Trump could actually exonerate himself. \\nSen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., says that the impeachment articles are supported by “a wealth of undisputed facts.” And Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., was even more direct, saying that the “case is clear: President Trump tried to trade away our national security for a personal political favor.” \\nAs if reading directly from the same talking points, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y.,  says that “President Trump put our national security at risk in order to obtain political favors.” And Sen. Christopher Murphy, D-Conn., insists that “the bottom line is this: President Trump abused his authority by using taxpayer-funded aid to pressure a foreign government to help him win reelection in 2020.”\\nSenate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., has similarly attacked McConnell, accusing him of refusing to be impartial. Yet, as CNN has\\xa0reported, leading up to President Bill Clinton’s impeachment trial, Schumer repeatedly said that the Senate is “not like a jury box.” Indeed, when running for the Senate in 1998, he asked people to vote for him precisely because he would be a vote to acquit Clinton.\\nImpartiality, anyone?\\nHouse Democrats rigged the rules to guarantee a pre-determined impeachment result. Now Senate Democrats are trying to rig the jury pool by trying to exclude senators not likely to convict. We all know how this is going to end. Try the impeachment and let’s move on. \\nOriginally published by National Review',\n",
       " 'To make the charge stick, the impeachment inquiry must produce actual evidence for President Donald Trump’s specific, nefarious, impeachable intent to make Ukraine interfere in the 2020 presidential election. So far at least, it has failed to do so. Pictured: Trump speaks at the Israeli American Council National Summit Dec. 7, 2019, in Hollywood, Florida.  (Photo: Noam Galai/WireImage/Getty Images)\\n\\nThomas Jipping\\n/\\n@TomJipping\\n\\nThomas Jipping is deputy director of the Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies and senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation.\\nThe Democrats’ case for impeaching President\\xa0Donald Trump\\xa0boils down to this: the accusation that he solicited, demanded, perhaps even coerced a foreign government to help him get reelected. Such behavior, they contend, constitutes an impeachable offense.\\nThe most important task for the Senate when it conducts a trial on that article of impeachment is to determine whether that is, in fact, what Trump\\xa0did.\\nThis is not America’s first impeachment. In the past, however, the facts were clear; the challenge was deciding whether the individual’s actions fell within the Constitution’s category of “treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.” This time, before even reaching that issue, the question is what Trump\\xa0actually did.\\nThere seems to be agreement about this much: Trump\\xa0briefly put aid to\\xa0Ukraine, as well as a White House meeting with its new president, on hold.\\nIn a July 25 phone conversation with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Trump\\xa0urged the Ukrainian president to conduct two investigations. One focused on “this whole situation with\\xa0Ukraine,” referring to accusations that\\xa0Ukraine\\xa0tried to influence the 2016 president election. He also spoke about whether former Vice President Joseph R. Biden “stopped the prosecution” of a company on whose board sat son Hunter Biden.\\nA month and a half later, the administration released the aid, even though\\xa0Ukraine\\xa0undertook neither of the investigations requested.\\nNothing in that account, as far as it goes, amounts to an impeachable offense. The piece that makes or breaks the impeachment is the piece about which there is no evidence.\\nDemocrats’ and their liberal allies have told us repeatedly just what that piece is. The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence report, for example, claims that Trump\\xa0“solicited the interference of a foreign government,\\xa0Ukraine, to benefit his reelection.”\\nAfter releasing this report, Rep. Adam B. Schiff, California Democrat and Intelligence Committee chairman, spoke of a “scheme to coerce an ally into doing the president’s political dirty work.” Trump\\xa0was guilty, he said, of using “official power to compel another country,\\xa0Ukraine, to interfere in the 2020 election.”\\nLaw professors testifying at the Dec. 4 House Judiciary Committee hearing said the same thing. Harvard professor Noah Feldman asserted that Trump\\xa0“abused his office by soliciting the president of\\xa0Ukraine\\xa0to investigate his political rivals in order to gain personal political advantage, including in the 2020 presidential election.” Stanford professor Pamela Karlan claimed Trump\\xa0“did this to strong-arm a foreign leader into smearing one of the president’s opponents in our ongoing election season.”\\nBelieving something, even fervently, does not make it true. Repeating it, even endlessly, does not make it true. To make the charge stick, the impeachment inquiry must produce actual evidence for Trump’s specific, nefarious, impeachable intent to make\\xa0Ukraine\\xa0interfere in the 2020 presidential election. So far at least, it has failed to do so.\\nIn the absence of actual evidence, Trump’s critics have presented arguments such as “I wouldn’t put it past him,” “that sounds like something\\xa0Trump\\xa0would do,” or “I just know in my gut.” Sentiments, however, are not evidence. Even theories that appear to fit the facts are not evidence.\\nThe possibility that, if\\xa0Ukraine\\xa0had conducted those investigations, Trump\\xa0could have used the results to help his reelection, is not evidence of his intent either. \\nYou might argue that it would have helped his chances. Then again, virtually everything a first-term president does could affect his reelection. If you believe that any president never chose what to do or how to do it with at least an eye (and possibly other senses as well) toward how it would affect his political standing, I have some oceanfront property in Utah to sell you.\\nHow’s this for irony? On Nov. 13, as the Intelligence Committee’s first impeachment hearing opened, Schiff interrupted the Republican counsel’s questions to warn witnesses not to answer questions that “assume facts not in evidence.” With Schiff’s blessing, the House is about to impeach Trump\\xa0by doing just that.\\nOriginally published in The Washington Times',\n",

All that’s left is for the House to appoint a few members to act as the prosecutors and, as the Senate’s trial rules put it, notify the Senate that these impeachment “managers” are “directed to carry articles of impeachment to the Senate.”\\nIf this sounds a little familiar, it’s not really different from the indictment and trial you might have watched on any episode of “Law & Order.”\\xa0House Speaker\\xa0Nancy\\xa0Pelosi\\xa0,\\xa0D-Calif.,\\xa0however, appears to be making up a process of her own. She\\xa0says she won’t appoint impeachment managers or send the articles to the Senate\\xa0until the\\xa0Senate agrees to conduct its trial the way she dictates.\\nIn other words, Pelosi is holding the impeachment for ransom, keeping\\xa0the county in impeachment limbo.\\nThe House has\\xa0impeached, but the Senate cannot conduct a trial unless it agrees to Pelosi’s demands or is able to\\xa0change its impeachment trial rules\\xa0(which requires a two-thirds vote) so it can at least start a trial on its own.\\nIn response, Harvard law professor Noah Feldman, who argued strongly for impeachment as one of\\xa0House\\xa0Democrats’ hearing witnesses,\\xa0wrote an article\\xa0objecting to Pelosi’s gambit. President Donald Trump, Feldman insists, is not actually impeached until the House sends formal notice to the\\xa0 Senate.\\nFeldman\\xa0is wrong. He claims that, in the past, “‘impeachment’ occurred—and occurs—when the articles of impeachment are presented to the Senate for trial.” But asserting this is all he does. He offers nothing to suggest that America’s Founders designed impeachment this way.\\xa0His claim actually contradicts the language of the Constitution. While the House has the “sole” power of impeachment, Feldman says that impeachment cannot occur without the Senate.\\nFeldman tries to blur the lines by saying that “impeachment is a process,” but that’s not really true either.\\xa0Just like there is a process that results in an indictment, there is a process for producing an impeachment, a process that occurs entirely within the House of Representatives.\\nBut an impeachment itself, like an indictment, is a thing. The Constitution, after all, gives the Senate the power to “try all impeachments.” The Senate’s impeachment trial rules refer to “managers of an impeachment” and their first trial responsibility as “exhibit[ing] articles of impeachment.” In other words, the articles of impeachment adopted by the House are the impeachment.\\nThe House itself agrees. Its website includes a\\xa0list\\xa0of “individuals impeached by the House of Representatives.” The first name on the list is Sen.\\xa0William Blount of Tennessee. The Senate literally refused to recognize the impeachment as valid, choosing instead to expel him. The House still says he was impeached. \\nThe list also includes U.S. District Judge Mark Delahay, who is listed as being impeached even though the House appointed no impeachment managers and the Senate conducted no trial at all.\\nFeldman’s claim is like saying that, though a grand jury has voted to indict, a criminal defendant is not really indicted until that action is presented to the trial jury.\\nTo his credit,\\xa0Feldman is correct that\\xa0an indefinite delay in appointing managers and sending notice that they are ready to participate in the impeachment trial\\xa0“would pose a serious problem.”\\xa0\\nThe House impeachment process, and the impeachment itself, were purely partisan. Now that the impeachment is finished, however, trying to manipulate how the Senate conducts its trial would only taint this\\xa0whole drama even more and further distort\\xa0the Constitution’s impeachment framework.\\nSince\\xa0Feldman\\xa0is such a strong Trump critic, he likely came up with this\\xa0novel theory\\xa0to push the process ahead toward, he hopes, Senate conviction and Trump’s removal from office. His ends, however, do not justify his means.\\nThe House has done its part by impeaching Trump. The House must appoint managers and notify the Senate not because doing so is necessary to complete the impeachment, but because it’s the House’s clear\\xa0obligation under the Constitution.\\nOriginally published by Fox News ',\n",

(Photo: Alex Wong/Getty Images)\\n\\nThomas Jipping\\n/\\n@TomJipping\\n\\nThomas Jipping is deputy director of the Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies and senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation.\\nThe Constitution’s impeachment provisions are among the few that we would rather never be used. \\nPresident Donald Trump is the 20th public official, and only the third president, to be impeached by the House of Representatives. \\nBecause the result of House impeachment, followed by conviction in a Senate trial, removes the president from office, however, it’s important to understand what conduct warrants such a significant interference in our election system.\\nWhen America’s Founders wrote the Constitution, they thought it necessary to provide for the possible removal of a president for serious misconduct, but had to find the right words to describe that misconduct. \\nWords like “maladministration” were too broad, “treason and\\nbribery” too narrow. So they borrowed a phrase from English impeachment\\npractice and came up with what the Constitution says today: “Treason, Bribery,\\nor other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.”\\nThat phrase “other high Crimes and Misdemeanors” may still be a bit hazy to our 21st-century ears. What is most obvious, however, is that Congress cannot undo the last election anytime it wants by impeaching and removing the president for anything it wants.\\nThis is a critical issue. The House has impeached Trump for what it calls “abuse of power” and “obstruction of Congress” and the Senate trial of that impeachment is now underway. \\nDid the House choose a legitimate reason to impeach the president? How should the Senate evaluate the House’s impeachment and what decision should it make? \\nOn Jan. 22, a group of 21 state attorneys general released a 14-page letter offering their analysis of these issues. They looked not only at whether the facts supported the House impeachment, but also at the theory behind the impeachment. \\nWhile the facts relate to this specific impeachment, the theory can be used in the future for other impeachments.\\nThese attorneys general conclude that the first impeachment article, alleging “abuse of power,” really boils down to the claim that Trump took otherwise legal actions for a “corrupt purpose” or with a “corrupt motive.” \\nIn other words, his interaction with the government of Ukraine was not, by itself, improper at all. What transformed his actions into an impeachable offense was the supposed purpose of coercing Ukraine to interfere in the upcoming presidential election.\\nThe attorneys general warn that impeaching a president not\\nfor objectively improper actions but for his motive behind those actions\\n“encourages impeachment whenever the president exercises his constitutional\\nauthority in a way that offends the opposing political party.”\\nThis analysis also examines the motive behind the second impeachment article, which accuses Trump of “obstruction of Congress.” Here, the attorneys general explain that the separation of government powers into three branches means that each branch will guard its own power and prerogatives against demands by the others. \\nWhen, for example, the president claims what is often called “executive privilege” to resist the demands of congressional committees, he is taking exactly the steps that America’s Founders anticipated.\\nSo when the Trump administration refused to comply with subpoenas from House committees seeking witnesses and documents, the proper course would be for the House to enforce its subpoenas in court. The House did not do so.\\n In fact, the attorneys general note, when John Bolton and Charles Kupperman asked a federal judge whether they must comply with subpoenas from the House Intelligence Committee, Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., actually withdrew the subpoenas altogether.\\nThe upshot of the second impeachment article concludes this analysis, which is that House Democrats are trying to turn the normal interaction between the legislative and executive branches into an impeachable offense. \\n“President Trump has thus been charged,” the attorneys general write, “with a ‘high crime or misdemeanor’ for doing what all presidents and top advisors routinely do—invoking executive privilege when Congress seeks to unconstitutionally interfere with the president’s high-level executive communications.”\\nThis analysis is particularly valuable because it goes beyond the narrative about Trump’s telephone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and places this impeachment effort in a broader context to assess the impact it might have far beyond the events unfolding today.\\n>>> Read the full letter:\\nState AG letter to Senate o… by Fox News on Scribd',\n",

Bush, 2009); a “universal and inalienable right”\\n(Barack Obama, 2017); and “innate to the dignity of every human person” (Donald\\nTrump, 2018).\\nAll of those lofty phrases are true, as far as they go. \\nBut what is the “religious freedom” that presidents of both\\nparties have said is so important? Some have attempted to confine religious\\nfreedom narrowly to religious “worship.” \\nIn his 2016 proclamation, for example, Obama referred to the\\n“freedom to worship as we choose.” Yet for Americans, religious freedom always has\\nbeen much broader than that. \\nFrom long before America itself was born, this liberty was\\nreferred to as the “exercise of religion.” That’s the phrase that America’s\\nfounders used in the First Amendment.\\nIn 2018, Trump framed religious freedom better by describing the “right\\nnot just to believe as [Americans] see fit, but to freely exercise their\\nreligion.” He called it the “right of the individual conscience and religious\\nexercise.”\\nIn doing so, Trump echoed Clinton, who, in 2000, correctly\\nnoted that the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom pledged that no one would\\n“suffer on account of his religious opinions or beliefs.” \\nProperly understanding religious freedom in America requires fully appreciating both of these dimensions—the importance and the definition of religious freedom. And that understanding has never been more necessary than today. \\nClashes between the constitutional right to exercise\\nreligion and civil or statutory rights, such as freedom from discrimination\\nbased on controversial new categories, are multiplying all over the country.\\nPoliticians and political interests are trying to reduce religious freedom to\\nnothing more than an ordinary value or preference and to confine it to personal\\nreligious belief or, at most, to religious worship.\\nIn other words, they want to excise religious exercise from\\nAmerican life. Some take it even further, claiming that Americans who exercise\\ntheir faith are actually a danger, a negative element that should be minimized\\nor shut down entirely.\\nIn 2018, for example, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., introduced\\nlegislation, the Do No Harm Act, to exempt large categories of laws from the nation’s\\nReligious Freedom Restoration Act.\\nThe Religious Freedom Restoration Act, signed into law in\\n1993 by Clinton, sets a tough standard for government actions, including\\nlegislation, to interfere with the exercise of religion. Sen. Chuck Schumer,\\nD-N.Y., introduced the measure, which the House passed unanimously and the\\nSenate passed 97-3. \\nBy contrast, Harris’ legislation, co-sponsored by 31 other\\nDemocrats, would exempt laws that relate directly to liberal constituencies,\\nsuch as labor unions or abortion providers. Neither Congress nor executive\\nbranch agencies would have to consider at all the impact on religious freedom\\nof laws or regulations favoring those political interests.\\nThis is a long way from the deep importance and broad definition that America’s Founders placed on religious freedom. It’s in stark contrast even to the most recent presidents’ rhetoric in their annual Religious Freedom Day proclamations. \\nAs a nation, we are at a crossroads and must decide whether\\nthis freedom is what our presidents have said it is and, if so, commit again to\\nactions behind these words.',\n",
       " 'The Religious Freedom Index got disappointing results in exploring “how Americans value religion and its role in society.” (Photo: Stock/Getty Images)\\n\\nThomas Jipping\\n/\\n@TomJipping\\n\\nThomas Jipping is deputy director of the Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies and senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation.\\nThe Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a leading nonprofit\\nlaw firm defending religious freedom, is taking an innovative approach to\\nevaluate the current state of religious freedom in America. \\nMost assessments in this area focus on government actions\\nsuch as laws, regulations, or court decisions that affect religious freedom.\\nBecket’s first-ever Religious Freedom Index instead\\nfocuses on public opinion, using a national poll to examine six dimensions of\\nreligious freedom. The results are generally positive, with a few caveats.\\nAt least formally, religious freedom in America long has\\nbeen defined broadly. The First Amendment, for example, refers to the “free exercise\\nof religion,” which obviously extends beyond speech or religious worship. In\\nfact, colonial laws protected the exercise of religion for more than a century\\nbefore the United States was born. \\nIn the mid-20th century, following World War II, the U.S.\\nwas an original supporter of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Article\\n18 of that document says that religious freedom includes both belief and\\nbehavior, in private and in public, individually and collectively.\\nBut rights, even such fundamental and comprehensive ones,\\nare more than statements or ideas. To be real, they must be experienced and\\nthat, in turn, depends a great deal on people’s understanding, perception,\\nsupport, or opposition to religious freedom. This is why, for example, the Pew\\nResearch Center’s evaluation\\nof religious freedom around the world looks at social, as well as government,\\nhostilities involving religion. \\nBecket’s Religious Freedom Index asked about the degree of\\nacceptance/support or challenge/opposition to six dimensions of religious\\nfreedom. \\nThe index, for example, asked five questions about religious pluralism, such as practicing religion in daily life without fear of discrimination or harm. Overall, it shows an average of 80% support for religious pluralism.\\nAlthough there was little difference between Democrats and\\nRepublicans regarding religious pluralism, the largest gap was about the\\nfreedom to practice one’s religious beliefs “even if they are contrary to\\naccepted majority practices.” \\nSignificantly, however, Democrats led Republicans by 10 points\\n(85% to 75%). Future indexes will show whether this continues as the category\\nof “accepted majority practices” changes over time.\\nThe Religious Freedom Index also explored “how Americans\\nvalue religion and its role in society.” The results were not as encouraging. \\n“When it comes to issues and what happens today in our country,” for example, 56% said that religion is “part of the solution” while 44% said it is “part of the problem.” The division about “people of faith” was 59% to 41%. \\nProblems, of course, need solutions. This perception by many (thankfully, not a majority) that not only religion in general, but people of faith in particular, are part of the problem may weaken support for the freedom to practice one’s religious beliefs even when those beliefs are contrary to majority practices.\\nThe index also examined the familiar area of church and\\nstate. Here, even though the U.S. Constitution explicitly prohibits any\\n“religious test for public office,” one-quarter of Americans say that candidates\\n“should be disqualified or blocked from holding public offices” based on their\\nreligious beliefs. \\nThey also say that “[s]ociety should not tolerate public officials who might allow their religious beliefs to influence their decisions.” It will surprise many that the percent of religious people who say they believe this is exactly the same as the percent of agnostics and atheists.\\nThe Religious Freedom Index is based on an online poll surveying a representative sample of 1,000 Americans age 18 and older. The margin of error was plus or minus\\xa03.1%, and Heart and Mind Strategies constructed\\xa0 the index.\\nBecket’s conclusion from this first Religious Freedom Index\\nis that “there is evidence for broad support of robust religious freedom\\nprotections, discomfort with government interfering in religious practice, and\\npositive attitudes toward a culture of accommodation of religious practice.” \\nThe caveat, however, is this: “Within each dimension the\\ncomposition of support and opposition varies depending on political parties,\\nage, ethnicity and many other factors.” \\nThis means that the consensus supporting religious freedom\\nin America might be broad, but it also may not be very deep.',\n",

They killed a motion to subpoena the so-called whistleblower, who has said through his attorney that he wants to remain anonymous.\\nHere’s why the person filing the complaint should testify:\\nImpeaching and removing a president is perhaps the most consequential thing Congress can do, short of declaring war. Impeachment and removal turns our representative democracy on its head, nullifying the last election.\\nIn the case of a first-term president, impeachment deprives the American people of the chance to pass judgment on his actions and decide if they want to reelect him.\\nImpeachment is designed to be a constitutional failsafe, a measure of last resort to save the republic from imminent harm posed by the executive.\\nPublic understanding of such a grave step and confidence in its legitimacy demand that Democrats show that the impeachment proceedings now underway are more than simply an exercise of raw partisan politics.\\nThe American people need to know as much as possible about what the president is accused of. Yet the impeachment inquiry against Trump has been marked by secret proceedings, rules favoring one party over the other, and explosive accusations by people who may not even have firsthand knowledge. These are not the marks of a legitimate process. Indeed, they actively undercut the people’s trust.\\nAs then-Sen. Joe Biden said during President Bill Clinton’s impeachment in 1998: “We in Congress had better be very careful before we upset [the people’s] decision and make darn sure … that our decision to impeach him was based on principle and not politics.”\\nBiden, who went on to become vice president and is now seeking the Democratic nomination to challenge Trump for the presidency next year, was right 21 years ago and his position is the right one today. Not surprisingly, Democrats are far more eager to impeach Republican Trump than they were to impeach Democrat Clinton.\\nAs the House moves toward what appears to be Trump’s likely impeachment (followed by his likely acquittal in a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate), Democrats will need to gather all the facts and present them openly and honestly to the American people.\\nThat means that the complainant needs to answer important questions like:\\nHow did you learn about the Trump-Zelenskyy call?\\nDid you have any firsthand information?\\nWho provided you with second-hand information?\\nWhy did you think this person or persons were trustworthy?\\nDid the accounts you heard from those sources differ from the memorandum of the call released by the president?\\nMany more questions need to be asked, of course. \\nThe complainant’s attorneys have said he is willing to answer questions in writing, but that’s not sufficient. The American people need to weigh his credibility. Pieces of paper can’t answer questions.\\nAnd there are a lot of questions. As the intelligence community Inspector General noted, the complainant had significant ties to one of the current Democratic presidential candidates.\\nAccording to some media reports, the complainant is a registered Democrat who worked for then-Vice President Biden in addition to former CIA Director John Brennan and former national security adviser Susan Rice.\\nIf any of these and other unverified reports about the so-called whistleblower are true, then there is good reason to think the complainant is more like a partisan double agent than a true whistleblower.\\nAnd especially because it appears the complainant lacked firsthand knowledge of the events he complained about, there’s the question of who did. And why did they seek him out to pass their information along?\\nMotive matters. If impeachment is to be anything other than a partisan assault on our democracy, a bipartisan consensus must agree that politics was not the animating factor behind the complaint as well as the subsequent impeachment inquiry.\\nCurrent House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., had some good advice back in 1998, when he was already serving in the House.\\n“There must never be a narrowly voted impeachment, when impeachment is supported by one of our major political parties and opposed by the other,” Nadler said 21 years ago.\\xa0 “Such an impeachment will produce divisiveness and bitterness in our politics for years to come and will call into question the very legitimacy of our political institutions.”\\nCongress should heed that old but wise and very relevant advice of Joe Biden and Jerrold Nadler today.\\nOriginally published by Fox News',\n",
       " 'Speaker Nancy Pelosi unilaterally told six House committees to investigate without any rules or procedures. Pictured: Pelosi delivers closing remarks Nov. 1 at the Independence Dinner in Philadelphia. (Photo: Mark Makela/Getty Images)\\n\\nThomas Jipping\\n/\\n@TomJipping\\n\\nThomas Jipping is deputy director of the Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies and senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation.\\nMuch of the attention on House Resolution 660, adopted by House Democrats on Halloween to advance the impeach of President Donald Trump, has failed to note the significant differences with resolutions authorizing previous presidential impeachments.\\nTwo writers on the Lawfare blog, for example, claimed that HR 660 incorporates “a structure similar to what was in place for the Clinton and Nixon impeachment proceedings.” Simply placing the resolutions side by side shows this is false.\\nFirst, the previous resolutions authorized those impeachment inquiries at the outset; this one simply says “carry on” to committees that began investigating weeks ago.\\nSecond, the previous resolutions authorized only the Judiciary Committee to investigate whether impeachment grounds exist. On Sept. 24, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi unilaterally told six different committees to investigate without any rules or procedures.\\nThird, HR 660 sets procedures for public hearings in only two of the six investigating committees. The others are named in the resolution but told simply to “continue their ongoing investigations as part of the existing House of Representatives inquiry.” This apparently means that the other four committees can continue operating in secret, using procedures they make up as they go along.\\nFourth, the resolution creates a structure for subpoena authority in the Intelligence and Judiciary committees very different from what was in place for the Clinton and Nixon impeachments.\\nOn Oct. 8, 1998, the House adopted HR 581, granting subpoena authority to “the chairman and ranking member acting jointly.” If “either declines to act,” the other may act alone after bringing the matter to the committee to decide “whether such authority shall be so exercised.” HR 803, adopted on Feb. 6, 1974, included the same provision for the Nixon impeachment.\\nThe structure for subpoena authority in HR 660, however, is the opposite. It is not directed at both the majority and minority; in fact, it does not use the word “jointly” at all. Instead, the ranking minority member must have “the concurrence of the chair” to exercise subpoena authority, but not vice versa. If “the chair declines to concur,” the ranking minority member must bring the matter to the committee for decision.\\nIn other words, the chairman can act unilaterally, while the minority always needs the majority’s permission.\\nFifth, HR 581 explicitly said that, after committee approval, the ranking minority member can exercise subpoena authority “acting alone.” HR 660 deletes any mention of the ranking minority member actually exercising subpoena power, saying only that he or she may refer the matter to the committee.\\nAs if this significant departure from past impeachment procedures were not enough, there are even more radical developments brewing in individual committees. While HR 660 presents the Intelligence Committee as taking the lead, the Judiciary Committee has made its own move. Chairman Jerry Nadler, a New York Democrat, has released the committee’s own impeachment hearing procedures “pursuant to House Resolution 660.”\\nThese procedures appear to allow Trump’s counsel to attend and participate in any Judiciary Committee hearings. But there’s an enormous caveat. \\nSection F states that Nadler can impose “appropriate remedies” if the president “unlawfully” refuses to make witnesses available or to produce requested documents for any of the six investigating committees. These remedies include “denying specific requests by the President or his counsel under these procedures to call or question witnesses.”\\nRemember that four of the six House investigating committees can continue operating in secret, under whatever rules or procedures they choose. That investigative scheme, in fact, can be entirely different for each of those committees.\\nNadler claims the ability to determine when the president has acted “unlawfully” in relation to committees over which he has no authority. And, when he does (based on whatever standards or criteria he alone chooses), Nadler says he can bar the president—the impeachment defendant—from participating at all in the Judiciary Committee’s hearings.\\nThankfully, the Constitution’s impeachment provisions have not been used often in American history. But we do know how to conduct a presidential impeachment that is genuinely fair, legitimate, and that minimizes partisanship. \\nHouse Democrats have chosen to reject the example, counsel, and guidance of that experience and opted instead for a glaringly partisan, unbalanced, and novel process.\\nOriginally published by The Washington Times',\n",

(Photo: Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images)\\n\\nThomas Jipping\\n/\\n@TomJipping\\n\\nThomas Jipping is deputy director of the Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies and senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation.\\nAs House Intelligence Chairman\\xa0Adam Schiff, D-Calif., passed the impeachment inquiry baton to the Judiciary Committee this week, he said the central allegation against President Donald Trump is that the president “solicited foreign interference in the 2020 presidential election.”\\nThis accusation will likely be the heart of any articles of\\xa0impeachment\\xa0the Judiciary Committee produces against the president.\\nIf that’s the Democrats’ choice, so be it. But choices have consequences. If the Democrats go with solicitation, they’ll have to actually prove it.\\nAs House Democrats have pursued an impeachment, they’ve turned to focus groups to find the phrases that will serve them best. This marketing research led them to drop the “quid pro quo” accusation.\\nIt turns out most people realize a quid pro quo is nothing more than an exchange of one thing for another—something that happened this morning when I filled up my car at the gas station and I paid with my credit card.\\nAs the focus group feedback rolled in, Schiff shifted to words like “bribery,” “extortion,” or “shake-down.” Perhaps Democrats have now settled on “solicitation” for the same reason.\\nWhile specific terms may resonate more or less among focus groups, some of them also have specific legal definitions. Under federal law (18 U.S. Code §373), for example, solicitation of a crime of violence requires not only a specific intent but also that the solicitation occurs “under circumstances strongly corroborative of that intent.”\\nThe Justice Department’s Criminal Resource Manual\\xa0explains\\xa0that “the Government must establish that the defendant had the intent that another person engages in conduct constituting a felony crime of violence in violation of Federal law. The intent must be shown to be serious by strongly corroborative circumstances. Second, the Government must prove that the defendant commanded, induced, or otherwise endeavored to persuade the other person to commit the felony.”\\nThe whole impeachment ballgame comes down to whether Trump took certain actions in relation to Ukraine for the specific purpose of manipulating the 2020 presidential election. \\nThe House Intelligence Committee’s report states as its first finding of fact, for example, that Trump “solicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.”\\nLaw professors brought in for Wednesday’s Judiciary Committee hearing made the same claim. Harvard professor Noah Feldman claimed that in a July 25 telephone call, Trump urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy “to investigate his political rivals in order to gain personal political advantage, including in the 2020 presidential election.”\\nStanford professor Pamela Karlan similarly claimed that Trump sought “the aid of a foreign government in his reelection campaign.” Trump, she said, literally demanded “foreign interference in our elections.”\\nNo, an offense does not have to be criminal to be impeachable. But if Democrats are going to frame the case against Trump in terms of a recognized crime like solicitation and if they are going to claim that Trump acted with this intent, then they should have to prove it.\\nWhile Democrats have repeatedly claimed that Trump solicited foreign interference in the 2020 election, repeating a claim does not prove it.\\nIt is obviously insufficient, for example, to speculate that if Zelenskyy had done what Trump asked (he did not), it could have resulted in something Trump might have used next year in his reelection campaign.\\nLegitimate reasons for Trump’s request to Zelenskyy unrelated to the 2020 election increase the need for concrete, actual evidence of the intent that Trump’s critics claim.\\nAfter all, everything a first-term president does has the potential to affect his reelection prospects. And every first-term president takes actions, or takes actions in a particular way, with an eye toward just that end.\\nThe House Intelligence Committee hearings highlighted that Trump sometimes conducts foreign policy, including with respect to Ukraine, in ways that frustrate professional diplomats and Trump’s critics. OK, but is that evidence that Trump, in Feldman’s words, sought “personal political and electoral advantage over his political rival?”\\nIn the Judiciary Committee hearing Wednesday, George Washington University professor Jonathan Turley distinguished between “rage and reason.”\\nTrump critics, both in and outside of government, have whipped each other into a frenzy that appears to be affecting their judgment, Turley said.\\nSo far at least, they seem to be substituting “I wouldn’t put it past him” or “sounds like something Trump would do” for evidence that Trump acted with the intent required to establish what they say he did.\\nOriginally published by Fox News',\n",

Cities in Illinois\\nand Mississippi also prohibit anyone over the age of 12 from participating\\nin trick-or-treating activities.\\nChesapeake and other cities such as Belleville, Illinois, have attempted to defend their ordinances by claiming that they never before have been enforced, but, according to Chesapeake’s website, “give police an option, should things get out of hand on Halloween.”\\nChesapeake officials also point to an earlier occurrence, in the 1960s, where things did get “out of hand” because of some rowdy teenagers with fireworks. \\nIn defense of his city’s ordinance, Belleville\\nMayor Mark Eckert claims that it addresses fears held by “young single\\nmoms” and senior citizens of “big kids” in high school who have the ability to\\nact aggressively toward homes and homeowners. \\nNevertheless, the possibility of some older children acting\\nmischievously or even belligerently is no reason to criminalize the innocent\\nbehavior of thousands of others.\\nMost kids simply want to collect candy and spend a festive\\nevening with friends and families, and other laws already prohibit breaking and\\nentering, vandalism, or assault for those who do get “out of hand.”\\nCreating new laws to punish otherwise blameless behavior serves\\nno legitimate government interest and contributes to the growing problem of\\novercriminalization—the overuse and abuse of the criminal law to address every\\nsocietal problem and punish every mistake.\\nHeritage Foundation scholars have written extensively (see here,\\nhere,\\nand here)\\nabout overcriminalization, and, unfortunately, not even holidays like Halloween\\nare beyond its tentacles.\\nLaws that never have been enforced should not be kept around as potential safeguards against potentially bad behavior. \\nInstead of feeding the wild beast of overcriminalization, as communities reflect on their Halloween and kids recover from their sugar highs, cities with ridiculous bans on trick-or-treating should rethink their priorities and help combat the rampant spread of the misuse of criminal law.

The agency asserts, however, that the court can solve the\\nproblem by simply striking down the “for-cause” removal limitation, but\\notherwise preserving the agency.\\nIt may not get its way. The court is\\nat least considering whether to invalidate the entire agency.\\nIn its order accepting the case, the court asked the parties to answer this question: If the for-cause removal requirement is unconstitutional, can it be severed from the rest of the statute that created the bureau?\\xa0If it can’t be severed, then the court might invalidate the entire agency.\\xa0 \\nNotably, in his D.C. Circuit dissent, Kavanaugh wrote that he believed the for-cause requirement could be struck down while preserving the rest of the agency.\\xa0Whether he retains that opinion and whether his eight colleagues agree remain to be seen.\\nThe case is important because it presents an opportunity for the court to defend the separation of powers. The court notably missed another opportunity to do so last term in Gundy v. United States, when it upheld a broad delegation of law-writing authority from Congress to the attorney general. \\nIt should not miss another\\nopportunity, particularly where, as in this case, even the agency itself\\nconcedes that its structure violates the Constitution.\\nThe case also affords the court the\\nopportunity to correct the damage caused by the bureau’s unconstitutional\\nstructure. \\nAs The Heritage Foundation has discussed at length here, and then-law professor Neomi Rao, now a federal judge herself,\\xa0testified here, the unconstitutional structure of the bureau has led to abuses of its power that have caused economic harm and undermined the rule of law.\\xa0 \\nAt the very least, therefore, the court\\nshould invalidate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s decisions of the past\\nnine years because they’re products of an unconstitutional agency.\\nIn the meantime, however, the court should\\nnot miss this opportunity to tell Congress that when the Constitution says the\\nlegislative, executive, and judicial powers shall be separate, it really means\\nit.',\n",
       " '“It’s pretty simple,”\\xa0Rep. Rashida Tlaib,\\xa0D-Mich., tweeted last\\xa0March, in calling for President Donald Trump’s impeachment. “No one is above the law, including the President of the United States.”\\nBut perhaps Tlaib—among Trump’s harshest critics in\\xa0Congress—needs to follow up with another tweet, in the interests of transparency. This tweet could read: “No one is above the law. Except me.”\\nAccording to a\\xa0report\\xa0issued last week by the House Ethics Committee, there is “substantial reason to believe” that Tlaib used campaign funds for personal expenditures, thereby violating both campaign finance laws and House ethics rules.\\nThe alleged violations stem from $17,500 that her campaign paid her, apparently to cover personal expenses, after she was elected to Congress.\\nText messages and emails between Tlaib and her campaign staff show that throughout her campaign she repeatedly asked her campaign for money to cover personal expenses like “car maintenance, child care, and other necessities.”\\nAt one point, Tlaib asked her campaign to give her $2,000 every two weeks. Between May 7 and Nov. 16, 2018, it did so. Then, on Dec. 1, 2018, it paid her $15,500.\\nIn total, Tlaib’s campaign gave her $45,000 over seven months.\\nFederal\\xa0campaign finance law\\xa0(52 U.S.C. §30114(b)) prohibits the use of campaign funds for personal use. The law, including the\\xa0regulations\\xa0promulgated by the Federal Election Commission, defines “personal use” very broadly.\\nPersonal use includes any “commitment, obligation, or expense of a person that would exist irrespective of the candidate’s campaign duties.” That plainly includes car maintenance, child care, and “other necessities.”\\nAdditionally,\\xa0House ethics rules\\xa0prohibit representatives from using campaign funds for personal expenditures. They and their staffs are tasked with ensuring that their campaigns operate in compliance with the law.\\nWhile candidates may take a salary from their campaigns, there are very strict limits on that. Among the\\xa0litany of restrictions\\xa0is this one: The salary can only be paid for work performed before the election. The salary has to end the day the candidate is either elected or withdraws from the race and is no longer a candidate.\\nTlaib’s eligibility for a salary paid from her campaign funds ended on Nov. 6, 2018, when she was elected to the House of Representatives. Yet her campaign continued to pay her through the end of December. She collected $17,500 after the election.\\nTlaib’s lawyers concede that the payments were made after Nov. 6 last year, but argue that the money was for services performed before the election. But according to the report, documents taken from her campaign “suggest otherwise.”\\nA spreadsheet of campaign salary payments shows that Tlaib’s campaign paid her $2,000 on Nov. 16 last year for work performed between Nov. 1 and 15. And according to that same spreadsheet, the $15,500 paid on Dec. 1 was for work performed between Nov. 16 and Dec. 31 last year.\\nAdditionally, the checks confirm those dates, as do emails from Tlaib’s campaign treasurer. As to the $15,500 payment, her campaign treasurer’s records show that at least $8,000 of it was paid for work performed after the election, and the remaining $7,500 was an unspecified “adjustment.”\\nIt certainly appears to be a clear violation of federal law. Perhaps it’s no surprise, then, that the best arguments her lawyers can come up with are that there was no “conscious disregard” of the law, and that it’s “most irregular” for the Office of Congressional Ethics to look into pre-election activities.\\nIn other words, Tlaib should be excused because she didn’t bother to learn the law or because Congress should permit candidates to violate ethics laws with impunity until they get elected. It doesn’t take a lawyer to see how feeble these arguments are.\\nGiven how bad this looks for Tlaib, it’s no surprise that she and her campaign staff refused all interview requests from the Office of Congressional Ethics.\\nAnd Tlaib’s problems extend beyond the Ethics Committee.\\nBoth the Federal Election Commission and the U.S. Justice Department have jurisdiction over violations of federal campaign finance law. The FEC can force those who err to repay the money and impose a civil penalty – even where there was no “conscious disregard” of the law.\\nIf Tlaib “knowingly and willfully” violated the law, that is a criminal violation that comes under the jurisdiction of the Justice Department. Criminal violations of the law can result not only in civil penalties, but prison time.\\nWe agree with Tlaib that “no one is above the law.” Does she agree with her own tweet?\\nOriginally published by Fox News ',\n",

In a remarkable documentary by Michael and Gina Pack, “Created Equal: Clarence Thomas in His Own Words,” the famously silent justice tells his life story.\\xa0 And not just the small part that everyone has an opinion about, but his whole, and wholly astonishing, story. \\nAs memories of the facts surrounding his contentious\\nconfirmation battle—in which Anita Hill accused him of sexual harassment and\\nThomas vigorously defended himself—have faded with time, public opinion has\\nshifted against Thomas.\\xa0 \\nAt the time of his confirmation, the public was twice\\nas likely to believe Thomas over Hill (55% to 27%), and 58% favored his\\nconfirmation.\\xa0 Today, only\\n30% of Americans believe that he should have been confirmed, and 38% say he\\nshould not have been.\\nWhat accounts for these changing opinions? Mostly likely\\nit’s the relentless effort by Thomas’s critics over the last 28 years to tell his\\nstory in their own terms.\\xa0 They lost the\\nbattle against his confirmation, but they’ve never stopped fighting the battle\\nover his life story.\\xa0 Until now, Thomas\\nhas largely preferred to stay out of the fight with the exception of publishing\\nhis memoir, “My\\nGrandfather’s Son,” in 2007.\\nLike his memoir, the documentary follows Thomas’s journey\\nfrom poverty in rural Georgia to the Supreme Court.\\xa0 Along the way, he lives through segregation, starts\\nupon and then leaves the path to the Catholic priesthood, joins the Black Power\\nmovement, goes to Yale Law School, hesitantly joins the Republican Party, and\\nmarries the woman he calls “a gift from God.” \\xa0\\xa0\\nThomas talks about growing up speaking Geechee—a Creole language spoken by the descendants of slaves in Georgia—before Standard English.\\xa0 He relives his reactions to the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy, and explains how the prejudice of his fellow seminarians drove him from the church and into radical racial politics. \\nHe describes his slow turn away from those politics and tells\\nhow he decided to vote for Ronald Reagan.\\xa0\\nAnd, in a particularly raw moment, he reveals that the racist attacks\\nleveled at him ever since his confirmation continue to create fresh wounds.\\nPerhaps what makes Thomas’s story most interesting is that it is as much about the people in Thomas’s life as it is about him. He recounts the ways—big and small—that others shaped his life.\\xa0 From Sister Mary Virgilius, his eighth-grade teacher who wouldn’t let him waste his potential, to John Danforth, who as Missouri‘s attorney general gave Thomas his first job after law school when no one else would (despite his excellent grades). \\nHardly a moment goes by in the film when Thomas isn’t speaking about somebody else.\\nMost often, that person is Thomas’s grandfather who raised him until he later threw Thomas out of his house. \\xa0More than anything, the film is the story of how his grandfather shaped him, often against Thomas’s will, into the man he is today. Thomas’s grandfather was hardworking, fiercely independent, and strict.\\xa0 He lived his life by biblical principles and the sweat of his brow, and he taught Thomas those lessons.\\xa0 \\nHis grandfather’s lessons weave through Thomas’s life as he learns, rebels against, and finally embraces them.\\xa0Proverbs 22:6 seems to be the unifying theme to his story: “Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.”\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\nPerhaps, above all else, what makes Thomas’s story so\\npowerful is that it’s relatable.\\xa0 More\\nthan a rags-to-riches story, it’s the story of a person struggling to reconcile\\nhis passions with his family values and the world around him.\\xa0 \\nAfter all the noise and spin continually whipped up by\\npundits about Thomas, it’s refreshing to hear the man himself tell his\\nstory.\\xa0 And what a story it is.\",\n",
       " 'In the you-just-can’t-make-this-stuff-up category, we interrupt the impeachment proceedings to return to the Jussie Smollett drama.\\xa0 \\nThe latest head scratcher is the fact that Smollett has filed a two-count counterclaim against the city of Chicago, claiming malicious prosecution. That’s right. \\nSmollett is suing the city for malicious prosecution because he filed a bogus police report about a hate crime that didn’t happen, and in spite of the fact that Cook County prosecutor Kim Foxx let him off the hook for it.\\xa0That’s gratitude for you.\\nLet’s unpack this Alice-in-Wonderland comedy.\\nA quick refresher on the facts\\nis helpful. Last January, Smollett says he received a letter at the television\\nstudio where the show “Empire” is filmed, and the letter contained white\\npowder, had a stick figure hanging from a tree, with cutout letters saying,\\n“Smollett Jussie you will die black [expletive].”\\xa0 \\nSmollett told an ABC News crew that the return address\\non the letter said MAGA, a reference to the “Make America Great Again” Trump\\nmoniker. That case was turned over to the FBI, but we don’t know what, if\\nanything, the feds have decided to do about that allegation.\\nA week later, Smollett claimed that while he was\\nwalking home at 2 a.m., “two offenders who engaged in racial and homophobic\\nslurs” assaulted him, poured a liquid on him, put a rope around his neck, and\\npulled him by the rope.\\xa0 \\nAccording to a\\nlawsuit filed against him by the city of Chicago, Smollett\\nidentified at least one of his attackers as a white man.\\nThe allegations fell\\napart quickly when the police investigated the case. It\\nturned out that Smollett’s alleged attackers were not white, but black. \\nThe men were two brothers from Nigeria whom Smollett\\nknew. He had paid them $3,500 for, what he called, “personal training,” but according\\nto the brothers, Smollett actually paid them to stage the\\nattack because he was unhappy that his previous attempt to stage a threat\\nagainst himself (with a fake letter) didn’t get him much attention.\\nSmollett was eventually indicted on\\n16 related disorderly conduct offenses for making up the entire affair. Foxx,\\nwho was in charge of the office prosecuting Smollett, announced\\nthat she would recuse herself from the case because she had conversations with\\none of Smollett’s relatives about the investigation.\\xa0 \\nLater, however, Foxx announced that she had not really recused herself, and she subsequently dropped all charges against Smollett. She gave him a sweetheart plea deal: He was allowed to walk away from the case without admitting guilt, he forfeited his $10,000 bond, he was given credit for 16 hours of community service, and his case was sealed.\\xa0\\nChicago’s mayor-elect, Lori Lightfoot, supported the deal, saying, “This doesn’t rank as a matter of any importance to me.”\\nOthers, us\\nincluded, thought that something wasn’t right about the plea\\ndeal, and called for an investigation into this suspicious miscarriage of\\njustice. The Illinois Prosecutors Bar Association, for example, called it\\n“highly unusual” and not representative of the “honest ethical work”\\nprosecutors are supposed to provide on a daily basis. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe city of Chicago then sought reimbursement for the\\n$130,106 it spent investigating the hoax. When Smollett refused to pony up the\\nmoney, they sued him in federal court.\\xa0 \\nSmollett’s attorneys tried to get the case tossed out,\\nbut U.S. District Court Judge Virginia Kendall said last month, “This will be going\\nforward.” The next hearing in federal court is Feb. 18, 2020.\\xa0 \\nMeanwhile, in Illinois state court, a Cook County\\njudge appointed a special prosecutor to look into the entire fiasco, including\\nhow and why the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office came to offer Smollett\\nthe deal of the century.\\xa0 \\nSmollett got off a lot easier than he should have, but his counterclaim against Chicago shows he’s committed to pretending that he was the victim in this docudrama.\\xa0 \\nSmollett was booted\\nfrom the last season of “Empire” as a result of his false allegations. This may\\nbe the only drama he can star in, for now. ',\n",
       " \"Nothing proved Attorney General William Barr's point quite as well as the barrage of spite and vitriol that the left hurled at him for this speech. (Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\\n\\nGianCarlo Canaparo\\n/\\n@GCanaparo\\n\\nGianCarlo Canaparo is a legal fellow in the Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies at The Heritage Foundation.\\n\\nKaitlynn Samalis-Aldrich\\n\\nKaitlynn Samalis-Aldrich is an administrative and research assistant at the Meese Center for Legal and Judicial Studies.\\nRarely does a U.S. attorney general get such blowback for a non-televised speech at a university. Yet that’s what happened to Attorney General William Barr.\\nOn Oct. 11, Barr gave a\\nspeech at Notre Dame Law School that began with the unremarkable\\nobservation that “[f]rom the Founding Era onward, there was a strong consensus\\nabout the centrality of religious liberty in the United States.”\\nBy the time he finished that speech, left-wing writers were\\npounding their keyboards with hair-on-fire indignation. Here’s what Barr said\\nthat got them so worked up.\\nThe founding generation’s view of human nature “was drawn\\nfrom the classical Christian tradition,” which is essential to our system of\\ngovernment. That system, he explained, enshrines and defends individual liberty\\nand, therefore, has little ability to rein in “the unbridled pursuit of\\npersonal appetites at the expense of the common good.”\\nFor that reason, he continued, the Framers placed their\\ntrust in “the self-discipline and virtue of the American people,” and relied on\\nreligion to provide those virtues. It does so by helping to “teach, train, and\\nhabituate people to want what is good.”\\nBarr continued by pointing out the growing effort to replace\\nthe Judeo-Christian moral system with “secularism and the doctrine of moral\\nrelativism.” Traditional religious values are not decaying, he said, but rather\\nare the target of “organized destruction.”\\nHe argued that secularists have attacked religion and those who hold religious beliefs with “social, educational, and professional ostracism,” lawsuits, and social media campaigns. Those who practice their faith publicly are shamed or sued into submission, while those who hold their beliefs privately are encouraged to keep their beliefs quiet under threats of public censure or ridicule.\\nThe law, he argued, has been used to subdue religious expression\\nand to force religious people to participate in practices antithetical to their\\nfaith. \\nPresident Barack Obama’s administration, for example, sued\\nto force religious employers to provide abortifacient coverage in health plans.\\nMeanwhile, states have passed laws requiring public schools to adopt LGBT advocacy\\ncurricula that are inconsistent with traditional Christian teaching and have\\nmade it illegal for parents to take their children out of those classes.\\nThis is not “live and let live,” Barr argued, but rather an\\neffort to “[compel] people to violate their conscience.” \\nWhile he called for people to emphasize “the moral education\\nof our children,” he recognized that “[t]he times are hostile to this.”\\nNothing proved that point quite as well as the barrage of\\nspite and vitriol that the left hurled at Barr for this speech. The response in\\nleft-wing media outlets was astonishing, both for its reluctance to engage with\\nBarr’s arguments and its willingness to throw invective at him instead.\\nThe Chicago Tribune, for example, ran\\na piece accusing Barr of telling atheists to “go to hell.” Of course, Barr\\nsaid no such thing. The New York Times’ reliably temperate Paul\\nKrugman said that we should all be scared of Barr’s speech because “it’s\\nthe language of witch hunts and pogroms.”\\nYet another writer\\ndeclared that Barr’s speech made him feel “not just uncomfortable” but “disturbed.”\\nClutching his pearls, he wondered how Barr could even mention Judeo-Christian\\nmorals working for “such an unprincipled, morally bankrupt, fornicating,\\nmendacious president.”\\nBut the most amusing display of foot-stomping histrionics\\ncame from The\\nNew Yorker, which threw at Barr nearly every adjective its thick-prosed know-it-alls\\ncould pull out of Webster.\\xa0 \\nNot only was it “the worst speech by an attorney general of\\nthe United States in modern history,” it was “historically illiterate,”\\n“morally obtuse,” “willfully misleading,” “vague,” “obscure,” “galling,” and\\n“potted.”\\xa0 \\nPotted? \\nNever mind. Let’s see if Barr’s speech really deserved the\\nChicken Little hysteria it received.\\nMichael Farris, writing\\nin The Hill, has already shown that Barr’s speech lined up with bipartisan\\nsentiments in the 1990s when President Bill Clinton signed the Religious\\nFreedom Restoration Act into law. So let’s go further back and compare Barr’s\\nsentiments to the Founders’.\\xa0 \\nIs Barr’s vision of religion’s role in America really the potted\\npogrom his critics say it is? \\nIt doesn’t seem like it. On the contrary, it echoes the\\nFounders’ understanding that religion was paramount to the health and longevity\\nof the union. \\nIn his Farewell Address,\\nGeorge Washington noted that “morality is a necessary spring of popular\\ngovernment,” and that morality cannot exist without religion. \\nJohn Adams said, “Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.”\\xa0 \\nThe list of similar quotations from other Founders is long\\nand uniform in this sentiment. The Founders all came from similar Christian\\ntraditions and recognized that those values were essential for a government\\nthat afforded its people enormous freedom. \\nIt’s for that reason that the First Amendment protects\\nreligious freedom from government meddling by declaring: “Congress shall make\\nno law respecting an establishment of religion.”\\nThat’s not to say that each individual Founder was deeply\\npious. Some were not at all. But still they recognized what Barr reiterated:\\nthat the Christian tradition encourages a needed and irreplaceable morality in\\nthe people. \\nModern-day secularists might like to erase religion’s\\ncentral role in our history, just as they’d like to drive religious viewpoints\\nfrom the public square today. But they should instead see the value that\\nreligion brings and embrace the freedom of religious people to practice their\\nfaith free from government coercion.\\nBarr did that in his speech, and his Justice Department is\\nputting his words into action.\\nUndermining his critics’ claim that Barr cares only about\\nChristians, Barr’s Justice Department continues to defend the religious\\nliberties of Muslims,\\nChristians,\\nJews,\\npractitioners\\nof Native American religions, and\\nmore. This effort is not only constitutional, but also praiseworthy.\\xa0 \\nAt the end of the day, what Barr did was provide historical\\nbackground to the First Amendment’s first guarantee, and affirm our\\nresponsibility to stand up for it. That’s hardly something to get upset about.\",\n",

No one comes out clean.\\nAnd as recent\\ncomments by Senior Judge Paul Friedman of the U.S. District Court for the\\nDistrict of Columbia show, that holds especially true for judges. \\nFriedman jumped into the political mud pit on Wednesday to wrestle President Donald Trump, saying that Trump’s criticism of judges who rule against him feeds into a “destructive narrative” and that Trump’s criticisms have only gotten worse over time.\\nFriedman has a point, but he does more harm than good in making it. Yes, some of Trump’s criticisms of judges have been too hot, but Friedman accomplishes nothing by entering the fray.\\xa0 \\nOn the contrary, he only contributes to the increasing\\nperception among the American people that judges are just politicians\\nhiding their partisan agendas behind black robes.\\nNo institution has more to lose by being covered in political muck than the judiciary. Impartiality and the appearance of it are paramount to the judiciary’s integrity. \\nThe Code of Conduct for United States Judges hammers that theme home. It explains that public confidence in the judiciary’s impartiality is indispensable to justice. And when the judiciary loses the public’s confidence, it “injures our system of government under law.”\\nFor that reason, the code forbids judges from engaging in political activities.\\xa0 \\nIn fact, the code prohibits a lot of behavior that non-judges take for granted: serving on the board of a public company, accepting certain gifts, participating in political organizations, making speeches for or against politicians, donating to political causes, engaging in “any other political activity,” and more.\\nJudges don’t even have the luxury of setting their\\npersonal priorities as “[t]he duties of judicial office take precedence over\\nall other activities.” \\nJudges are judges first, individuals second, and aren’t\\nsupposed to do anything that “detract[s] from the dignity of the judge’s\\noffice” or “reflect[s] adversely on the judge’s impartiality.”\\nIt’s a monastic calling, and it should be. \\nThe integrity of our system of government rests on every\\njudge’s shoulders. Every judge is an ambassador for a judiciary whose effectiveness\\ndepends on its ability to preserve untarnished in the minds of the American\\npeople the ideal of Lady Justice.\\nJudges succeed as Lady Justice’s ambassadors the way courthouse\\ncolumns succeed at holding up a classical entablature: By upholding the rule of\\nlaw “without fear or favor.”\\nFriedman, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton,\\nseems to have forgotten the code. That’s understandable, because judges are\\npeople, after all, with all the same passions as the rest of us, which are\\neasily inflamed in these hyperpartisan times. But it’s still not excusable.\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\nAnyway, what good can Friedman do the judiciary by entering the political fray?\\xa0Can he stop the president from attacking judges?\\xa0Certainly not.\\xa0 \\nCan he reassure the public that the judiciary is above the fray?\\xa0Not while he’s standing in it.\\xa0 \\nJudges’ perceived impartiality depends on them staying above the fray.\\xa0It defies human nature to let an attack go unanswered, but judges have to.\\xa0More than their pride is at stake.\\nThat’s not to say the judiciary is without a defense for political attacks. Others, especially lawyers, teachers, and civic-minded citizens, should come to their defense when warranted. \\nJudges can also preempt political attacks by teaching people about the value of the separation of powers and an independent judiciary.\\nBut when judges enter the political mud pit, even for good reason, they just get mud on their robes.',\n",

Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act, however, prohibits that direct contact, requiring instead that complaints follow a process that begins with the intelligence community inspector general.\\nIn like fashion, this second individual, who claims to have firsthand information regarding Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has chosen to talk to the media through his or her lawyer, rather than file a complaint.\\nAccording to the lawyer, this\\nperson has firsthand knowledge of some of the allegations included in the first complaint\\nand has spoken to the inspector general.\\nUntil this official files a complaint and it’s made public, we have no idea whether his or her account will, as the media have reported, bolster the secondhand and thirdhand information recounted in the first complaint. Until we see his or her complaint and the information actually detailed in it, the information the media report that his lawyer told them is still secondhand.\\nNaturally, that hasn’t\\nstopped the media from calling this a “firsthand” account and speculating\\nwildly about its impact on Democrats’ impeachment efforts. The New York Times,\\nfor example, claims that it “would potentially add further credibility to the\\naccount of the first whistleblower.”\\nThere’s that word again:\\n“whistleblower.” \\nThe media often use it, but all we know is that the second person has something to say that his or her lawyer has shared with the media. How does that make him or her a “whistleblower”? For that matter, is the first person a whistleblower?\\nLet’s start with the law that protects intelligence officials who blow the whistle.\\xa0The key provision of the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act is codified in Title 50 of the U.S. Code Section 3033.\\xa0 \\nThe law does not define or even use the term “whistleblower,” except in the title, but it does clearly identify the people it’s designed to protect.\\nTo be covered by the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act, a would-be whistleblower must (1) be an employee of the intelligence community or of an intelligence community contractor, (2) who intends to report to Congress a complaint or information, (3) with respect to an urgent concern, and (4) who follows the disclosure procedures set forth in the act.\\nThe act defines “urgent\\nconcern” as a problem, abuse, or deficiency relating to “an intelligence\\nactivity within the responsibility of the Director of National Intelligence.”\\nThat’s the most concrete way we have of defining a “whistleblower.” Those criteria show that this second person is not a whistleblower at all. \\xa0\\nFor one thing, we have no evidence corroborating the lawyer’s assertion that his client is an intelligence official. For another, there is no indication that he or she intends to submit a complaint to Congress. \\nAs far as we know, he or she hasn’t even submitted a complaint to the inspector general or otherwise followed any of the act’s disclosure procedures.\\nThe first so-called whistleblower, doesn’t match the statutory description either.\\nThe subject of his or her complaint, the Trump-Zelenskyy phone call, does not meet the statutory definition of “urgent concern.” As the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel explained, the Trump-Zelenskyy call did not involve “an intelligence activity within the responsibility of the Director of National Intelligence.”\\nOn the contrary, it\\nexplained, the call was “a confidential diplomatic communication between the president\\nand a foreign leader that the intelligence-community complainant received\\nsecondhand.”\\nWhat’s more, the first “complainant,” as the Justice Department rightly calls him or her, violated the law’s disclosure procedures and even might have broken the law in going straight to Schiff’s staff.\\nTo many people, the term “whistleblower”\\nbrings to mind a well-meaning, honest person who, possibly at personal risk or\\ncost, selflessly comes forward with evidence of wrongdoing. It’s a meaningful\\nterm. \\nBut this exercise in political spin, which applies “whistleblower” to people who are not, undermines legitimate efforts to expose wrongdoing.\\xa0 \\nThese individuals are more like political double agents hiding behind the act, their lawyers, and a friendly press to snipe at a president they don’t like while cloaking themselves with the mantle of reluctant and dutiful public servants. \\nWe’re not buying it.',\n",

These are crimes defined\\nby executive branch agencies pursuant to authority delegated to them by the\\nlegislature.\\xa0 \\nMost criminal regulations do not cover things we typically consider “criminal” like murder or burglary. Instead, they’re things like providing criminal penalties for violating complex rules for selling bedding or transferring money. \\nSuch activities may seem less serious than traditional\\ncrimes, but they can result in equally serious jail time.\\nAs Heritage Foundation scholars have said time\\nand time\\nagain, regulatory crimes are a problem. It’s all but impossible for the public\\nto know them all, and yet, as the maxim goes, ignorance of the law is no\\nexcuse. You will pay a fine and may go to jail if you accidentally mislabel\\nbedding.\\xa0 \\nIn the case of the federal government, experts\\nestimate that there are more than 300,000 regulatory offenses carrying\\npotential criminal penalties. Americans have been sent\\nto prison for breaking laws they didn’t even know existed and which did not\\ninvolve inherently blameworthy conduct.\\nTaking note of this problem, North Carolina passed a law in\\n2018 that required state and local agencies to report to the legislature all of\\ntheir rules that carried criminal penalties. Many agencies failed to comply,\\nand so, last month, the state enacted SB 584.\\nSection 3 of the law sets a new compliance deadline, and Section\\n5 adds a penalty for noncompliance: Any agency that fails to report to the\\nlegislature in a timely manner loses its power to enforce new criminal rules for\\ntwo years.\\nAdditionally, Section 6 automatically refers all new criminal\\nregulations proposed by state agencies to the legislature’s General Statutes\\nCommission, which will then review them and make recommendations to the general\\nsession whether any of the regulations should have their criminal penalties\\nremoved.\\nThe law is an excellent first step to getting a handle on\\nrunaway regulatory crimes. North Carolina has correctly recognized that\\nregulatory crimes are a problem, that to address that problem it must take inventory\\nof its regulatory crimes, and that the legislature should retain its authority\\nto review and vote on all crimes that the state creates.\\nThe federal government should follow North Carolina’s\\nexample.\\nFor years, The Heritage Foundation has supported efforts to\\ncount the federal criminal laws contained both in the United States Code and in\\nthe Code of Federal Regulations. The Department of Justice and several\\nnon-governmental organizations have tried, and failed, to do so.\\nBut who better than to count criminal regulations than the\\nagencies that promulgated them? And what better way to encourage that effort\\nthan to forbid agencies from enforcing new crimes if they don’t comply?\\xa0 \\nAfter all, if an agency is unable to count the crimes it has\\ncreated, it cannot be trusted to enforce more.\\nCongress should put aside political differences and rally in\\nsupport of a federal law mirroring SB 584.\\xa0\\nNorth Carolina’s law passed the Republican-majority state legislature\\nwith overwhelming\\nbipartisan support and was signed by its Democratic governor.\\xa0 \\nThis is an issue that people on both sides of the aisle\\ncan—and often do—agree on. A federal law that requires executive agencies to\\ncount their criminal rules wouldn’t just be good policy, it would be a much-needed\\nwin for bipartisanship. ',\n",

The defendants did commit mortgage fraud, but the government didn’t prosecute them for that. \\nIn fact, for\\nreasons unknown, the prosecutors ignored that crime for five years until the\\nstatute of limitations expired.\\xa0 \\nThen, realizing that their delay cost them a mortgage fraud conviction, the prosecutors searched the criminal code for some law that might let them prosecute the defendants anyway. They settled on bank fraud, even though the defendants’ crime didn’t fit the bill. \\nBut the court refused to expand the law because the bank fraud statute “is as straightforward as they come” and plainly did not cover mortgage fraud. It ordered that the defendants be acquitted.\\nThat was the\\nright outcome. \\nYou might counter, “The defendants were guilty of something.

       " '\"We have tough battles here, but they are winnable to the extent that we will follow the word of God,\" Pastor Jim Garlow says. (Photo courtesy of Josh Shepherd)\\nSeated in the House gallery, one man watched the vote on the Conscience Protection Act with all the intensity of a general going into war.\\nOn July 13, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the bill, which\\xa0intended to protect the rights of health care providers, churches, and other groups that object to participating in abortion.\\nJim Garlow, father of eight children and pastor of Skyline Wesleyan Church in San Diego, California, sat with his wife and a dozen congregants who prayed and discussed events unfolding on the House floor. While others visit the nation’s capital city for summer vacation, this team came with purpose.\\nNearly two years ago, Garlow was thrust into a battle with the state of California when his church objected to a new state mandate involving abortion. Since then, he has found that pro-choice bias in state and federal government is no casual affair.\\n“They are ruthless,” Garlow says.\\nYet his church refuses to bow to the state. Represented by Alliance Defending Freedom, its\\xa0lawsuit against California is ongoing.\\nIn an interview with Bound4LIFE—a faith-based, pro-life organization—following the vote, Garlow discusses how he testified before Congress, his personal connection to life issues, and the covert strategy he sees at work in politics today.\\xa0\\nBound4LIFE: What recent events in California led your church to file a lawsuit against the state to defend your pro-life convictions?\\nGarlow: On August 22, 2014, some nameless, faceless bureaucrat at the Department of Managed Health Care in Sacramento made a decision by fiat: that every insurance provider in the state of California had to include elective abortion in our plans.\\nI found out about that decision 60 days later. An attorney who assists us at Skyline Church said, ‘You’re now covering abortions in your insurance.’ I said, ‘There’s no way.’ ‘No, you are.’ ‘Surely not—we would’ve been notified or something! We would’ve seen this in the media?’ I asked our team to follow-up about it and that attorney was right. We were being forced to pay for abortions, and in fact everyone in California is.\\nWe began to ask what we could do—what is our legal recourse? There were many conference calls. We appealed directly to Kathleen Sebelius, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services at the time. She stalled our inquiry forever and did nothing. HHS would not enforce the law as written, which protects our rights.\\nA number of churches, hospitals, as well as Christian universities, both evangelical and Catholic, filed a complaint against the federal government. On June 22, a federal agency dismissed that coalition complaint. Our church filed a separate lawsuit against the state of California in a federal court, which is currently ongoing.\\nPastor Jim Garlow watched the vote on the Conscience Protection Act, which the House passed on July 13. (Photo courtesy of Josh Shepherd)\\nBound4LIFE: Are there specific policies already enacted that protect medical professionals—or any citizens—who do not want to be involved in abortion?\\nGarlow: If you’re an OB-GYN doctor or a nurse, and you refuse to perform an abortion, there are several federal statutes that protect you. The Hyde Amendment is the most well-known, prohibiting federal funding of abortion. There’s the Church Amendments—not named for “church,” like a congregation; it refers to Frank Church, former senator from Idaho.\\nThere’s also the Coats-Snowe Amendment, named for Dan Coats and Olympia Snowe. They are two people on opposite sides of the abortion issue, but they agreed that people should not be coerced to be involved in abortion.\\nBut the Weldon Amendment, named after Congressman Dave Weldon who is a medical doctor, is the most relevant. The Obama administration has twisted the Weldon Amendment in such a way that, if any medical professional objected to providing abortions, they can be fired with no right to litigation.\\nIt’s bizarre. When the law is violated, people always have the right to sue—but now none of these people could. On top of that, churches are also coerced to cover abortions.\\nI testified this past Friday before the Energy and Commerce Committee—their subcommittee on Health, chaired by Congressman Joe Pitts of Pennsylvania. I flew home, preached in San Diego, then flew back here Monday to speak to congressional staff about this issue—60 key people influencing their bosses, who are members of Congress.\\nWe’ve been in meetings one after another with congressmen, specifically bringing up the Conscience Protection Act and how it helps correct these issues. I also have a new book called ‘Well Versed: Biblical Answers to Today’s Tough Issues;’\\xa0a\\xa0team from Skyline Church came as volunteers and hand-delivered copies to all 535 members of Congress. They believe the message is that important.\\nBound4LIFE: Now the vote just ended on this bill, how does it correct the issue of government discrimination against medical providers and churches like yours?\\nGarlow: We had a victory moments ago, when the Conscience Protection Act passed by a bipartisan majority vote of 245-182 in the U.S. House. Our team was seated in the House gallery praying. Now it will proceed to the U.S. Senate, where it will hopefully be voted on this fall.\\nThis week, I’ve been sitting with attorneys who’ve been using all this legalese—some of which I did not follow, quite frankly. Let me approach the specifics in layman’s terms. This bill tightens the screws down on these amendments already enacted. It gets rid of this notion that you cannot sue if you’re coerced into providing an abortion. That’s the quick and easy way of understanding it.\\nThis bill would take out the language where they twisted the Weldon Amendment to mean something different. The Obama administration released a statement last night saying the president would most certainly veto this bill if it arrives at his desk because it would ‘limit women’s health care.’\\nThey are completely ignoring the reality of the shift. When they push for certain policies, the left at first says, ‘Let us do this—you’ve just got to tolerate it.’ Then next they say, ‘You’ve got to affirm it.’ And finally they say, ‘No, you’ve got to participate in this activity.’ In this case, they want us to participate in the killing.\\nThey attempt these three levels every time: toleration, affirmation, participation. They are ruthless. They have no respect for the First Amendment rights of the Constitution.\\nBound4LIFE: For someone who does not hold pro-life convictions, why should they support this bill?\\nGarlow: Tonight, we had three Democratic members join the majority in voting for this bill. Now the Democratic Party, according to its platform, is unashamedly pro-choice—I would call it pro-abortion, to be honest.\\nMany leaders mentioned earlier who wrote these amendments, such as Senator Frank Church, were Democrats who said that a person’s conscience should not be violated. There’s been a fair amount of bipartisan support for conscience rights, because this policy is not fundamentally about the issue of abortion.\\nRather, it addresses:\\xa0Is the First Amendment going to be respected? That question is on two levels. On one level, there are those of us who uphold the sanctity of life based on biblical reasons—we can point to chapter and verse, as well as church doctrine.\\nOn a second level, there are atheists who object to abortion and they don’t have to give a theological reason for that. It’s a matter of conscience for them, period. No one should be forced to do something they find offensive.\\nThis was emphasized strongly in the Energy and Commerce subcommittee forum. Two of us testifying were pastors, while two others were conscientious objectors whose stand for life was not tied to theological reasons. No American should be forced to participate in abortion.\\nBound4LIFE: You noted your role as a pastor. Sometimes speaking of the value of every life seems distant or political to people. How does Skyline Church live out your pro-life beliefs?\\nGarlow: It concerns me that we live in a culture where people wonder, ‘Why should we care about a pro-life position?’\\xa0How ludicrous is that! The average person uses the word ‘abortion’ with far too much ease. When I was in front of the congressional committee, I said, ‘Let’s call it what it is: Abortion is dismembering a human being, ripping them to shreds. Innocent blood is flowing in the streets of our cities.’\\nAt Skyline Church, we are activists. We hold accountable those in public life. We also adopt babies—I’ve adopted four myself. One of my adopted children is an adult now, who has adopted children. My wife passed away a number of years ago and I remarried, then I had stepchildren; one of my grandchildren\\xa0is adopted.\\nMy daughter-in-law, whom I claim as my own, runs an adoption ministry. So she’s standing for life full time on the frontlines. Some of our congregation goes out to abortion centers for the purpose of praying and reaching out in compassion. When I pastored in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, I was heavily involved on that important front.\\nBound4LIFE: You mention Texas, which was at the center of a recent Supreme Court decision seen as a setback for the pro-life movement. Do you have hope as a pro-life pastor?\\nGarlow: I do have hope. The pro-life movement is very encouraging to me as a pastor. How we’re seeing the next generation take a stand against abortion is thrilling.\\nI have a cautious optimism, built on whether this nation has a critical mass of people who are willing to repent of sin, hold leaders accountable, and refuse to tolerate the kind of actions we’ve seen going on. We have tough battles here, but they are winnable to the extent that we will follow the word of God.\\nReprinted with permission from Bound4LIFE.\\nThis article has been corrected to reflect that it is one of Garlow’s grandchildren, not stepchildren, who is adopted.',\n",

The report also finds 23 percent of dads stay home due to a failed job search — a story Roy Baldwin of Colorado Springs, Colo. knows all too well.\\nAfter a work transition, Baldwin became primary caregiver to his three children, he related in an interview with The Daily Signal.\\n“A few years ago my family experienced some pretty significant life changes, with unemployment being one of them,” Baldwin recounted. “I vividly recall my wife and I sitting down in tears, re-looking at our plans and dreams for our family.”\\nHe begins to relate the emotionally complex time at arm’s length. “In some situations, wives may feel like they’re carrying the burden of being the primary breadwinner and missing out on being involved as the primary caregiver for the kids, and husbands may struggle with feelings of inadequacy. I know that was our experience.”\\nBaldwin noted he found “amazing support” during this time through the National At-Home Dad Network, devoted to providing education and advocacy for fathers who are primary caregivers.\\nThe group recently stated their concerns with the new report in a detailed response, writing in part:\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 “While we are ecstatic to see Pew Research speak about their being over 2 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 million stay-at-home dads in the United States in 2012, we also have major \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 concerns with their definition…\\nTheir study is not truly about ‘stay-at-home dads,’ but rather about dads of young \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 children who are unemployed. There is a difference.”\\nBaldwin landed a full-time position again in 2009 — as Director of Parenting and Youth at Focus on the Family, a nonprofit ministry dedicated to helping families thrive.\\nHe stresses the uptick in men becoming stay-at-home dads — some for only a season — points to a positive trend of fathers taking a more active role in their children’s lives.\\n“I’ve seen many men who are doing an excellent job as stay-at-home dads. At a broader level, we’re seeing more and more dads engaging with their families,” Baldwin says with enthusiasm. “Today’s dads are finding a greater sense of purpose and identity in their roles as fathers, whether they’re in the workforce or staying home with the kids.”\\n“Children thrive when their dads are involved, so it’s been encouraging to see so many men step up to the plate when it comes to investing in their kids.\\xa0This needs to be celebrated and embraced.”\\nHe also highlighted the Pew report’s bottom line: 84 percent of stay-at-home parents are moms rather than dads.\\nAs a contributor to Focus on the Family’s Dad Matters blog. Baldwin integrates the wisdom gleaned from his own experiences, other experts on-staff, and over 5,000 counseling calls the Christian ministry fields every month.\\nSo what should families consider if dad is taking on the role of caregiver at home for a time?\\n“We recommend a couple be intentional about talking things out to make sure they’re on the same page,” Baldwin advises. “It goes back to making sure the arrangement is best for their particular family during the season of life they’re in.”\\nEven though his own time as a stay-at-home dad wasn’t easy, Baldwin says “that experience drew us closer together in ways that I will always treasure.”',\n",
       " 'Photo: Andre Jenny Stock Connection Worldwide/Newscom\\nTexas is getting under some people’s skin.\\nIts population is growing. Its people are becoming more prosperous. It is creating both billionaires and employing more minimum-wage workers than any other state. Its energy sector has thrived—year-over-year drilling has doubled so far in 2014, with 10,000 new wells drilled just since January. Its technology corridor now extends for hundreds of miles along I-35.\\nTexas is the hottest state economy this side of North Dakota. But some still refuse to acknowledge the Texas Miracle.\\nThe recovery benefits only the rich, they say. Pro-business means pro-big-business. Job growth has merely kept pace with population growth.\\nBut that’s just it. People are moving to Texas, and it certainly is not for the weather. Its population has grown more than 5 percent just since 2010—a rate exceeded only by North Dakota, another oil-boom state, and the rapidly gentrifying District of Columbia. California, by contrast, lost congressional seats for the first time in state history after the 2010 census.\\nTexans see this growth everywhere they go.\\n“You kind of look around and see your neighbors are driving a little nicer car or you realize the restaurants are a little bit more crowded than they used to be or there might be a little bit longer line at the ballpark for hot dogs or something like that,” said Patrick Jankowski, a Houston-based economist. “Everyone is benefiting from what’s going on.”\\nAs the steady drumbeat continues, including job growth and improved livelihood in Texas, the naysayers have distilled their argument to two main points—the oil and gas revolution blocks renewable fuels or the Texas Miracle is actually a statistical mirage.\\nThe first of these complaints is dead on.\\nCheap and plentiful oil and gas is beating subsidized, expensive and unreliable solar and wind energy hands down. Much to the chagrin of solar industry lobbyists, as National Journal pointed out in a recent story–“Why Is Texas Terrible at Producing Solar Power?” –Texas refuses to subsidize one form of energy when another is so plentiful, so prosperous on its own and so capable of employing thousands of citizens.\\n[Solar] has also taken a beating from economic forces. Electricity is typically dirt cheap in Texas, making it hard for any power plant to turn a profit, especially one with high up-front costs like a solar farm. And the fracking boom has stiffened competition for solar energy as the supply glut and resulting price dip in fuel prices has made natural-gas power plants a more attractive option.\\nExactly. And that’s what makes the facts of Texas’ economic strength difficult for critics to refute.\\nTexas goes light on regulation, charges no state income tax, reduces barriers to entry and creates a dynamic business climate. California charges high taxes, imposes significant regulations, makes it hard to start a new business and has billions of dollars in debt for pensions owed to retired public employees.\\nSo it should come as no surprise Texas’ business climate is rated in the top 5; California’s is in the bottom 10. Texas has had four times the job growth of California over the last 20 years. Its unemployment is about 50 percent below California’s and its incomes are growing at a faster pace than California’s.\\n“For Californians to pretend that they are doing as well as Texas is a great delusion,” said former Reagan economist Arthur Laffer, who himself moved from California to Tennessee.\\nNicolas Loris, who studies energy and environment issues as the Herbert and Joyce Morgan Fellow at The Heritage Foundation, says the growth in Texas’ oil and gas sector benefits other Texans and even those beyond its borders.\\n“Economic opportunity created by the fracking revolution does not stop in oil and gas industries, but ripples throughout the U.S. economy,” Loris said. “The abundance of cheap, fracked natural gas has fueled employment growth in the manufacturing sector by making U.S. companies more competitive. And lower energy costs have given Americans more disposable income, which encourages further growth.”\\nHeritage Foundation Chief Economist Stephen Moore noted this week that, without the jobs that have been created in the oil and gas industry, the United States would have produced no net jobs over the last five years.\\n“These are cheap, abundant and made-in-the-USA jobs producing forms of electric power,” Moore said.\\nMoore will address energy policy and state wealth-creation in an upcoming Heritage event on Thursday. It is centered on his new book, An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of States. Moore co-authored the book with Laffer and philanthropist Rex A. Sinquefield, also speaking at the Heritage event.',\n",

Lakey.\\nAbortion providers, including Whole Woman’s Health Clinic in McAllen, Texas, sued the state to keep key provisions of H.B. 2 from being enforced. The law passed the Texas House by a bipartisan majority of 96-49 and was signed into law on July 18, 2013.\\n“States are free to regulate the practice of medicine for the safety of patients,” states Allan Parker, an attorney and pro-family legal advocate present in the courtroom during the hour-long hearing. As president of The Justice Foundation, Parker and his legal team filed a brief in support of the state.\\n“Texas now has a pro-life legislature,” he continues. “Surely the will of the people in this area should be the law. Most people want to protect human life and protect women.”\\nThe passage of H.B. 2 in Texas is regarded as a landmark event in the pro-life movement, spurring other states to enact similar common-sense protections for women and pre-born babies.\\nThe Justice Foundation’s legal brief documents testimonies of 3,279 post-abortive women and the negative effects of abortion on their lives.\\n“We represent women who have suffered injury after having an abortion,” Parker says. “Years later, many still deal with psychological injuries and emotional scars: suicidal thoughts, depression, anxiety, and nightmares.”\\nThe 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard a challenge to H.B. 2 (Photo: Goetz/CC BY-NC-ND 2.0)\\nMedical research studies on health risks faced by post-abortive women have multiplied in recent years. “Texans, and in fact all Americans, need to be involved in protecting women’s health and protecting the lives of children,” stresses Parker.\\nOral arguments in this court case centered on whether two major provisions of H.B. 2 were constitutional: requiring abortion centers to have the same safety standards as ambulatory surgical centers, and mandating that doctors performing abortions have admitting privileges in a local hospital.\\nThe New York Times reports that the three-judge panel “also criticized a lower court for voiding the entire surgery-center law, rather than specifying which parts were justified and which were not.”\\nParker notes that the line of questioning on physician admitting privileges seemed to reveal the judges’ support of this requirement.\\n“Directing these doctors to have hospital admitting privileges does not bother true medical professionals at all,” Parker says. “That’s just part of good medical practice.”\\nJonathan Mitchell, solicitor general of Texas who argued on the state’s behalf, faced more difficult questions around raising abortion centers’ health and safety standards up to ASC requirements.\\n“There is some cost involved to widen hallways and increase sanitary conditions in a clinic,” Parker acknowledges. “At least one of the judges was not convinced on the need for this type of requirement.”\\nH.B. 2 mandates abortion centers improve health and safety standards (Photo: E. Gatti/CC BY 2.0)\\nAfter interviewing more than 3,000 post-abortive women for The Justice Foundation’s court brief, Parker challenges this reluctance.\\nIn a botched abortion, a woman ends up needing to quickly go to an emergency room—which is why these abortion centers need doorways and hallways large enough for a gurney. The woman also needs continuity of care once in the hospital, rather than an abortionist who is nowhere to be found.\\nIn line with many court observers, Parker believes the three-judge panel will uphold H.B. 2.\\n“The judges want to support the will of the people through their elected legislature if they can,” says Parker. “The state presented a lot of compelling evidence that would allow the judges to do that.”\\nThis court case is the latest episode in a nearly two-year struggle, as Texas legislators have prioritized saving defenseless pre-born lives. A decision from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals is expected within a matter of months.',\n",

In June, he and his family won a contentious Supreme Court case,\\xa0a decision hailed by the pro-life movement as a victory for religious freedom.\\nPhoto: Museum of the Bible\\nThe Washington Post recently chronicled Green’s personal journey to becoming chairman of Museum of the Bible:\\nThe product of an Oklahoma family filled with pastors, Green has long been driven to spread the story of the Bible. He has poured millions into translation projects in developing nations and is a major benefactor to conservative evangelical universities, including Oral Roberts and Baylor.\\nAfter purchasing a few valuable artifacts beginning in 2009 during the economic recession, within a few years Green gradually acquired one of the world’s largest collection of biblical relics and manuscript—now nearly 50,000 items, from the time of Abraham (father of the Jewish nation) to the modern era.\\nGreen’s team of scholars preview the museum’s vast collection in a new video:\\n\\n“We have all sorts of artifacts that tell the story,” says Bennett. “Stained glass windows, Julia Ward Howe’s hand-written ‘Battle Hymn of the Republic’ lyrics, Dead Sea Scroll fragments—and we place them in immersive environments.”\\nPhoto: BRC Imagination Arts\\nBut Green will not purchase merely any relic. “Each item in the collection helps tell one of three stories,” notes Bennett.\\nShe explains, “First, to reveal how the Bible was translated and transmitted throughout the ages; to demonstrate the Bible’s impact on culture, including government, the arts, sciences, even humor; and finally, to demonstrate the narrative of the Bible itself, with artifacts that illustrate the stories.”\\nPhoto: Josh Shepherd\\nThe heart of the eight-story museum will be those three narrative ideas—entire floors dedicated to the Bible’s\\xa0historical journey, narrative stories and global impact.\\nPhoto: Smith Group JJR\\n“We take a strong scholarly approach with the museum; this is not about proselytizing, rather tracing the Bible’s journey across history,” says Bennett.\\nShe hints that other prominent institutions are catching the museum’s vision, noting, “We are in discussions with other prestigious international museums regarding their potential involvement in the D.C. project.”\\nPhoto: Josh Shepherd\\nEven the artistic elements of the museum, like stained glass, will tell part of the story. “Stained glass is significant because, in the Middle Ages, most people were illiterate,” Bennett explains. “People learned the stories of the Bible through the stained glass.”\\nPhoto: Josh Shepherd\\nThe museum’s unique blend of ancient art, touchscreen technology and in-depth scholarship is no small project.\\nAs the New York Times reports, “Adding up the value of over 40,000 planned artifacts, the real estate and the cost of renovations, the museum is an $800 million venture.” While Green and his family are the primary backers, a larger campaign to involve others in the project is underway.\\nPhoto: Josh Shepherd\\nCary Summers, chief operations officer for Museum of the Bible, explained in a recent interview why Washington, D.C., was chosen for the museum.\\n“Because the city is known as a destination for world-class museums, studies conducted by the museum team found that the Museum of the Bible would be best attended in Washington as opposed to other cities,” he says.\\nPhoto: Josh Shepherd\\nAs community relations director, Bennett has cultivated relationships with many faith-based groups in the area.\\n“Whether it’s a policy group like Family Research Council or prayer groups like Justice House of Prayer and David’s Tent, God has called so many people to Washington who are passionate about His Word and about our nation,” she notes.\\nPhoto: Josh Shepherd\\nBennett believes the museum will be a connecting point for many diverse groups driven by a faith grounded in the Bible. “I had someone come up to me crying the other day and say, ‘We’ve been waiting for something like this for so long.’”\\n“God has given me the gift of encouragement,” she says. “This is really the answer to so many prayers that have been lifted up over many years.”\\nPhoto: Josh Shepherd\\nDr. Josephine Dru, a biblical scholar featured in the museum’s new video, states, “We’re trying to do justice to the wide range of people who have claimed this book as their own—and have participated in its becoming one book.”\\nPhoto: Josh Shepherd\\nGetting to this point, with construction now in full-swing, has been quite a journey as the extensive Washington Post story notes:\\nIn July 2012 the museum’s board purchased for $50 million the 430,000-square-foot Washington Design Center, a massive red brick building that was built in 1919 as a refrigerated warehouse.\\nBennett picks up the history of the building. “Virginia Railway trains used to unload their produce here; with the invention of freezer cars, this building fell into disuse until the 1980s.”\\nPhoto: Josh Shepherd\\nShe continues, “John F. Kennedy’s father Joseph purchased it and opened the Washington Design Center, which for decades has served as a showroom for high-end furniture makers.”\\nThese custom designers and artisans have now moved 15 blocks away, to the newly christened Washington Design Center in Northwest D.C., allowing interior demolition work to proceed.\\nPhoto: Josh Shepherd\\nFor Museum of the Bible, the building is only one element of the development process underway. Both live-action and animated film content—to be shown as “holograms and on video screens that re-enact historical scenes related to the Bible” as a recent report stated—are in production.\\nTo use the biblical vernacular, watch and pray for more details to come.\\nPhoto: Smith Group JJR\\nOriginally appeared on Bound4LIFE.com.',\n",

(Photo: Icon Media Group)\\nThe creator of the independent film “Voiceless”\\xa0hopes to shift the national conversation about unplanned pregnancies by showing the impact one church can make through local outreach and pro-life advocacy.\\n“My struggle has always been with the church, as it has been having confrontation with the world,” says Pat Necerato, a street preacher turned filmmaker who wrote and directed “Voiceless.”\\n“I wanted to create a film to challenge the church to get involved in the public square,”\\xa0Necerato says.\\nWith a budget of nearly\\xa0$1 million and slated for release\\xa0Oct. 7 in hundreds of theaters, “Voiceless”\\xa0aims higher than most faith-based films in terms of production quality.\\nBut it’s the story and true-to-life script, born from Necerato’s own experiences, that make it uniquely suited to help move the pro-life cause out of cultural stalemate.\\n“Voiceless”\\xa0will premiere Oct. 2\\xa0in Washington, D.C., at a most unlikely venue: \\xa0a large screen outside the U.S. Supreme Court.\\nFive Years in the Making\\n“You always write from personal experience,” Necerato, 46, says. “I was pretty much all of the characters in this movie at one point or another.”\\n“Voiceless”\\xa0centers on Jesse Dean, an Army veteran who moves to Philadelphia with his wife to work at a local church. While his hands-on outreach gives him inroads into the community—teaching free boxing classes, for starters—it begins a series of increasingly tense conversations within the church.\\n“Voiceless” director Pat Necerato, right, and executive producer Stuart Migdon on the streets of Philadelphia. (Photo: Icon Media Group)\\n“I cannot tell you how many times I’ve heard Christians, even pastors, say: ‘We need to be saving souls, not so much worried about confronting evil,\\'”\\xa0recalls Necerato, echoing a key scene in the movie:\\nThose words never really jibed well with my theology that Christ is king, he can redeem any aspect of our world, and he has called Christians to be saved and be a part of it. That’s the big picture.\\nOne of my favorite lines in the movie is when Jesse says, ‘We are saved for the world, not from the world.’ It encapsulates the theme of ‘Voiceless’ and it speaks to my personal background—urging the church to confront the evils of society.\\n“I was a street preacher, and I still am,” Necerato, who lives in\\xa0Trenton, New Jersey,\\xa0says. “Rather than some stereotype of a crazy guy screaming on the corner, being a public witness can be done in a God-honoring way. Where evil is being lifted up unchallenged, I believe we can go out and proclaim the Gospel there just as strong.”\\nAnswering Hard Questions\\nWhile popular culture tends to\\xa0present abortion as merely political, “Voiceless” reframes the issue in moral, cultural, and personal terms.\\n“What is right? What should we be doing—a mercy ministry? Should we be prioritizing individuals? Should we be confrontational?” Necerato asks. “I wanted to create a movie that could address some of those questions with a real-life guy in real-life situations.”\\nJocelyn Cruz, the co-lead in “Voiceless,” has a personal connection to the film’s focus on lives in the womb.\\nCruz, whose previous roles in the hit movies\\xa0“Marriage Retreat” and “This Is Our Time” helped her land the part, points to how the abortion center in the film has a sign out front that states “empowering and protecting.”\\nFilmed in Philadelphia, “Voiceless” shows how one local church pursues community outreach. (Photo: Icon Media Group)\\n“Empowering and protecting women, children, and families at large is one of my passions,” Cruz says. “I am a trained postpartum doula, so I work with families right after birth. I get to see and experience firsthand how important it is to have a community of people around you while raising a child.”\\nIn a way that complements the director’s perspective, Cruz says other questions are also at the heart of “Voiceless.”\\n“How can we best empower [pregnant] women by helping them? How can we be there for them when they have the babies? How can we work with and support the family?” asks Cruz, whose character in the film plays a pivotal role rescuing\\xa0women who are vulnerable to abortion.\\n“A mother can only give as much as she has, so I feel it’s of extreme importance to help them fill up their storehouse so they can best take care of their new child,” Cruz says.\\nProduction Packs a Punch\\nWith the script complete and budget secured, Necerato and his team sought out a location to shoot “Voiceless”\\xa0while simultaneously beginning the casting process.\\n“I wanted it to have a gritty and gray working-class look to it. Choosing Philadelphia fit with that: the architecture, the L-train—the whole ‘Rocky’ feel of the city,” Necerato says, adding:\\nMetaphors are used throughout the story, with Jesse being a war veteran who was fighting for our country; then coming home, and now fighting to protect life and stop violence. He is a boxer who ends up teaching boxing. Shooting ‘Voiceless’ \\xa0in Philly was really about the aesthetics of the film reflecting underlying themes.\\nRusty Joiner portrays an Army veteran whose community outreach includes boxing classes. (Photo: Icon Media Group)\\nFor Cruz, filming on location in the City of Brotherly Love was an adventure.\\n“This was the first time I’ve shot a movie outside of California, so it was really fun getting to travel to Philadelphia and experience a different part of the country,” Cruz says.\\nThe movie also stars Hollywood actors Rusty Joiner (“CSI: Miami,” “ER,” “Bones”), James Russo (“Beverly Hills Cop”), and Paul Rodriguez (“Ali”). But\\xa0it\\xa0also highlights locally based\\xa0actors in key roles.\\n“I believe we were able to capture some of the best talent coming out of Philadelphia: Brian Wilson, who starred in ‘Creed,’ Christopher Mann from ‘House of Cards,’ Susan Moses, and many others,” Necerato says. “Our casting director Melanie Forchetti and I rolled up our sleeves and saw over 200 auditions to arrive at this exciting ensemble cast.”\\nAt the Northeast Film Festival, “Voiceless” stars Joiner and Victoria Gates took home best actor and best supporting actor awards for their performances. \\xa0The pro-life indie movie also won best feature film.\\nWith a national release on the horizon, the true accolades for cast and crew will be audiences connecting with the story.\\nSpeaking Life Into Personal Pain\\nNecerato says he hopes his\\xa0film will spark conversations.\\n“There are all kinds of reasons—political, spiritual, and emotional—that people avoid talking about abortion,” he says.\\n“Voiceless”\\xa0addresses issues surrounding unexpected pregnancies in a holistic manner. Scenes of counseling and prayer outside an abortion center are paired with a heart-wrenching subplot: An African-American family is\\xa0strapped for resources and unsure how to make room for another baby.\\n“I know some women personally who have had abortions,” Cruz says. “I can see there is still a lot of pain. Women feel trapped in a way and are scared to raise a child on their own. This is something most people don’t talk about, but it is very real.”\\n“Voiceless” reveals that issues surrounding unplanned pregnancies are complex. (Photo: Icon Media Group)\\nStuart Migdon, executive producer for “Voiceless,” recalls how he and his girlfriend were pressured as teens by family members to have an abortion when they faced an unexpected pregnancy.\\n“Though we had no idea of how we were going to make it, we never thought about an abortion,” Migdon says in a recent interview. “We didn’t hesitate—we got married. We struggled for a while but pressed on. God knew what he was doing.”\\nNecerato brings up another personal aspect of the issue.\\n“We see abortion as a women’s issue, knowing how much women suffer physically and emotionally from it,” the director says. “But men also suffer from having these incidents in their past. We often try to sweep it under the carpet, doing anything we can to ease our conscience.”\\nReferring to how taxpayer dollars flow every year to abortion providers\\xa0such as Planned Parenthood, Cruz has her own idea of how funding should be prioritized.\\n“Family counseling and postpartum support are services that can absolutely be afforded with the amount of money some groups like Planned Parenthood alone receive in government subsidies,” she says.\\nFrom Belief to Strategies That Save Lives\\nAsked about the diverse spheres of the pro-life movement, Necerato says, “In the battle to save lives, there is no one absolute approach. But the common denominator is always compassion and a heart of love.”\\nHe sees prayer at abortion centers as a vital front for pro-life advocacy:\\nWe are fighting an extremely weighty spiritual battle. When I’m at an abortion clinic, there is a different spiritual heaviness. Unless you’re prayed up, people out there on the front lines are not going to be spiritually equipped to endure this.\\nWe are called very clearly from scripture to pray unceasingly. We could win decisively in the legal arena or other battles, but without prayer it’s not going to have the force and power.\\nPerhaps it’s no coincidence that “Voiceless” premieres just as 40 Days for Life ramps up its largest-ever national prayer campaign, while the pro-life organization Bound4LIFE marks 12 years praying at the Supreme Court.\\nCruz and Necerato both emphasize how true convictions must be lived out with actions.\\n“We have to pray and go, pray and move, pray and act,” the director says.\\n“Voiceless” opens nationwide Oct. 7.

       " 'Remember Obamacare? The fight is far from over on the future of the Obama-era health insurance overhaul.\\nRepublicans are making a list-ditch effort this year to turn the program and the money over to the state. This isn’t full Obamacare repeal, but would make a world of sense because states would be free to experiment and find ways to reduce costs and provide better services.\\nDemocrats are adopting a new political spin, which is that everything is fine with Obamacare. They claim that the only reason premium and deductible costs keep exploding is because President Donald Trump repealed the individual mandate tax—which was nothing more than an unfair penalty on low-income families that can’t afford the high cost of the health law’s mandates.\\nBut if Trump is to blame, why were the costs skyrocketing two years before Trump even entered the Oval Office?\\nThe clear-eyed reality is that things aren’t going well with Obamacare. The predicted death spiral in the insurance market—higher costs cause more healthy people to drop coverage, which raises prices even more, and the cycle continues—is now irrefutably upon us. This law should really be renamed the UCA: the Unaffordable Care Act.\\nHere are eight reasons Obamacare needs to be repealed now, more than ever.\\n1. Health insurance is more expensive than ever.\\nRemember the promise that the average family would save $2,500 a year on health insurance? Forget about it.\\nIn May 2017 the Department of Health and Human Services reported that average health insurance premiums doubled since 2013. How many families’ incomes doubled over that same period?\\nIn 2018 costs have risen by another 19 percent for high-cost plans and 32 percent for the cheapest plans, according to a study by the Urban Institute. Overall inflation for all other goods and services are running at 2 percent.\\n2. Entitlement spending has exploded.\\nObamacare has driven entitlement spending up much faster than expected. The projected budgetary cost of Obamacare subsidies and Medicaid expansions from 2018 to 2027 now totals $4.8 trillion. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that Obamacare and its Medicaid expansion are responsible for 44 percent of the projected future increases in entitlement spending.\\n3. Obamacare has not stopped the stampede of rising health care costs.\\nInstead of “bending the cost curve down,” national expenditures on health care continue to rise.\\nThe year before Obamacare was fully implemented, health care amounted to 17.2 percent of U.S. gross domestic product. Last year that tab grew to 18.3 percent—an increase of almost $200 billion in health spending. The latest forecast for 2025 is that medical expenses will reach almost 20 percent of GDP.\\n4. Americans are paying more money for less health coverage.\\nAccording to Kaiser, the average deductible for people with employer-provided health coverage last year was $1,221 compared to $303 in 2006. Usually, you pay higher deductibles for lower premiums. Under Obamacare, you pay more when you get your hospital bill.\\n5. Fewer insurance choices.\\nAccording to federal and state data of insurer exchange options per county, more than 50 percent of our nation’s counties have only one insurer in 2018. Over 30 percent of counties are limited to two insurers. This means roughly 4 of 5 counties will have either just one or two Obamacare exchange insurers to choose from.\\n6. Medicaid enrollment is exploding.\\nThe vast majority of Americans who have received insurance under the Obamacare law have enrolled in Medicaid. Medicaid enrollment has soared from 55 million to 74 million since 2013. Yet many physicians, health clinics, and hospitals don’t accept Medicaid. This means tens of millions of Americans often can’t choose the doctor, hospital, or treatment of their choice.\\nMedicaid users in major cities experience an average denial rate of 47 percent. Mid-sized city Medicaid users have an average denial rate of 40 percent.\\n7. Nearly 30 million Americans still uninsured.\\nOn April 1, 2014, standing in the Rose Garden at the White House, President Barack Obama claimed that the Affordable Care Act meant “everybody” would have health insurance. Today, some 30 million Americans remain uninsured to this day.\\nWhy? Families can’t afford the insurance.\\nIn 2012, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that Obamacare exchange enrollment would increase by 9 million by 2016. Instead, an underwhelming 400,000 increase occurred, which is a staggering 96 percent reduction in the anticipated growth of net-ACA exchange enrollment.\\n8. Obamacare continues to ignore obvious cost-saving alternatives.\\nObamacare does not allow patients to buy insurance across state lines, which would dramatically increase competition and lower costs. It does not allow small business-associated health plans. It limits low-cost health savings accounts options. It has no provisions for capping medical malpractice costs—because Democrats were bought off by the trial lawyers.\\nLet’s summarize what we have gotten for our money under Obamacare. We have spent hundreds of billions of dollars already; we have massively increased the size of the federal budget; we have subsidized insurance plans to get Americans to sign up for Obamacare; we have penalized people if they don’t buy Obamacare (until that law was repealed); but we still have almost 1 in 11 Americans without insurance.\\nHas there ever been a bigger public policy flop?\\nI recently debated a high-ranking Obama White House economist and asked him: What was the greatest accomplishment of Obama in eight years in office? He replied: the Affordable Care Act.\\nReally? If this is Obama’s grand success, imagine how bad the failures were.\\nOriginally published by The Washington Times.',\n",
       " 'T.S. Eliot famously wrote that April is the cruelest month, but when it comes to America’s fiscal picture, nothing could be further from the truth about this past April. The latest government numbers confirm that last month was a blockbuster for growth, federal revenues, and deficit reduction.\\nOne of the key principles of Trumponomics is that faster economic growth can help solve a multitude of other social and economic problems, from poverty to inner-city decline to lowering the national debt.\\nWe’re not quite at a sustained elevated growth rate of 3 percent yet, but the latest economy snapshot tells us we are knocking on the door. The growth rate over the last four quarters came in at 2.9 percent, which was higher than any of the eight years of Barack Obama’s presidency.\\nHalfway through this current quarter, which began on April 1, the Atlanta Federal Reserve estimates growth at 4 percent. If that persists through the end of June, we will have reached an average growth rate of 3 percent under President Donald Trump.\\nNot bad, given that nearly every liberal critic trashed the president’s campaign forecast of 3 percent to 4 percent growth as an impossible dream.\\nEconomists such as Larry Summers, Obama’s first chief economist, gloomily declared that we were mired in a new era of “secular stagnation” and that 3 percent growth was unachievable. Paul Krugman of The New York Times said it was more likely we would see flying cars than 3 percent to 4 percent growth.\\nNow for the even better news. We are already starting to see a fiscal dividend from Trump’s tax, energy, and pro-business policies. The Congressional Budget Office reports that tax revenues in April—by far the biggest month of the year for tax collections because of the April 15 filing deadline—totaled $515 billion, which was a robust 13 percent rise in receipts over last year.\\nMoneyWeek reports that the $218 billion monthly surplus (revenues over expenditures) this April was the largest ever, with the previous record being $180 billion in 2001. (April is always the one surplus month.)\\nHere’s the simple lesson: more growth, more tax revenue.\\nBut there’s another lesson, and it is about how wrong the bean counters in Congress were who said this tax bill would “cost” the Treasury $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion in lost revenues over the next decade.\\nIf the higher growth rate that Trump has already accomplished remains in place, then the impact will be well over $3 trillion of more revenue and thus lower debt levels over the decade. Putting people to work is the best way to balance the budget. Period.\\nCritics will dismiss the importance of these higher revenue collections by arguing that the new receipts are for 2017 tax payments, which don’t take account of the tax cut that passed in December. This ignores that some of the growth we have seen was a result of the anticipation of the tax cut. Moreover, the fact that the tax cuts are just sinking in means that we should get even higher growth rates for the next several years at least.\\nAlas, it is not all good news in the April surprise. The inexcusable omnibus spending bill increased federal spending by some $300 billion in 2018, and we are starting to feel the impact of that splurge. Federal outlays are up 8.7 percent in April. That’s unforgivable, given that Republicans run everything in Washington these days.\\nNo one thought that Trump could ramp up the growth rate to 3 percent or that his policies would boost federal revenues. But he is doing just that—which is why all that the Democrats and the media want to talk about these days is Russia and Stormy Daniels.',\n",
       " 'Take a wild guess what country is reducing its greenhouse gas emissions the most? Canada? Britain? France? India? Germany? Japan? No, no, no, no, no, and no.\\nThe answer to that question is the United States of America. Wow! How can that be? This must be a misprint. Fake news. America never signed the Kyoto Protocol some two decades ago. We never enacted a carbon tax. We don’t have a cap-and-trade carbon emission program. That environmental villain Donald Trump pulled America out of the Paris climate accord that was signed by almost the entire rest of the civilized world.\\nYet the latest world climate report from the BP Statistical Review of World Energy finds that in 2017, America reduced its carbon emissions by 0.5 percent, the most of all major countries. That’s especially impressive given that our economy grew by nearly 3 percent—so we had more growth and less pollution—the best of all worlds.\\nThe major reason for the reduced pollution levels is the shale oil and gas revolution that is transitioning the world to cheap and clean natural gas for electric power generation.\\nMeanwhile, as our emissions fell, the pollution levels rose internationally and by a larger amount than in previous years. So much for the rest of the world going green.\\nThe world’s largest emitter of carbon dioxide emissions is China. According to the invaluable Institute for Energy Research, “China produces 28 percent of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions. India is the world’s third largest emitter of carbon dioxide and had the second largest increment (93 million metric tons) of carbon dioxide emissions in 2017, more than twice as much an increase as the U.S. reduction.”\\nFor every ton of reduced pollution the United States emits, China and India produce almost 10 more tons. This means it doesn’t really matter how much America reduces its greenhouse gases because China and India cancel out any and all progress we make.\\nThose who think they are helping save the planet by purchasing an electric car, or putting a solar panel on their roof, or trying to shut down coal production in the United States are barking up the wrong tree. If we want to stop greenhouse gases, there is no way to make progress without China and India on board—which they clearly are not.\\nThis latest data also demonstrates that despite all of the criticism across the globe and in the American media, Trump was completely right to pull the United States out of the flawed Paris accord. That might be one of the most universally violated treaties of all time—which is saying a lot. The chart below shows that nearly every nation that signed on to the Paris accord and has admonished America for not getting in has already broken its promises.\\n(Chart by The Washington Times)\\nNot a single EU nation is within 80 percent of its respective target for emission reduction, according to Climate Action Network Europe. In its official EU report, Climate Action Network Europe said, “All EU countries are failing to increase their climate action in line with the Paris Agreement goal.” All but five countries aren’t even at 50 percent of their current targets.\\nSo there you have it. The countries in the Paris climate agreement have broken every promise they’ve made and the nation that hasn’t signed the treaty is doing more than any other nation to reduce global warming. Yet, we are being lectured by the sanctimonious Europeans and Asians for not doing our fair share to save the planet. It’s another case study in how the left cares far more about good intentions than actual results. What matters is that you say that you will wash the dishes, not that you actually do it.\\nOriginally published in The Washington Times',\n",
       " 'President-elect Donald Trump has selected Andy Puzder,\\xa0CEO of Carl’s Jr., the successful fast-food hamburger restaurant chain, as his secretary of labor. This has set off a bit of protest by the hard left and the union bosses.\\nHow could Trump select someone who actually knows something about hiring workers and creating jobs? How dare he!\\nPuzder has grown Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s into a major U.S. employer with thousands of workers. He helped save the company and the employees. Big labor should be happy, right?\\nHardly. Puzder\\xa0has made a name for himself as a critic of Obamacare, many of the Department of Labor’s most mindless employment regulations, and a federal minimum wage hike.\\nHe understands fully as a front-line victim that President Barack Obama’s Department of Labor was mostly a jobs killer—pushing forced union work rules, new overtime mandates that hindered small businesses, and other nuisance regulations.\\nPuzder will hopefully bring a swift and welcome change to the culture of this agency. In the past, the Labor Department has been a rubber stamp for the union bosses’ agenda.\\xa0As an employer, Puzder knows what works and doesn’t work in the real marketplace for labor.\\nThat’s exactly why the left is mounting a loud and vicious campaign against him. Groups like the George Soros-funded Media Matters and the big unions are lambasting Puzder as someone who wants to “replace workers with robots” and who is leading the charge to keep wages low by opposing the “fight for $15” minimum wage hike.\\nBut these are spurious charges. On minimum wage, Puzder speaks common sense: He says he would support “minimum wage increases that are rational and do not destroy jobs or the businesses supporting them.” He is also of similar thinking to Trump: Leave the decision to the states.\\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates that even a $10.10 minimum wage\\xa0would kill 500,000 jobs, so a $15 minimum could bring job losses in the millions. That’s not pro-worker.\\nSimilarly, the left has distorted Puzder’s views on\\xa0automation and robotics. Puzder believes that mandated benefits like the minimum wage hikes are merely accelerating the move to automation in the restaurant industry. That is simply a well-substantiated fact. He has said many times that there are no robots that could replace the workers at Carl’s Jr.\\nPuzder has his finger on the pulse of the labor market. He predicted with great foresight that the Obamacare law would reduce hiring for businesses that near 50 workers—the employment threshold for the Obamacare regulations—and that the design of the Obamacare insurance would soon lead to a death spiral of rising costs in the market. He was right on both countsand for that too, the unions are out to bury him.\\nDoes being right disqualify one from serving in the Cabinet? Trump wisely with this pick says no.\\xa0Trump has also sent a message that he won’t knuckle under to the bullying tactics and the intimidation game that the left has engaged in for so many years.\\nThis is supposed to be the Department of Labor, not the Department of the AFL-CIO. Sure the union perspective should be at the table, but it shouldn’t own the table.\\nHere’s a statistic for Puzder to keep in mind: Where union presence is strongest in America—places like Detroit and Newark—jobs are disappearing fast. Where states have right-to-work laws and not forced union rules, job creation is twice as swift.\\nIf job creation is Trump’s top priority, he’s made a fabulous choice to run the Labor Department.',\n",
       " 'Time magazine’s cover story for the week of Nov. 6 is a classic. It blares: “The Wrecking Crew: How Trump’s Cabinet Is Dismantling Government As We Know It.”\\nThe New York Times ran a lead editorial complaining that Team Trump is shrinking the regulatory state at an “unprecedented” pace.\\nMeanwhile, last week the stock market raced to new all-time highs; we had another blockbuster jobs report with another fall in the unemployment rate; and housing sales soared to their highest level in a decade.\\nAre the editors at Time and the Times so ideologically blinded that they are incapable of connecting the dots?\\nThe U.S. economic revival of 3 percent growth has already defied the predictions of almost every Donald Trump critic.\\nI vividly remember debating Hillary Clinton’s economic gurus during the campaign: They accused Trump and advisers such as myself of “lying” when we said that pro-growth policies would speed up economic growth to 3 to 4 percent.\\nJason Furman, who chaired the Council of Economic Advisers under President Barack Obama, told reporters earlier this year that the chances of reaching 3 percent growth over a decade were about 1 in 25—which is what many political experts said was Trump’s chance of winning the election.\\nAnother Obama economist, Alan Krueger, called the 3 percent growth forecast “extremely rosy.”\\nLarry Summers, a top economic adviser to Obama, questioned the “standards of integrity” of the Trump economic team’s forecast for 3 percent (or more) growth. “I do not see how any examination of U.S. history could possibly support the Trump forecast as a reasonable expectation,” he wrote in The Washington Post.\\nCongress weighed in, too. “This budget relies on absurd economic projections and pretend revenues that no credible economist would validate,” Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., announced at a House budget hearing.\\nThe sharp-penned Paul Krugman of The New York Times declared Trump’s growth forecast an act of “economic arrogance.” He said the productivity improvement necessary for faster growth was as likely as “driverless flying cars” arriving “en masse.”\\nAdmittedly, we shouldn’t read too much into six months of very good economic data (with 3 percent growth) or the booming stock market. These trends can always reverse course quickly. Trump’s more restrictive policies on trade and immigration could harm growth potential.\\nBut so far the Trump haters have missed the call on the economy’s trajectory. Doubly ironic is that the same Obama-era economists who are trashing Trump’s increasingly realistic forecast of 3 percent growth are the ones who predicted 4 percent growth from the Obama budgets.\\nObama never came anywhere near 4 percent growth, and at the end of his second term, the economy grew at a pitiful 1.6 percent.\\nUnder Obama, free enterprise and pro-business policies were thrown out the window. What was delivered was the weakest recovery from a recession since World War II, with a meager 2.2 percent average growth rate. Middle America felt it, which is why Trump won these forgotten Americans.\\nOne reason that economist Larry Kudlow and I and others assured Trump that 3 to 4 percent growth was achievable was that Trump could capitalize on the underperformance of the Obama years.\\nUnder Obama, business investment fell almost two-thirds below the long-term trend line—thanks to higher taxes on investment. Now, partly in anticipation of the tax cut, business spending keeps climbing.\\nMaybe the liberal economists and their shills in the media should show some humility. They should acknowledge they were dead wrong about how much Obamanomics was going to grow the economy and about how Trumponomics would crash the economy and the stock market.\\nOr better yet, maybe the rest of us should all just stop listening to them.',\n",
       " 'Republicans have long been known as “the stupid party.” They do stupid things, such as waiting until mid-November to push a must-pass tax cut that should have been done by April.\\nBut in recent weeks the GOP has finally been showing some brains and some backbone on taxes. It is using its majorities in Congress to roll back and roll over the left, and it’s about time.\\nIn a more rational world, tax reform could have been bipartisan. But once Democrats declared they would be unified obstructionists on tax reform, there was no reason to throw a bone to the “resistance movement.” Playing nice with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., won’t buy any votes, so why bother?\\nIt’s hard not to be impressed with how Republicans have instead suddenly gotten very smart on the “pay fors” in their tax bill. Three of these revenue raisers are welcome policy changes, and they help defund the left.\\nStart with the elimination of the state and local tax deduction.\\nCongress shouldn’t subsidize flabby and inefficient state and local services and bankrupt public pension programs. Just as one would predict, the states with the highest taxes are Democrat-controlled states.\\nThere is no evidence that higher taxes in these states lead to better schools or safer streets. New York spends around $7,500 per person on state and local government, while New Hampshire spends less than $4,500. Yet public services are better in New Hampshire than in New York.\\nThe big blue states must cut their taxes and costs, or the stampede of high-income residents from these states will accelerate. The big losers here are the public employee unions—the mortal enemies of Republicans. This all works out nicely.\\nNext is the decision by Republicans to offset the cost of the tax cut by eliminating the individual mandate tax imposed mostly on moderate-income Americans.\\nAbout three of four people who pay the tax earn less than $50,000 a year. The purpose of the tax is to force low-income Americans to purchase insurance they either don’t want or can’t afford.\\nIsn’t it amazing that Obamacare provides subsidies to Americans if they buy the insurance and imposes penalties if they don’t, yet at least 13 million Americans still refuse to buy it? What a great product this must be.\\nEliminating the individual mandate will allow poorer and younger Americans to buy less expensive forms of coverage, such as health savings accounts. These additional options will lead to the slow death of Obamacare. Smart.\\nFinally, there is the proposed tax on college endowments. These are massive storehouses of wealth: Harvard and Yale combined sit on a nest egg of almost $60 billion, enough to give every student free tuition at these schools from now until forever. Instead, these university endowments act like giant financial trading dynasties, with very little of the largesse going to help students pay tuition.\\nThe GOP plan would put a small tax on the unspent money in the endowments if they don’t start spending the money down. My only complaint is that the tax is way too low. But the first shot against the university-industrial complex has finally been fired.\\nThe productivity of American universities, as Richard Vedder of Ohio University has documented, continues to decline. Vedder also found that university tuitions don’t go down when these schools have bigger endowments. They go up.\\nThese endowments subsidize the six- and seven-figure salaries of pompous, tired, and tenured professors (who teach four or five hours a week) and administrators. Bravo to Republicans for starting to turn off the spigot.\\nThe best indication that this is all working is the rise of what I call the “tax bill crybaby caucus.” This group consists of health insurance companies, Obamacare supporters, public employee unions, state and local officials, the welfare lobby, municipal bond traders, lobbyists, and, most of all, the liberal politicians who are funded by all of the above.\\nNot only are we getting pro-growth tax policy but also President Donald Trump and the GOP are finally draining the swamp. It doesn’t get any better than this.',\n",
       " 'It now appears that President Donald Trump’s intention regarding the North American Free Trade Agreement is to mend it, not end it.\\nThat’s good news because the trade deal has been a stunning economic success for Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Freer trade has meant steady increases in the volume of trade, greater competitiveness, and lower prices.\\nBut as Trump’s negotiators craft a NAFTA 2.0 deal, some things need to be fixed to assure America’s continued commanding heights in technology and innovation. Intellectual property rights—patents, copyrights, and so on—need to be better safeguarded.\\nThere have been abuses. In an unprecedented move, Canadian regulators recently ordered an American pharmaceutical company to lower the price of the company’s breakthrough treatment for a rare blood disorder.\\nCanada is inventing new rules to avoid paying American pharmaceutical and technology companies for their innovations and inventions. This is also happening in Europe, where bureaucrats are trying to expropriate funds from American technology leaders, including Google, through bogus charges of monopoly activities.\\nThe Trump administration should vigorously repel these economic attacks against American companies.\\nThis is a very big deal for the American economy. Intellectual property\\xa0is increasingly the lifeblood of our economy. Intellectual property-intensive industries support 28 million American jobs—or about 1 in 5 workers. About $6 trillion of our gross domestic product now is in intellectual property-related industries, including almost all of Silicon Valley.\\nMany of NAFTA’s intellectual property provisions do not prevent infringement of patent rights and, in some cases, outright theft (as in the case of China). This costs American consumers and businesses an estimated $200 billion annually.\\nConsider our drug companies.\\nAmerican pharmaceuticals recorded $47 billion in exports in 2015. Yet despite this and the fact that the vast majority of drug breakthroughs come from America, the U.S. currently has a $700 million trade deficit with Canada and only a tiny trade surplus with Mexico in biopharmaceuticals.\\nOur trade partners do not want their citizens to pay for the costs of the research and development required to invent these breakthrough medicines in the first place. It typically requires $500 million to $1 billion to develop a new drug or vaccine, and American consumers shouldn’t bear the entire burden of those costs.\\nIt drives up drug and health insurance costs in America, and it jeopardizes world health by delaying the development of future cures for cancer, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, Parkinson’s, and other terrible diseases.\\nEven worse, Mexico is producing “knockoff” drugs that are copycats of American pharmaceuticals. This is stealing, too, and negotiators should get tough on these practices south of our border.\\nThe same abuses are happening with American trademarks and copyrighted materials. NAFTA doesn’t sufficiently protect movies, music, and games from theft and distribution online.\\nNAFTA should impose civil and criminal penalties for illicit access to cable and satellite signals and other preventable infringements in which American firms are not compensated for use of the product.\\nThe future of free and fair trade depends on rigorous enforcement of America’s multitrillion-dollar intellectual property industries. This is about jobs—millions of them—and the rule of law.\\nIt is also about encouraging the very innovation that promotes prosperity and better health in America—which we then export across the globe to the betterment of mankind.\\nIt will also help boost public and business support for trade as a driver of growth in the years to come.',\n",
       " \"Andy Vanderplas\\n\\nAndy Vanderplas is a special assistant and research associate in The Heritage Foundation's Institute for Economic Freedom.\\nBusiness and homeowner utility costs could double in many states if environmental groups succeed in enacting draconian solar and wind power mandates in states across the country.\\nYet these mandates will have almost no impact in cleaning the air or reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\\nIn Arizona and Nevada, voters will decide on Nov. 6 whether to adopt renewable mandates requiring local utilities to buy at least 50 percent of their electric power from green energy—mostly, wind and solar power.\\nAt least a dozen other states are set to ramp up their mandatory standards (also called “renewable portfolio standards”) in 2019. California is set to move to 60 percent legally mandated renewable energy by 2030 and 100 percent by 2045.\\nThese mandates come with a steep price to American families and businesses. Residents in states with existing high mandates must often pay between 50 percent and 100 percent more on their electric bills than residents of states where utilities are free to rely on the market and purchase electric power from the lowest-cost sources—often coal, natural gas, or nuclear power.\\nBecause lower-income households spend five to 10 times more as a share of their incomes on energy than do high-income households, high renewable portfolio standards are a regressive—and unduly burdensome—tax on the poor.\\nIronically, these green initiatives are usually sponsored by billionaire liberal funders, such as investor Tom Steyer of California.\\nWhile the natural growth of renewable energy sources is a positive development, mandates are an economically disastrous method that crowds out the market for affordable electricity.\\nToday, the United States produces more than 75 percent of its electricity from natural gas, coal, and nuclear power. Less than 10 percent comes from solar and wind power.\\nGiven the massive federal subsidies of more than $150 billion between 2009 and 2014 to the wind and solar industries, that is an amazingly small percentage.\\nComparing the states with the most stringent renewable portfolio standards (25 percent or more) with the states with low ones (10 percent or less), and then with states with none, reveals a pattern.\\nStates with high renewable portfolio standards have electric power rates that are about 27 percent per kilowatt hour more expensive than states with low ones, and about 50 percent higher than states without them.\\nThe Heartland Institute estimates costs could total an extra $1,000 per year per household, compared with current electricity costs, at the proposed rate increase in Arizona.\\nThis could mean tens of thousands of dollars of higher costs for a business, depending on energy usage. For manufacturers, it could mean $100,000 or more of extra costs.\\nLower-income families would be most adversely affected by stricter green energy requirements. This is because poorer households typically pay about seven times more as a share of their income in energy costs than do wealthier families.\\nMiddle-class families pay at least twice as high a share of their income in energy bills than do the rich.\\nOne of the critical flaws of renewable energy requirements is that they almost all squeeze out two of the most dominant and cleanest forms of energy used across the country—natural gas and nuclear power.\\nBut from an environmental and clean air standpoint, and for the purposes of reducing greenhouse gases that may be linked to climate change, this distinction makes no sense.\\nIt appears simply to be a multibillion-dollar corporate welfare giveaway to the solar and wind industries at the expense of ratepayers.\\nEven coal that is burned in Arizona, Nevada, and other states is much cleaner today than it was 20 or 30 years ago. All of this is evidenced by the dramatic improvement in air quality nationally over the past 35 years.\\nOnly a small percentage of this clean air progress is due to renewable energy, because over most of this period, wind and solar power have been fairly inconsequential sources of U.S. energy production.\\nSince 1980, total emissions of the six principal air pollutants have fallen by 67 percent.\\nTo put that in perspective: That reduction occurred amid a dramatic expansion of the U.S. economy. Gross domestic product increased by 165 percent, vehicle miles traveled increased 110 percent, the U.S. population grew by 44 percent, and energy consumption increased by 25 percent.\\nFor these reasons, the “clean energy” initiative is best thought of as a regressive tax imposed on those who can least afford it.\\nAgain, this “tax” could cost middle-income and lower-income American families about $1,000 more per year in utility prices. These mandates could also negatively affect business productivity and move jobs to areas with more energy choices.\\nAmericans deserve affordable, abundant, and reliable energy. Renewable energy mandates are a “green tax” on homeowners and small businesses that can least afford it.\",\n",
       " 'President Barack Obama needs a reality check. Earlier this month in Indiana, he accused his critics of ignoring the “facts” and purporting “myths” about his economic record. But if Republicans are truly ignoring the facts, Obama should consider it a blessing.\\nA quick look at the facts will show that Obama’s economic performance has been weak—even by his own standards.\\nIn its budget for the fiscal year 2010, the Obama administration estimated that real gross domestic product would decline in 2009 by 2.8 percent that year and then increase by 2 percent in 2010.\\nFurthermore, the White House forecast that by 2011 its massive stimulus program would start paying off, with growth accelerating to 3.8 percent that year and then soaring above 4 percent from 2012 to 2014.\\nThe chart below compares Obama’s predictions to actual growth statistics from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.\\nSources: U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Office of Management and Budget\\nWhen it comes to economic growth, Obama has consistently failed to meet his own expectations. Not only has Obama’s economic recovery been the weakest of any post-recession recovery since World War II, but he is also on pace to become the first U.S. president in history to have never presided over a full year of growth averaging at least 3 percent.\\nBut is this really surprising? We know that Obama has done virtually everything wrong when it comes to\\xa0promoting growth.\\nHere’s a reminder:\\n1. Obamacare: When Obama pushed this boondoggle of a bill, he said on several occasions that it would lower health costs by $2,500 per family.\\xa0Instead, insurance premiums have risen— in some cases nearly 30\\xa0percent.\\xa0 On top of this, business owners are hiring fewer people to stay beneath the 50 employee threshold, which mandates business owners employing 50 people or more to provide full health insurance.\\n2. Regulation: It’s hard to grow, when the federal government is literally standing in the way of business.\\xa0 According to a recent Heritage Foundation study, More than $22 billion per year in new regulatory costs were imposed on Americans, costing Americans nearly $100 billion annually under Obama’s presidency.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n3. Taxes: Obama has raised taxes on investment income by nearly 60 percent (raising capital gains tax from 15 percent to 24 percent), and pushed the top marginal tax rate (the tax on small business owners) to 40\\xa0percent.\\xa0 The U.S. has the highest business tax rate in the world; causing companies to flee offshore (with jobs) to find a better deal elsewhere.\\nAfter nearly eight years of “hope and change,” wages are stagnant, growth is sputtering, entrepreneurship is in decline, our once great domestic companies are finding a better deal off shore, and more Americans are out of the work force than ever before.\\nThe “facts,” Mr. Obama, speak for themselves.',\n",
       " 'Christian Andzel\\n\\nChristian Andzel is a member of the Young Leaders Program at The Heritage Foundation.\\nThe Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 signed into law last week really should be renamed the Bipartisan Budget Crash Act.\\nThis spending spree takes a Mack Truck and rams through the hard-fought budget caps under the 2011 Budget Control Act to the tune of at least $300 billion.\\nWhen all is said and done, the fiscal wreckage could be worse than that.\\xa0With a federal debt already at $20.5 trillion, we have just lurched closer to fiscal insolvency.\\nRepublicans touted that they got $1 of new military spending for every $1 of domestic social programs, but even that is wishful thinking at best.\\xa0This calculation doesn’t include emergency disaster spending for hurricanes and fires, which was close to $90 billion. At least $21 billion of “defense” spending goes to the State Department instead, which does not fight wars.\\nIn the end, the domestic agencies may wind up with $2 of added funding for every $1 for national security, which is hardly a good deal for taxpayers.\\nIt also isn’t clear why the recovery efforts to pay for disaster relief should be paid for by the federal government.\\nIn the wake of some of the worst disasters in American history—the hurricane that wiped out Galveston, Texas, the Great Chicago Fire, and the San Francisco earthquake, for example—the rebuilding of these cities happened swiftly and was almost all funded by private businesses, private charities, and state and local initiatives, not by Washington writing a big check.\\nAnd when, alas, the feds do write big checks for disasters, the money should come from across-the-board cuts of 2 or 3 percent from all the other federal agencies—not by running up the debt.\\nThe Budget Control Act caps are now a victim of their own success. From 2011-2016, the spending caps held discretionary spending increases below the 2 percent level of inflation.\\xa0For three years, federal spending actually fell, in no small part because of those caps.\\nBut now those tight caps have been evaded four times in six years, and each time the overspending has been larger.\\xa0The cork has been pulled off the champagne bottle.\\nThe lack of spending restraint and the inability of Congress to keep its past legislative promises not only erodes trust in the political class, but shows a frightening and complete indifference by Washington toward our nation’s growing fiscal crisis.\\nThe big question is, where do we go from here on the budget? With neither party at all committed to reducing debt and deficits, our worry is that the budget caps are, for all intents and purposes, gone forever.\\nThe caps after 2020 are still technically in place, but the 2019 levels of spending are going to come in at as much as $200 billion above the 2020 caps. So either we see a massive cut in government spending in the election year of 2020, which would be a wonderful thing to behold—but is as likely as President Donald Trump and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi dancing a tango together—or, Congress throws the caps into the dustbin of history.\\nThat’s a scary prospect, because it would mean that Congress would be budgeting\\xa0without any fiscal guard rails or speed limits at all.\\xa0This will only invite further bipartisan spending sprees that are against the interests of the American people.\\nThe indefensible budget behavior of Congress over the last several weeks reinforces the case for Congress to extend the Budget Control Act caps into 2022 and beyond, since the caps expire at the end of 2021.\\nThese future caps should be based on the 2011 Budget Control Act’s average annual spending growth rate, not the new budget’s enormous spending growth rate. Failure to extend the caps would be a total surrender and a green light to the already out-of-control Mack Truck.',\n",

The bill increased domestic spending by almost $2 for every $1\\xa0of defense spending increases, in addition to the inclusion of emergency funds.\\nExamples of this overspending range from “small” million-dollar pet projects in Mississippi, New Jersey, and New York to billion-dollar increases compared to last year’s budget.\\nFor example, the National Institutes of Health received a $3 billion bump—an 8.8 percent increase from the year before—while the Department of Homeland Security’s federal assistance grants were awarded over 50 percent more than its budget estimates.\\nBy eliminating billions in international welfare, Congress could efficiently offset the tens of billions spent on post-disaster recovery in the United States. Instead, we see hundreds of millions actually going to other countries’ recovery efforts when the mission at home is left unfinished.\\nThe almost certain return of trillion-dollar budget deficits shows that Congress is no longer trying to steward the nation’s fiscal health. Our nation should not be spending hundreds of millions of dollars in disaster aid in foreign countries through the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance\\xa0when Florida, Texas, and Puerto Rico are still struggling.\\nThe spending bill did secure long-needed increases for the military. Those increases will pay for new weapons, ships, and other equipment such as drones. Specifically, it funds 14 Navy vessels, 90 fighter aircraft, and gives military personnel about a 2.5 percent raise.\\nMore funding will also go to military training, supplies, and equipment maintenance, which will directly support our military’s readiness and safety.\\nDespite these wins, the omnibus bill is a net loss as it concedes to Democrats on most domestic priorities, including giving $500 million of taxpayer funds to Planned Parenthood. In busting open the deficit, Republicans are jeopardizing the economic benefits of tax reform.\\nThose in Congress who care about the country’s fiscal health need to take swift measures to make sure this pattern doesn’t continue.\\nCongress should amend the Budget Control Act of 2011 to make the budget caps applicable to all federal spending (which includes entitlements) so that these one-sided results do not continue. This would also help reign in out-of-control entitlement spending, which makes up over 63 percent of Congress’ entire federal budget.\\nSecond, Congress should remove the defense/nondefense “firewall,” which allows special interests to shield their own priorities while disproportionally cutting others. Without the firewall, all discretionary spending would be subject to a single cap, which would force both parties to find more equitable cuts across the board and create more flexibility to stay under the cap each year.\\nThis solution would also reset the current “two for one” discretionary spending trap that takes hostage Congress’ constitutional duty to fund the military.\\nThis omnibus bill was unfortunately the final nail in the coffin for the 2018 budget. It tells the American people that despite politicians’ campaign promises and previous attempts to limit spending, Congress is now putting little effort into solving Washington’s fiscal crisis.\\nWithout meaningful correction, Congress will be poised to eclipse the profligate spending levels of the Obama era, thereby abetting our government’s fiscal decline.\",\n",

Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies at The Heritage Foundation.\\nFiscal restraint is dead in Washington, and no one seems to care.\\nThe March omnibus spending deal follows through on an agreement to spend significantly more over the next two years than any Obama-era spending cap increase. Such a dramatic departure from fiscal sanity is reckless.\\nThe now-certain return of trillion-dollar deficits threatens to undermine Republicans’ most significant legislative accomplishment: tax reform.\\nUnlike additional government spending, properly designed tax cuts let people keep more of their own money, allow the economy to grow, and lead to higher wages and better economic opportunities.\\nTax reform’s promise was simple. American families will send an average of 2,000 fewer dollars to Washington each year—a tax cut for America.\\nIncreased omnibus spending telegraphs the opposite message. Taxes won’t stay low for long.\\nFederal government spending is more than 20 percent of the U.S. economy, and spending consistently exceeds what the government collects in tax revenue.\\nThis past year, the House, the Senate, and President Donald Trump all proposed budgets that cut spending growth and move the U.S. toward fiscal sanity. Each of these proposals has been successively ignored.\\nInstead, Congress crafts bipartisan agreements to spend more every year—reviving trillion-dollar deficits and increasing the pace at which the U.S. debt grows.\\nWithout spending cuts, including significant reforms to entitlement spending, tax cuts only serve to make the U.S. fiscal crisis worse. However, a dearth of tax revenue is not the reason Congress has racked up $20 trillion of debt. Washington’s problem is an addiction to spending other people’s money.\\nCongress’ decision to reduce tax revenue and increase spending at the same time is a recipe for fiscal disaster. In fact, Congress’ new spending is projected to increase over the next 10 years by the same amount it just cut taxes, pushing the difference between revenues and spending even further off balance.\\nWhat is often forgotten in the abstract world of budget math is that Washington’s fiscal policy matters to the bottom line of every American. When the IRS takes less of your money, you have more to spend, plow back into your business, or put toward your child’s education or your retirement plan.\\nThe economic benefits of the tax cuts are readily apparent. Unemployment is sustained at a 17-year low, and wages are rising faster than they have since 2009. Indeed, hundreds of businesses have announced raises, bonuses, and new investments directly benefiting millions of Americans.\\nDon’t count on the good times lasting forever. When legislators are unwilling to address out-of-control spending, they quickly look for new sources of revenue.\\nCongress and the president are repeating the mistakes of history. Portions of both the Reagan tax cuts in the early 1980s and the Bush tax cuts in the early 2000s were ultimately reversed.\\nEvery American who just received a tax cut should be a newly minted deficit hawk.

Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies at The Heritage Foundation.\\nSin taxes of all types have unintended consequences.\\nA new\\nproposal in the House Ways and Means Committee to tax electronic\\ncigarettes could harm the health of Americans—and could even be deadly. \\nThe tax will slow the decline in traditional smoking-related\\nhealth complications as fewer adults switch to smokeless alternatives that\\nresearch has demonstrated to be less harmful. \\nThe tax will also stimulate the black market and move\\nthe sale of otherwise legal products outside the reach of law enforcement and\\nhealth officials. \\nThe health risks of traditional tobacco cigarettes are well-known. Cigarette use “is the leading preventable cause of death in the United States,” according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \\nNew products such as e-cigarettes are able to deliver nicotine without the chemicals and tar that are most destructive to the human body. Nicotine alone does not cause cancer. \\xa0\\nE-cigarettes don’t have to be 100% risk-free to be a\\nmajor improvement over inhaling from the end of what I grew up knowing as\\n“death sticks.” \\nIn a comprehensive report, Public Health England\\xa0concluded\\nthat\\xa0e-cigarettes are “95% less harmful than tobacco cigarettes” and “have\\nthe potential to help smokers quit.” \\nNinety-five percent is a lot less death.\\nIf Congress is worried about public health, it should be\\nbroadcasting the potential benefits of vaping, rather than taxing and vilifying\\nthe healthier alternative. \\nAdult smokers are increasingly switching to less harmful\\ne-cigarettes. A new tax would slow this progress. Adult smokers are less likely to make the\\nswitch from traditional cigarettes to e-cigarettes after a new\\nvaping tax is imposed, according to a recent study of new state taxes. \\nThe tax would be in addition to the Food and Drug Administration’s regulatory obstacles, which pose a threat to the continued existence of many vaping businesses.\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSelective excise taxes also empower the tax-evading\\nblack market, which creates other public health costs.\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\nThe sensationalized stories of vaping-related lung injuries and deaths appear to be linked to non-name brand, black market products, many containing THC, the main psychoactive constituent of marijuana. \\nBy levying new taxes that would push more people into\\nthe black market, Congress would increase the likelihood of Americans buying unsafe\\nproducts.\\xa0 \\nAs consumers look for untaxed alternates, new tax-induced\\nblack market demand will encourage large-scale criminal enterprises to increase\\nsupply. \\nThe evidence from traditional cigarette taxes is\\ninstructive. In New York, where the tax rate is the highest\\nin the nation, more than half the cigarette consumption\\nis illegal, making otherwise law-abiding citizens into tax-evading\\ncriminals.\\xa0 \\nHigh sin taxes create black markets, which in turn breed crime and unnecessary conflict. For example, a Virginia man hired a contract killer over a cigarette-smuggling dispute, and the altercation that lead to the death of Eric Garner began over untaxed cigarette sales. \\nSelective excise taxes almost always have unintended consequences. Soda taxes induce many consumers to\\xa0switch to beer or replace soda with other high-calorie options.\\xa0Smokers in high-tax states have been found to smoke cigarettes that are longer and higher in tar and nicotine than smokers in low-tax states. \\nSelective taxes imposed on politically disfavored goods tend\\nto disproportionately hurt the poor. Lower-income consumers spend a larger\\nshare of their incomes on things such as cigarettes and sugary drinks. They are\\nalso more likely to try to evade the tax, increasing their exposure to the\\nhealth and legal risks of the black market. \\nMost fundamentally, sin taxes, especially federal sin taxes, are antithetical to American freedoms. Not only is the government attempting to manipulate your ability to buy otherwise legal goods, it is raising revenue to further expand the already intrusive federal bureaucracy. \\nFor better or worse, state governments are already\\nincreasing taxes on e-cigarettes. A new federal tax will impinge on local\\nauthorities’ ability to make the best decisions for their residents. \\nInstead of\\nattempting to manipulate consumer behavior, Congress should work to levy taxes\\nin the most economically efficient and least market-distorting manner to fund a\\nlimited constitutional government. \\nAll forms of sin taxes are bad public policy. They\\ncreate unintended consequences, rarely address the intended problem, and grow\\nthe size of government. A new federal tax on e-cigarettes would be no\\nexception. ',\n",

Taxes would go up and incomes would go down in\\nevery state, every congressional district, and at every income level. The pain\\nwould be felt all across the country. \\nDepending\\non where you live, the average taxpayer would lose between an estimated $7,660\\nand $59,633 in take-home pay. A family of four could be between $10,585 and\\n$101,009 worse off. \\nThese numbers represent both direct tax increases and slower wage growth from what could easily become a flat-line economy under higher taxes. If you like your higher paycheck, you may not get to keep it.\\xa0 \\xa0\\n>>> How 2 Years of Tax Cuts Have Supported Our Strong Economy\\nAs\\nChristmas approaches, it’s easy to imagine the lost charity and gifts that\\nwould be stolen by a dramatic tax increase.

But the numbers don’t lie. Even The New York Times admits that you (probably) got a tax cut. \\nRepealing the 2017 tax cuts is not just about taxing American employers at highest-in-the-world rates again. It’s also about raising individual income taxes, cutting the child tax credit in half, shrinking the standard deduction, and curbing new investment for U.S. workers.\\nAnd repealing the tax cuts is only part of the left’s tax hike agenda. These figures don’t include the additional losses taxpayers will experience from new and even higher taxes. The left wants to make you pay for misguided and bloated entitlement programs, both old and new.\\nA favorite punching bag of the left is big business. But let’s consider what these businesses do when they can keep a bit more of their profits: They often reinvest it into new equipment, expand factories, and improve technology. \\nThese are the things that lead to higher wages and more job openings for American workers. \\nIn\\nour current economy, we have more\\njob openings than people looking for work and the\\nhighest monthly job\\nopenings since December 2000. And a lot of these open\\npositions are blue-collared\\njobs.\\n\\nUnemployment\\nhas been hovering around 3.5%, which is a 50-year low, and wages are rising\\nfaster than we’ve seen in quite some time, especially for lower-income workers.\\n\\nThis\\neconomy is a boon to lower-earning and middle-class families, enabling more\\nAmericans to experience the meaning and dignity that comes from being able to\\nsupport oneself and one’s community through work. \\xa0\\nIf the tax cuts are repealed, many of these benefits will disappear. Under the pre-tax reform corporate rate, businesses were moving jobs and capital offshore because domestic taxes were uncompetitive, putting American workers at a disadvantage. \\nAmerican\\nworkers are doing well under the tax cuts. But consumers are also doing well.\\nConsumer confidence remains high, retirement accounts continue to grow with the\\nstock market, and inflation remains low—all despite the trade war and runaway\\nfederal spending.\\nRepealing the 2017 tax cuts would mean higher taxes on all Americans, and higher taxes wouldn’t just mean Americans sending more of their paycheck to Washington. It would mean lower wages and more limited job opportunities.  \\nInstead, lawmakers should focus on making critical provisions of the 2017 tax bill permanent to keep taxes low and solidify future economic opportunities.

       " 'The “Medicare for All” plan revealed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., shows how hard it is to raise tens of trillions of dollars without leaving typical Americans economically worse off. Pictured: Warren speaks Oct. 26 in Florence, South Carolina. (Photo: Sean Rayford/Getty Images)\\n\\nAdam Michel\\n/\\n@adamnmichel\\n\\nAdam Michel focuses on tax policy and the federal budget as a policy analyst in the Thomas A. Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies at The Heritage Foundation.\\nNo other country in the world has been\\nable to provide government-managed health care without soaking middle-class and\\nlower-income taxpayers with high income and payroll taxes. \\nThe “Medicare for All” plan revealed\\nby Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., shows how hard it is to raise tens of trillions\\nof dollars without leaving typical Americans economically worse off. \\nDespite the headlines, every single new tax the plan proposes either kneecaps economic opportunity for the American middle class or raises their taxes. \\nHere’s what the plan proposes and some\\nof the well-known problems with each element. \\nNew Payroll Tax: The largest tax increase would be a new $8.8\\ntrillion payroll tax or mandatory premium payment to approximate what employers\\ncurrently pay for health care benefits. \\nAlthough the initial tax is proportional to actual health care spending, over time taxes would equalize to a national average, increasing on employers who have kept health care costs down and rewarding employers who provide more comprehensive benefits. \\nWhen taxes rise on the half of employers below the national average for health care spending, their employees will be worse off, as increasing taxes means slower wage growth.  \\nUnder the plan, big publicly traded businesses with highly paid executives   likely also would pay a higher payroll tax rate to compensate for a temporary preferential rate given to businesses with union contracts. \\nThe size of the business is also important under the plan. The tax is waived for very small employers, but increases with the size of the business—an incentive not to grow the business or add employees. \\nTurning current health care benefits into taxes would create winners and losers at all income levels and businesses sizes. \\nMore IRS Audits: Upping IRS enforcement as a way to raise new\\nrevenue is not as easy as it sounds. Raising trillions of dollars in taxes from\\nAmericans by having more IRS agents auditing families would increase effective\\ntax rates. \\nA significant portion of the\\nuncollected “tax gap” is unreported income by independent contractors, tips in\\nthe service industry, and rental income. By and large, these are middle-class\\ntaxpayers. \\nOften, rosy projections of new revenue\\nfrom more enforcement don’t come to fruition. \\nOne of the plan’s suggestions is to strengthen\\na reporting system for foreign income, which since going into effect likely has\\nnot raised any net revenue. And the cost of\\nimplementing\\nand complying with the law outstripped even the rosiest initial revenue\\nprojections. \\nIf it works, more IRS enforcement will\\nincrease taxes on all Americans. If it does not raise revenue, more enforcement\\nis simply a budget gimmick with high compliance costs. \\nEliminate Expensing: The plan would make it more expensive for\\nbusinesses to invest in American workers. By not allowing companies to deduct\\nthe full cost of new investments from their revenues, the plan would make it so\\nthat businesses pay taxes on profits before the profits are earned. \\nEliminating expensing is also a budget\\ngimmick because it simply makes businesses pay taxes before they should be due,\\naccelerating revenue collection. \\nFor businesses, paying taxes on\\nprofits not yet earned makes many investments too costly. This change would\\nreduce investment, which translates to lower productivity for workers and,\\nultimately, smaller wage gains.\\nHighest-in-the-World Corporate Tax Rate: The plan would raise the federal corporate tax rate back to 35%, the highest rate in the developed world. It also would tax American companies’ worldwide profits, a move that simply would compound the effect of businesses growing and investing less. \\nRaising the corporate tax is a\\nworking-class tax hike. Every fiscal authority around the world believes that workers pay a\\nportion of the corporate tax through lower wages. \\nReasonable estimates show that labor bears more than 75% of the\\nrevenue cost of the corporate tax. \\nA highest-in-the-world corporate tax\\nrate surely would end the current economic expansion, depress new research and\\ndevelopment, and end the current trend of businesses adding new jobs. \\nFinancial Transactions Tax: A new tax on all sales of bonds, stocks, or\\nderivatives is not a new idea. The Congressional Budget Office regularly\\nincludes it in its yearly list of budget options.\\nThe\\xa0CBO’s report\\xa0warns that the tax could “have a number of negative effects on the economy stemming from its effects on asset prices, the cost of capital for firms, and the frequency of trading.” \\nA financial transactions tax would increase rather than decrease\\nmarket volatility; it would hurt digital traders, who benefit the market; and it\\nwouldn’t\\xa0 raise as much revenue as\\nprojected. \\nThe tax also would ultimately be paid\\nby American savers through lower investment returns and fewer economic\\nopportunities.\\xa0 \\nWealth Tax: A\\nnew annual 6% tax on wealth over $1 billion would hurt every American. The tax\\nwould be a fundamental departure from our current tax code, adding an entirely\\nnew and likely unconstitutional tax system on top of the 70,000 pages of\\nexisting tax law. \\nTo some, a 6% tax on billionaires may sound like a small fee to pay, but it’s much more than that. A 6% tax on net wealth earning a 5% return is equivalent to an income tax rate of 120%. That’s in addition to existing and proposed taxes on capital gains, profits, and wage income. \\nA wealth tax eliminates the incentives\\nfor an innovative, dynamic economy. \\nNew Capital Gains Taxes: The proposal calls for changing the way we\\ntax investment income for the highest-income 1% of Americans. \\nThe proposal would require investors\\nto pay higher rates on capital gains before the investment is actually sold. So\\nif the value decreases, the taxes would be levied on phantom profits. \\nCalled mark-to-market taxation, this\\nsystem would be like asking Americans to pay taxes on the estimated increase in\\nthe value of their home, even if they haven’t sold it yet. \\nThe change “would increase the tax\\nburden on savers and increase tax code complexity,” according to the Tax Foundation. \\nThese new taxes are in addition to a multitude of other tax increases Warren has proposed to fund other parts of her agenda. The proposed tax increases would both increase taxes on the middle class and decrease opportunity for all Americans. \\nThe revenue estimates on which the plan is based are the most optimistic projections available and subject to much debate.  The proposal also relies on spending cuts and health care savings that are unlikely to materialize.\\xa0  \\nTaken together, these tax proposals would\\ndramatically shrink the size of the economy and the incentive to work, save,\\nand invest. Smaller, less dynamic economies produce much less tax revenue than\\nthose that are growing. \\nIt is mathematically impossible to pay for large new spending programs with\\nonly tax increases on high-income Americans. Under an expanded government\\nwelfare system, middle-class Americans should expect their taxes to increase\\ndramatically. ',\n",

Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies at The Heritage Foundation.\\nAmerica needs a bold agenda to solidify the current economic expansion and return hard-earned money to taxpayers.\\nThat runs counter to the consensus of those on the left, who want large increases in federal spending and dramatic tax increases to pay for them. Their plans are so expansive that it will require both middle-class payroll tax hikes and broad new taxes on American savers, investors, and employers.\\nOpposing that growth-killing agenda isn’t enough. Conservatives need to draw a stark contrast and push for a second round of tax relief that will let workers keep more of their money, make it easier to save and invest through a universal savings account, and remove the remaining barriers to business investment.\\nLower taxes and reduced red tape have helped fuel a middle-class boom. Wages are growing for Americans at every income level—especially among the lowest-income workers. Jobs are plentiful, unemployment is consistently low, and workers are more satisfied and more secure in their jobs than they have been in decades.\\nBut if Congress and President Donald Trump really want to lock in prosperity, they must pursue both lower taxes and smaller government.\\nUnfortunately, Congress paired the 2017 tax cuts with increased spending. The cuts sparked growth, the spending sparked debt.\\nLast year, economic growth helped increase federal tax collections by 4%, but spending increased by 8%. That’s a problem.\\nTax Reform 2.0 must make the 2017 changes permanent and establish credible, offsetting spending reforms. Each dollar that Washington stops wasting can be plowed into deeper income tax cuts for all taxpaying Americans.\\nThe benefit of tax cuts paired with spending cuts is that the combination is even better for the economy than tax cuts alone. Deficit-financed tax cuts leave a lingering worry that taxes will have to increase again, undermining their potential benefits. As Treasury revenue increases from higher wages and more business activity, those funds can be plowed back into working down the government’s debt and funding subsequent tax cuts.\\nUniversal savings accounts are the conservative alternative to the left’s desire to raise capital gains taxes on American investors. The accounts reduce taxes on savings and help families build financial security through a single, simple, and flexible savings account.\\nThey work like turbocharged retirement savings accounts without the complicated Washington-imposed rules. Ordinary Americans could deposit after-tax income into their savings accounts, and the earnings would grow tax-free.\\nUniversal savings accounts would help lower-income and younger Americans the most. Access to the accounts would allow them to start saving without the complex rules and penalties that currently scare them away from putting money into savings accounts for retirement, health care, and education. Universal savings accounts serve as a sort of on-ramp to retirement savings, something too many Americans delegate to the government to provide.\\nAmerican employers are also in the crosshairs of the tax-and-spend progressive agenda. The left has proposed some of the highest and most complicated business taxes in the world.\\nKeeping business taxes low so that American workers remain competitive and wages can keep rising is a good first step. But conservatives can also champion business expensing, an equally important benefit for U.S. workers that provides the foundation for sustained wage growth and long-term productivity gains.\\nFinishing the 2017 reforms to expensing is the most pro-worker reform Congress could undertake. The reform simply lowers taxes on American businesses’ tangible investments, such as new tools and upgraded machinery.\\nThe last round of reform still excluded the benefit of expensing from certain investments, such as manufacturing floor space and storefronts. Conservatives should champion expensing for all investments to better help American workers compete in a global economy. \\nEconomic opportunity flourishes when the D.C. swamp is receding. Cutting taxes and restraining spending can solidify and expand the gains Americans currently enjoy.\\nOriginally published in The Washington Times.',\n",

Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies at The Heritage Foundation.\\nLast weekend, FedEx became the latest company to face criticism\\xa0from The New York Times for paying little or nothing in income taxes. \\nThe Times’ reporting highlights the complexity of who ultimately bears the corporate tax burden and what that means for American workers. \\nFollowing the Sunday report, Frederick W. Smith, chairman\\nand CEO of FedEx, disputed\\xa0the accuracy of the\\nstory, and highlighted the importance of business investment for economic\\ngrowth and the misleading nature of reporting on isolated annual income tax\\npayments. \\nSmith challenged “A.G. Sulzberger, publisher of the\\nNew York Times, and the business section editor to a public debate in\\nWashington, D.C.,” to discuss “federal tax policy and the relative societal\\nbenefits of business investments and the enormous intended benefits to the\\nUnited States economy, especially lower and middle class wage earners.”\\nWell, let’s have the debate. \\nThe Heritage Foundation invites the Times and FedEx to our headquarters in Washington, D.C., for this discussion on corporate taxes, the effects of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and\\xa0the economic benefits being enjoyed by American workers.\\nIn the spirit of public understanding, we welcome a\\nco-hosting organization, critical of the benefits of the 2017 tax cuts, to join\\nus putting on this event.\\xa0\\nIn the meantime, let’s get back to why The New York Times’ critique of FedEx and the 2017 tax cuts doesn’t add up.\\nThe Times uses FedEx as an example to support its claim that the tax cuts amounted primarily to a “windfall” for large corporations and investors. It claimed FedEx paid no taxes in 2018 and highlighted recently slow economy-wide investment trends following the 2017 tax cuts. \\nIt’s misleading to look at just one year of business taxes paid, particularly one immediately following the tax cuts, and despite the claims, investment increased significantly following the reforms, although trade uncertainly has dragged it back down. \\nBut the Times also missed the larger point—economic research overwhelmingly shows that a majority of the corporate tax is paid by workers through lower wages. So when the corporate tax goes down, wages go up. \\nWhen the economy is humming, as it is today, it is lower-income\\nand middle-class Americans who benefit the most from rising wages, low\\nunemployment, and plentiful job opportunities. Pro-growth policies that support\\na healthy economy benefit workers the most. \\xa0\\xa0\\nThe Times’ narrative is misleading if readers don’t\\nfully understand how corporate taxes are calculated and why. \\nOur business tax system intentionally taxes profits as\\nto not discourage firms from hiring new workers or making new investments.\\nTaxing profits means the system allows firms to deduct costs, such as wages,\\ninvestments, rent, etc., from their revenues. \\nWhen a firm expands by hiring new employees, buying new delivery trucks, or growing warehouse capacity, paying no income tax in that year, as FedEx supposedly did, it shows the system working as planned. Businesses see future opportunities and reinvest would-be taxable profits back into their operations and workers. \\nUntil tax reform, the tax code prohibited businesses from deducting the full cost of a new piece of equipment. Instead, they could only write off a fraction of the cost, spread out over a period of time set by the IRS. \\nThe 2017 tax cuts allowed more investments to be fully “expensed,” which enabled businesses to immediately write off the full cost. \\nHistorically, this type of reform leads businesses to increase new investments as the after-tax cost of buying that next truck or computer decreases. The result of the increased investment is a decrease in taxable profits in the immediate term.\\nEconomists expected economy-wide investment to increase following new expensing rules and a lower corporate tax rate, and that’s exactly what happened. \\nImmediately following the reforms, business fixed investment, new business applications, and other indicators, such as business confidence, all surpassed expectations, although increasing trade uncertainty and new tariffs in the following year dragged investment back down below pre-tax reform projections. \\nIt is thus reasonable to conclude the economic costs\\nof the trade war could have been much worse without the offsetting domestic tax\\ncuts.\\nThe tax cuts and reforms also were not intended to be a one-time or immediate stimulus. Expensing and lower tax rates are structural reforms, designed to increase investment across the U.S. economy, drive productivity gains, and increase wages over the long run. \\nIn such a turbulent policy environment, assessing the\\nsuccess of tax reform will take time as new investment and increased\\nproductivity do not happen instantaneously. \\nThe Times’ story, and Smith’s reaction, highlight the need for a more thorough understanding of how to honestly evaluate business taxes and their impact on American workers. We welcome the opportunity to continue to shed light on this topic by facilitating further discussions.',\n",
       " 'Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D.-N.Y., briefs members of the media outside the West Wing of the White House on Oct. 16. (Photo: Alex Wong/Getty Images)\\n\\nAdam Michel\\n/\\n@adamnmichel\\n\\nAdam Michel focuses on tax policy and the federal budget as a policy analyst in the Thomas A. Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies at The Heritage Foundation.\\nSenate Democrats are trying to chip away at critical\\nelements of the 2017 tax cuts.\\nIncluded in the 2017 tax cuts is the new $10,000 cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, one of the reform’s signature achievements. The cap advanced the bipartisan goal of treating taxpayers across the income scale more fairly by diminishing the previously unlimited subsidy for high-income taxpayers in high-tax states.\\nThe Senate is set to vote to overturn regulations that are\\nnecessary to implement the cap according to congressional intent. Overturning\\nthe regulations could increase the deficit by more $673 billion over\\n10 years and encourage high-income taxpayers to avoid taxes and make a profit\\nin the process. \\nThe SALT cap was part of the most sweeping update to the\\nU.S. tax code in more than 30 years, which cut taxes and has allowed the American\\neconomy to continue its longest\\neconomic expansion in recorded history. Undermining the SALT cap would\\nbegin to chip away at the core achievements of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs\\nAct.\\xa0 \\nSenators may be motivated by two misconceptions\\nabout the SALT deduction and the implementing regulations. \\nMyth No. 1: The Cap Hurts Middle-Class Taxpayers\\nBefore the 2017 tax cut capped the SALT deduction, 70% of taxpayers received no benefit from it. Most of the benefits flowed to wealthy taxpayers in high-tax states.\\nDespite the SALT cap, the vast majority of taxpayers still\\ngot a big tax cut for three reasons.\\nFirst, the tax law doubled the standard deduction, which\\nmeans that about half of the people who previously chose to itemize their taxes\\n(which allows access to the SALT write-off) now voluntarily choose to take the\\nnew larger standard deduction. Most of these people are better off than they\\nwere before.\\nSecond, tax rates were lowered across the board. Even if\\ntaxable income increased slightly because of the SALT cap, lower tax rates mean\\nmost people still came out ahead.\\nThird, because the tax law raised the exemption for the ineffective and overly complicated alternative minimum tax (AMT), millions of higher-income AMT-paying taxpayers saw the SALT deduction increase from zero to $10,000 under the new law because they no longer have to pay the AMT. Taxpayers subject to the AMT are not allowed to take the SALT deduction.\\nIf repealing the regulations make the SALT cap unenforceable, it could reduce revenues by $673 billion over 10 years and would primarily benefit wealthy taxpayers at the expense of other taxpayers. \\nIt would further generate larger deficits and a faster-growing national debt, slowing economic growth, which will hurt lower-income earners through reduced opportunity the most.\\nMyth No. 2: The Regulations Hurt State-Based Tax Credit Organizations \\nTo implement the SALT cap as intended by Congress, the\\nTreasury Department wrote regulations to disallow the use of new state tax\\ncredit schemes set up to game the charitable deduction and circumvent the SALT\\ncap. \\nThese new programs would allow savvy taxpayers to artificially\\nrecharacterize their state taxes as charitable donations, which are not subject\\nto the $10,000 cap.\\xa0\\xa0 \\nExisting legitimate state-based tax credit-supported charities for education choice, environmental protection, and research got unintentionally caught up in the first round of regulations. \\nThese organizations can offer a state-provided offsetting\\ntax credit for donations, in effect allowing taxpayers to direct their money to\\nprivate charity rather than the government alternatives. \\nThe glitch in the proposed regulations limited the ability to donate for about 10% of taxpayers—those who chose to itemize but didn’t max out their SALT deduction. \\nIn the final regulations, Treasury fixed the problem they\\ncaused and reestablished the federal tax system’s neutrality toward state tax\\ncredit programs. Donors who receive an offsetting state tax credit for\\ncontributions to charitable organizations are not subject to new regulatory\\nlimits on the federal SALT deduction, up to the cap of $10,000. \\nThe regulations also ended the ability for some taxpayers to\\nactually come out ahead or in one sense “make\\nmoney” when they donated to tax credit\\norganizations. This was a very limited problem before 2017, but the new SALT\\ncap without the appropriate implementing regulations made the problem much\\nworse.\\nBy receiving a 100% tax credit for state taxes paid and a federal charitable deduction, a taxpayer could potentially donate $1,000 and receive $1,370 in federal and state tax savings. The current regulations prohibit the unintentional $370 of such federal tax planning strategies.\\nWhether the charity is legitimate or not, the tax code\\nshould not allow someone to make a profit by donating to a charity.\\nRepealing the regulations would not only give wealthy\\nAmericans a large and unfair subsidy for their state taxes, but the move would\\ncut their taxes by even more than the pre-2017 law.

Sens.\\nCharles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Ron Wyden, D-Ore., accurately described the tax as\\n“unreasonable, protectionist, and discriminatory.” \\nThe Treasury Department investigated this tax under Section\\n301 of the Trade Act of 1974 and found\\nthat the digital services tax “is inconsistent with prevailing principles of\\ninternational tax policy, and is unusually burdensome for affected U.S.\\ncompanies.” These findings permit the president to respond with reciprocal tariffs.\\nBut the president should not use this authority. \\nLike tariffs, the cost of the French tax falls almost\\nentirely on French domestic businesses and consumers. Amazon already has begun\\nto pass\\nthe cost on to third-party French sellers. A similar Australian\\ntax on digital downloads from overseas resulted in higher prices—in some\\ncases, the price increase was more than the value of the tax. \\nOnly 5 percent of the French digital services tax will be\\npaid by the targeted large internet companies, according to a recent\\nstudy from Deloitte. More than half will be paid by French consumers\\ndirectly, and 40 percent will be paid by local French businesses that use the\\ntaxed digital platforms. \\nThis tax in France and other similar proposals serve two\\ngoals. \\nIt leverages populist anti-U.S., anti-big business sentiment\\nto levy higher domestic taxes on foreign firms. \\nAnd it enables European countries to use the threat of these\\nnew taxes on U.S. firms to coerce the U.S. to be part of the ongoing Organisation\\nfor Economic Cooperation and Development work program to rewrite the international corporate income tax\\nrules. \\nBig-spending, cash-strapped European governments are hungry to\\nexpand their tax bases through the OECD project. This threatens to undermine\\nlongstanding international tax principles that keep taxes low and\\nfacilitate global trade by linking physical business location to taxing power.\\nIf the French succeed at bullying the rest of the world into\\nthese new rules, they will further destabilize\\nthe international tax system and lead to higher taxes on American and other\\ninternational businesses, hurting workers and consumers. \\nThe U.S. should refuse to participate in this process to\\nabandon the physical-presence requirement for business taxation. Congress\\nshould reject any such plan.\\xa0 \\nBoth the French tax and the threatened U.S. tariffs harm\\nbusinesses and consumers. The president may be legally permitted to levy\\nretaliatory tariffs—but American consumers would be harmed in the process. \\nIf France wants to place new taxes on its own citizens, so\\nbe it. America can use our position to explain why such a move is terrible\\npolicy and hurts the French people. But let’s not punish American consumers for\\nthe policy blunders of the French government.\\nTori Smith and Joel Griffith contributed to this op-ed.',\n",
       " '\"Despite claims to the contrary, every income group benefited from the tax cut,\" writes Adam Michel. (Photo: Zero Creatives/Getty Images)\\n\\nAdam Michel\\n/\\n@adamnmichel\\n\\nAdam Michel focuses on tax policy and the federal budget as a policy analyst in the Thomas A. Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies at The Heritage Foundation.\\nThis month marks the two-year anniversary of the Tax\\nCuts and Jobs Act, the most sweeping update to the U.S. tax code in more than\\n30 years. \\nThe reforms simplified the process of paying taxes,\\nlowered rates on individuals and businesses, and updated the business tax code\\nso that American corporations and the people they employ can be globally\\ncompetitive again.\\nThe tax cuts included a long list of reforms that are\\nworth reviewing. \\xa0\\nFor individuals, the tax cuts reduced federal income tax rates, increased the standard deduction, doubled the child tax credit, repealed the personal and dependent exemptions, and capped the deductions for state and local taxes, among many other reforms. These expire at the end of 2025. \\nFor businesses, the law permanently lowered the\\ncorporate tax rate to 21%, down from a global high of 35%, and temporarily\\nallowed businesses to fully deduct most new U.S. investments. \\nThe tax bill cut taxes for the vast majority of Americans—9 out of every 10 people saw a tax cut or no change in what they paid. \\nUsing IRS data, The Heritage Foundation found that average households in every congressional district were projected to benefit from a tax cut in 2018. Most Americans received their tax cut through lower employer withholding and thus bigger paychecks. \\nThe average American was projected to get a $1,400 tax\\ncut in 2018 and $2,900 for a family of four.\\nWe don’t have to guess anymore about the effects of\\nthe tax cuts. After actually filing their taxes with the\\nIRS,\\nAmericans saw their average effective tax rates decline by 13% (or about 1.5\\npercentage points). Despite claims to the contrary, every income group\\nbenefited from the tax cut. \\nThere were also significant time-savings and simplification. Not every part of the tax code was streamlined, but for most individual taxpayers, taxpaying is now more straightforward. \\nIn 2017, 30% of households itemized their taxes, a\\nmore complicated process of documenting and calculating a list of discrete\\nwrite-offs, such as the mortgage interest and charitable deductions. \\nIn the first year of the tax cut, itemizers dropped from\\n30% to 10%, showing that millions of Americans opted for the single, simpler\\nstandard deduction. Under the new system the number of people who were able to\\ndo their own taxes increased\\nby 4.4%.\\xa0 \\nAmerican workers and businesses have been doing better\\nalmost every year since the Great Recession. But the past several years have\\nbeen different. Things aren’t just a bit better—we’ve been setting records. \\nUnemployment is at a 50-year low of 3.5%. Businesses\\nhave added jobs for 110 straight months, the longest streak on record, and\\nthere are more jobs available than people looking for them. \\nWages have also been increasing. Average wage growth over\\nthe past year was 3.1% in the most recent government data. Non-supervisory and\\nproduction worker wages grew even faster, at 3.7%. Before 2018, wage growth\\nhadn’t reached 3% since 2009. \\nThe lowest wage earners in the U.S. have been experiencing\\nsome of the largest wage gains. The 10th percentile wage earner (people making\\nabout $12 an hour) have benefited from a 7% wage increase from the third\\nquarter of 2018 through the same in 2019, in the most recent quarterly\\ndata.\\nThat’s more than twice the gain in average wages and roughly equivalent to a\\n$1,500 raise for someone earning less than $25,000 a year.\\nMinorities are also seeing larger than average gains.\\nLower-wage black workers have seen wage growth of 8.5%, and similar low-wage\\nblack women workers saw gains larger than 10%. Similar trends can be seen for\\nlow-wage Asian workers, Hispanic women, and people without a high school\\ndegree.\\xa0 \\xa0\\nBetween the tax cuts and wage gains, The Heritage\\nFoundation calculated that over the decade following the tax\\ncuts, the typical American household will reap an additional $26,000 in\\ntake-home pay or $45,000 for a family of four. That’s more than enough to buy a\\nnew car or put a down payment on a house. \\nThe American people seem to be internalizing all the\\ngood news. Job satisfaction\\nand consumer confidence are high. Thanks to the strong economy, Americans who\\naren’t happy at their current work are voluntarily leaving their jobs for\\nbetter opportunities at close to record rates.\\nAnd Americans are saving more too, using the good economic times to prepare for\\ntheir future.\\xa0 \\nThe main way the tax cuts are expected to contribute\\nto furthering the good economic trends is through increased business\\ninvestment, which leads to more jobs, better technology, and eventually\\nproductivity gains. Each of these things helps boost wages. \\nHistorically, reforms that lower business tax rates\\nand allow more investment\\nwrite-offs lead to increased business activity. Thus, economists\\nexpected economy-wide investment to increase following the reforms, and that’s\\nexactly what happened. \\nIt wasn’t until uncertainty regarding trade and tariffs\\nin the following year dragged investment back down below pre-tax reform\\nprojections. The trade war seems to be hiding the tremendous successes of the\\n2017 tax cuts. \\nImmediately following the reforms, business fixed\\ninvestment, new business applications, and other indicators, such as business\\nconfidence, all\\xa0surpassed\\xa0expectations.\\nFor example, immediately after the tax cuts were signed into law, business\\ninvestment increase by 39%\\namong the 130 in the S&P 500. \\nIn such a turbulent policy environment, assessing the\\nlong-term success of tax reform will take time as new investment and increased\\nproductivity do not happen instantaneously. \\nThe challenge for lawmakers will be to keep taxes low\\nin the coming years so that the full economic benefits of the 2017 tax cuts can\\nbe enjoyed by generations to come.\\xa0 ',\n",

Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies at The Heritage Foundation.\\n\\nTravis Nix\\n/\\n@tnix113\\n\\nTravis Nix is a student at Villanova University and an alumnus of The Heritage Foundation\\'s Young Leaders Program.\\nBefore lawmakers left for August recess, the Democrat-controlled\\nHouse voted\\nto raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. \\nSuch a move would backfire in a major way if passed into law. It would hurt lower-skilled individuals the most, including teenagers, immigrants, and those without a high school degree. And women, who hold more low-wage jobs than men, would be hurt the most, accounting for more than 60% of the resulting lay-offs.\\nThe push for new wage mandates comes at a puzzling\\ntime: We are in the midst of a record economic expansion in which workers in\\nlower-wage jobs are seeing their wages grow faster than many high-wage workers.\\n\\nThis is no mere blip on the screen. It’s an ongoing\\ntrend, as the July\\njobs report shows.\\n\\nAverage wage growth has been above 3% for the last 11\\nstraight months. Meanwhile, the lowest 10th percentile of wage earners ( people\\nmaking about $12 an hour) have benefited from more than twice that gain in\\nwages—a 6.6% wage increase over just the last year. That’s equivalent to a\\nroughly $1,500 raise for someone earning less than $25,000 a year.\\nSome are now claiming that minimum wage increases at the state level are responsible. One short study, which was repeated in the pages of The Washington Post, shows that states with minimum wage hikes since 2013 have seen faster wage growth for low-wage workers. \\nNot so fast. There are some serious problems with this\\nstudy. \\nFor one, many states that increased their minimum wage also instituted pro-growth reforms during the same time. New York, for example, improved its business climate in 2014 by cutting its corporate tax to its lowest rate since the 1960s. Missouri; Arizona; Washington, D.C.; Minnesota; and Maine are all among the states that cut taxes during this time period while also raising their minimum wage.\\nThere is now ample\\nevidence that pro-growth policies, like business tax cuts, fuel\\nwage growth and new hiring. Research on the minimum wage tells the opposite\\nstory: one of job loss and wage stagnation. \\nThe economic fact is that when the government forces businesses to pay an employee a mandated hourly wage, businesses are left with few options: Cut hours, lay off workers, or reduce benefits—or some combination of these. \\nMost often, businesses are forced to cut jobs, which is why the Congressional Budget Office found that raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour could lead to over 3.7 million workers losing their jobs. \\nA 2011 study\\nfrom The Heritage Foundation painted an even bleaker picture, finding that this\\npolicy would force 7 million Americans out of work. \\xa0\\nEconomists have\\ndocumented the significant negative impact of Seattle’s decision to raise the minimum wage to\\n$13 an hour. That decision resulted in a drop in employment across the city.\\nWorkers who retained their jobs ended up working fewer hours, resulting in a net\\nincome loss. \\nA similar trend\\nresulted from Illinois’ 2002 minimum wage hike.\\nIf history is any guide, minimum wage increases lead to slower rather than faster wage growth. \\nA 2015 study found that workers in states with small increases in the minimum wage from 2005-2008 ended up with lower wages than they would have had if the state never increased its minimum wage. The minimum wage hike achieved the exact opposite of its goal. \\nThis happens, in part, because minimum wages shrink\\nthe number of jobs available, meaning there are equally qualified workers competing\\nfor fewer jobs. Workers who are lucky enough to retain their job see slower\\nwage growth than they would have otherwise because the job market is full of\\npeople who can easily replace them. \\nMinimum wages also have been\\nshown to incentivize\\nlow-income youth to drop out of school, which lowers their future earnings. And,\\nthey cut off employment opportunities entirely for workers who cannot yet\\nproduce the minimum wage. \\nAt $15 per hour, workers\\nmust be able to produce upward of $35,000 per year. That’s a high bar for\\nanyone just starting out and especially high for teenagers trying to get their\\nfirst job, perhaps to save for college. \\nA study on the long-run\\neffects of minimum wages found that the longer individuals were exposed to\\nhigher minimum wages at young ages, the less they worked and earned by their\\nlate 20s. The study also noted that “the adverse longer-run effects are\\nstronger for blacks.”\\nIt may be true that some minimum wage hikes raise wages\\nfor a few lucky workers, but it comes at the expense of layoffs and shorter\\nhours for others.\\nWorkers have much more to\\ngain from sustainable wage increases, and so do employers and customers, since\\nboth groups want better performance from workers.\\nOur economy is currently booming, and a key feature of\\nthat is the strong job market. There are now over a million\\nmore jobs available than people looking for work. Employers are\\noffering wage\\nincreases, bonuses,\\nnew training opportunities, and better\\nbenefits to retain and upskill their best employees. \\nEmployers are competing for labor. That puts workers\\nin the driver’s seat, allowing them to demand higher wages and better benefits.\\nMoreover, productivity is a major leverage point for workers. When workers are more productive, they bring more value to the company and can therefore demand higher wages. \\nThe current economic environment has benefited from two\\nthings: the 2017 tax cuts and ongoing deregulation. These policies are making\\nAmerican workers more productive.\\nThe 2017 tax cuts significantly lowered the cost of new\\ninvestment by cutting the corporate tax rate and allowing companies to write\\noff the full cost of many new investments from their taxes. Now, companies have\\na greater incentive to re-invest their profits into the tools and research\\nworkers need to be more productive employees. \\nAnd, as workers become more valuable through increased\\nproductivity, they are empowered to demand higher wages. \\nBut these tax cuts need to be made permanent to ensure workers continue to experience benefits they currently enjoy. \\nThe United States’ record-long economic expansion has\\nhelped lower-income workers the most, and the whole gamut of pro-growth\\npolicies have helped prolong the current expansion. These gains are impressive\\ndespite the economic uncertainty exacted by President Donald Trump’s tariff\\npolicy and our ever-expanding federal debt, which must\\nbe addressed. \\nCongress should not tempt the resilience of the\\nAmerican economy by mandating a higher federal minimum wage. Lower-wage workers\\nare feeling a boon like no other in recent memory. The last thing we should do\\nis bring it to a premature end. ',\n",
       " 'According to the best estimates, the highest-income Americans already send about half of their earnings to the government.  (Photo: Getty Images)\\n\\nAdam Michel\\n/\\n@adamnmichel\\n\\nAdam Michel focuses on tax policy and the federal budget as a policy analyst in the Thomas A. Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies at The Heritage Foundation.\\nBy almost every\\nmeasure, the U.S. has one of the most progressive systems of taxation in the\\nworld, in which high-income people pay the highest tax rates.\\nEveryone agrees on this basic fact, except The New York Times. \\nUsing data from a new book by Berkeley economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, the Times claims that the tax rate on the highest-income Americans was 23% in 2018, falling below the tax rates of all other income groups. \\nTo get this result, they had to cook the books, systematically inflating the income of the richest Americans (without also increasing taxes) and leaving out important transfer programs for poor Americans, such as the earned income tax credit, which can more than offset the cost of the payroll tax for some with low incomes. \\nThe tax code in\\nAmerica is exceedingly complex, and there is certainly no consensus on the one\\nbest way to measure progressivity or average tax rates. But when you look at\\nall estimates—from the government, international organizations, left-leaning\\nthink tanks—you can only conclude that the rich do indeed pay more in taxes\\nthan lower-income Americans. In fact, they pay much more. \\nThe most recent IRS data, from 2016, shows that the top 10% of income earners pay almost 70% of federal income taxes. However, after the estate tax, the federal income tax is the most progressive part of the U.S. tax code. \\nAmericans also\\npay less progressive payroll taxes, corporate taxes, excise taxes, and at the\\nstate level, property and sales taxes. \\nLooking at all federal taxes, the Congressional Budget Office shows that the top 1% pay an average federal tax rate of 33.3%. The data shows tax rates decline with income, and the poorest 20% of the population pays an average tax rate of just 1.7%. \\nThe left-leaning Tax Policy Center shows similar results. \\nJust looking at\\nall federal taxes ignores the effect of state taxes, which tend to be less\\nprogressive, but make up a smaller share of total taxes paid. \\nThe liberal Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy estimates that combined federal, state, and local taxes are still quite progressive. It finds the top 1% pay a 33.7% tax rate. The poorest 20% of Americans pay an average 20.2% cumulative tax rate. \\nThe data also show the highest-income taxpayers is the only group that pays a larger share of total taxes than its share of total income. \\nWhile not available\\nfor as many income groups, data from the international Organization for Economic Cooperation\\nand Development show\\na similarly progressive combined federal, state, and local tax code.\\xa0\\xa0 \\nThe novelty of the Saez-Zucman data is their focus on the households in the top 0.01% and the top 0.0003% (top 400 highest incomes). It is these households, they claim, that have seen the biggest tax cuts over the years. \\nUsing data\\ncompiled for the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, David Splinter corrects several errors in the Saez-Zucman data.\\n\\nThe adjusted data show the top 0.01% will pay an average federal, state, and local tax rate of 50%, 20 points higher than the Saez-Zucman equivalent estimate. Splinter shows that the bottom income group’s true tax rate is closer to 13 percent, compared with Saez-Zucman’s 20%.\\nTwo of the main assumptions that drive the Saez-Zucman results are a systematic overestimate of unreported (and thus untaxed) income for high-income households and their decision to leave out important subsidy programs that offset taxes paid by people with lower incomes. \\nAverage tax rates\\nare estimated by dividing taxes paid by income. Because not all income is\\nreported to the IRS, official income measures have to be adjusted up, resulting\\nin a lower effective tax rate. \\nThose who work in\\nrestaurants, for example, might not report all their tip income to the\\ngovernment, and landlords often don’t fully disclose their rents. \\nSaez and Zucman assume that households underreport income in proportion to their reported income. IRS audits of actual taxpayers show the opposite. \\nThe ratio of underreported-to-reported income decreases for higher levels of income. The ratios also change over time. For example, around the time of the 1986 income tax cuts, reported income increased significantly because lower rates increase tax compliance. \\nMisallocating\\nuntaxed income makes top earners’ incomes systematically larger than they\\nactually are, artificially driving down the estimated tax rate. \\nFor low-income taxpayers, Saez and Zucman leave out refundable tax credits and other means-tested benefit programs that help to offset the cost of payroll, sales, and excise taxes. Specifically, the “refundable” portion of the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit—which are outlays like other welfare spending—can offset almost all of the federal payroll tax for many of the lowest-income workers, especially those with children. \\nSince 1990, refundable federal tax credit rates have increased more than 400% for the lowest 20% of households, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Other means-tested transfer programs, such as Medicaid, have also increased substantially over time. \\nResearchers can reasonably debate which of these tax and non-tax programs to include when investigating the progressivity of the tax system, but simply including the programs explicitly administered through the tax code flips The New York Times’ narrative upside down. \\nThere’s a broad\\nconsensus across the ideological spectrum that the U.S. has a highly progressive\\ntax system. \\nDemocrats can\\nstill argue for higher taxes on the wealthy, but we need to acknowledge that\\naccording to the best estimates, the highest-income Americans already send about\\nhalf of their earnings to the government.

       " 'Sometimes, it feels like we live in Bizarro World,\\nwhere everything is the opposite of what we would expect. \\nConsider, for example, the regulation of e-cigarettes\\nand other alternatives to traditional cigarettes. Those who advocate policies\\nthat would help maintain existing levels of cigarette smoking are somehow\\nviewed as the “righteous.”\\xa0\\xa0 \\nThe Tobacco Control Act, which gave the Food and Drug Administration the power to regulate tobacco products, is creating major obstacles for the sale of e-cigarettes and other alternative products, thereby doing more to block cigarette smokers from quitting than allowing them to stop.\\xa0   This all needs to change.  One of the leading tobacco researchers, the late Michael Russell, famously said, “People smoke for nicotine but they die from the tar.”  It’s the burning of tobacco that releases thousands of harmful chemicals. New products like e-cigarettes reflect this understanding, delivering nicotine without burning tobacco. \\nThat doesn’t necessarily mean they are safe, but the\\nresearch shows that they are less harmful than combustible cigarettes.\\xa0 \\nIn the most comprehensive government\\nreport\\xa0of its kind, Public Health England described\\ne-cigarettes in 2015 as “95% less harmful that tobacco cigarettes.”\\n\\xa0\\xa0The FDA also recognizes\\nthat these new products are less harmful than combustible cigarettes.\\n Yet, the FDA, through its implementation of the Tobacco Control Act, has issued regulations that will effectively put an end to many alternative products that are currently available to smokers.\\xa0 Specifically, the FDA is requiring these products to go through the costly and burdensome pre-market tobacco-application process. That’s a barrier that, once enforced, will jeopardize the continued existence of many of these products.  Ironically, some e-cigarette opponents irrationally justify their dislike for the products based on a dislike of big tobacco companies.\\xa0 Yet, the big tobacco companies and other big businesses are the ones that will be able to afford the costly approval process, while the many small businesses in the field will likely cease to exist.  The entire narrative and policy debate around e-cigarettes ignores the critical benefits of these products.\\xa0 Instead of shouting from the mountaintops that private innovations are now available that can help reduce cigarette smoking, the FDA is using concern over youth usage of e-cigarettes as a way to demonize the products. \\nTo be clear, the FDA should be concerned\\nabout youth usage of nicotine delivery products; nicotine is addictive and the\\nsafety of these new products still needs to be monitored.\\xa0 The FDA, however, shouldn’t be using this\\nconcern as a reason to promote policies that would help maintain current levels\\nof smoking or prevent Americans from having access to products that could save\\ntheir lives. Nor should they be diverting attention from the critical\\nimportance of these alternative products.\\n\\nUnderlying this entire narrative is an unfortunate and arguably dangerous\\nconflating of two very different issues: the harmful and cancer-causing effects\\nof smoking cigarettes and the harmful effects of nicotine.\\xa0 Smokers get cancer from the combustion of cigarettes, not the nicotine.\\xa0 \\nIn fact, data show that about half of American adults incorrectly think nicotine is the main substance in cigarettes that causes\\ncancer.\\xa0 Further, American adults increasingly think that using e-cigarettes is as harmful or more harmful than\\nsmoking cigarettes (as high as two-thirds\\nof adults).\\n\\nThis is a true crisis, arguably caused in large part by government\\nmessaging.\\xa0 If cigarette smokers don’t\\neven know that e-cigarettes are less harmful than cigarettes, then they don’t\\nhave much reason to switch.\\xa0 \\nSo what should Congress do?\\nLegislators should take immediate action\\nto eliminate looming regulations that would effectively block the sale of many e-cigarette and\\nalternative products.\\xa0 They should also\\ncarefully review how federal agencies are contributing to the misinformation that\\nexists regarding these products, and take steps to address this problem.\\xa0 \\nIn addition, Congress should ensure that the FDA reasonably addresses legitimate concerns regarding youth usage of e-cigarettes, without undermining adult access to these products.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of death in the United States.”\\xa0 E-cigarettes and other alternative products can help change this.\\xa0 That’s something Congress shouldn’t forget.

       " 'Last week saw a major victory for property rights and an end to another Endangered Species Act horror story. \\nThe saga began in 2012 when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service determined that 1,544 acres of land in Louisiana was “critical habitat” for an endangered species known as the dusky gopher frog.\\xa0 \\nAs a result of this designation, the federal\\ngovernment was considering a ban on the development of the property, depriving\\nthe private property owners of $33.9\\nmillion.\\nThe federal government continued to pursue this action even though the dusky gopher frog has not been seen in Louisiana in over 50 years. \\nThe frog couldn’t even survive on the property. The only way the area could support the frog is if the private property owners make major and costly changes to the property—changes they have said they have no inclination to make nor can they be forced to make.\\nAs the Pacific Legal Foundation’s Mark\\nMiller, who represented the property owners, recently stated, “The feds may as well have labeled this Louisiana property\\ncritical habitat for a polar bear. It would have done just as much good.”\\n\\nUnfortunately, in 2016, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held that the government’s actions were permissible. The implications of allowing such an area to be designated “critical habitat” would be sweeping. Judge Priscilla Owen in her dissent argued:\\nIf the Endangered Species Act permitted the actions taken by the government in this case, then vast portions of the United States could be designated as ‘critical habitat’ because it is theoretically possible, even if not probable, that land could be modified to sustain the introduction or reintroduction of an endangered species.\\nIn a unanimous 2018 decision (Justice Brett Kavanaugh did not participate), the Supreme Court rejected the 5th Circuit’s opinion, but didn’t actually answer the question about whether the area was “critical habitat.” Instead, it sent the case back to the 5th Circuit for its review, consistent with the Supreme Court’s opinion.\\nThis included ensuring that the area is “habitat” for the dusky gopher frog before getting into whether it is “critical habitat,” and reviewing whether the federal government’s failure to exclude the area as “critical habitat” was permissible. The Supreme Court held that such exclusions are subject to judicial review.\\nFor the property owners in Louisiana, though, the issue was still very much alive.\\xa0 \\nBut last week, maybe because the “writing was on the wall,” the Fish and Wildlife Service and the property owners settled the case, with the federal government dropping its efforts to designate the land as critical habitat for the dusky gopher frog.\\nThis entire saga provides yet another example of how the Endangered Species Act and its implementation fail to conserve species while simultaneously hurting property owners.\\nThe federal government wasted resources and attention to achieve an outcome that never would have helped the dusky gopher frog because the habitat wasn’t suitable for its survival. This entire misguided attack on property rights certainly appears more about restricting development than conserving the dusky gopher frog.\\nAfter 45 years, it shouldn’t be surprising that lessons have been learned regarding how to modernize and improve the Endangered Species Act and its implementation. Those lessons should be applied, not rejected, in order to save every word of a flawed statute and every misguided interpretation of the law.\\nThis dusky gopher frog saga should serve as one of these important lessons.

       " 'Last July, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that it was going to provide $12 billion in aid to help farmers with the “trade damage” from numerous trade disputes.\\nThat was supposed to be a one-time relief package, but there was little reason at that time to think it would stop with the $12 billion.\\nSure enough, less than a year later, the USDA is reportedly going to offer another aid package for farmers that could cost as much as $20 billion.\\nLike before, this special aid package for farmers is misguided. Here are just three reasons why the USDA shouldn’t move forward with this plan:\\n1. Compounding one mistake with another. \\nThe federal government is trying to solve one harmful policy (increasing the tariff rate to 25% on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports that were previously subjected to a 10% tariff, and potentially imposing additional tariffs on $300 billion worth of Chinese goods) with another harmful policy (the aid).\\xa0 \\nThese tariffs drive up prices for Americans. In fact, the very purpose of tariffs is to make imports more expensive. The additional costs on Chinese imports are largely paid by American importers who then can pass those costs on to consumers.\\nAnother major problem is trade retaliation. In response to U.S. tariffs imposed last year, China retaliated with its own tariffs. The Congressional Research Service explained that China “has levied retaliatory tariffs on about 800 U.S. food and agricultural products that were worth about $20.6 billion in exports to that country in 2017.”\\nNow there’s the increased U.S. tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports. In response, China announced that it will impose higher tariffs on $60 billion in American goods, including American food and agricultural products. \\nThe\\nspecial aid for farmers only makes matters worse. Taxpayers are now going to be\\nrequired to pay as much as $20 billion more to help farmers offset the damage\\nfrom the self-inflicted harm caused by tariffs.\\nThese special farm aid “solutions” can lead to a terrible precedent; namely, creating a justification for maintaining and even expanding tariffs, instead of opening up trade opportunities.\\xa0 \\nIn fact, that appears to be happening now.\\n2. Inappropriately picking winners and losers. \\nFarmers certainly are not winners in these trade disputes, including the trade dispute with China. However, they would be getting favorable treatment over other interests and individuals. \\nThese trade disputes are hurting far more people than farmers. For example:\\nIn addition to the inappropriate favoritism, this assistance to farmers creates a slippery slope. There is no logical stopping point as to who should receive special aid.\\n3. Duplicative payments. \\nThese special aid packages for farmers seem to ignore the fact that the payments are generally duplicative in nature.

       " 'The Trump administration last month repealed\\nthe Obama administration’s infamous “waters of the United States” rule, by which bureaucrats tried to use the Clean Water Act\\nto regulate almost every water imaginable.\\nBut this repeal was just the first\\nstep in efforts by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corps of\\nEngineers to develop a new definition of “waters of the United States,” referred\\nto as WOTUS, that is consistent with the rule of law. This definition would clarify\\nwhat waters may be regulated under the Clean Water Act.\\nThe second step, and the major one, is\\nexpected to take place within the next couple of months: The EPA and Corps will\\nissue a final rule that includes their new definition.\\xa0 \\nThe importance of this new rule can’t be overstated. For decades, the EPA and Corps struggled to develop a definition for “waters of the United States” because they consistently sought to expand their power without regard for what the Clean Water Act actually authorizes. \\xa0\\nThis overreach directly affects Americans, from farmers plowing land and families seeking to build their dream homes to cities and counties trying to build public safety ditches to help prevent flooding. \\nIn February, the EPA and Corps\\npublished their proposed\\nnew definition of “waters of the United States.” To the agencies’ credit, they\\nare doing something different: They actually are trying to respect the rule of\\nlaw and the plain language of the Clean Water Act.\\nThey are not including in the\\ndefinition, for example, ephemeral waters (dry land\\nexcept when it holds water a few days a year after heavy precipitation).\\nBut\\nthis doesn’t mean that the proposed rule is very good. The agencies should make\\nimportant changes to the final rule, including: \\n1.\\nProperly Define Traditional Navigable\\nWaters\\n\\nTraditional navigable waters are waters that serve as the foundation of the\\nproposed new definition. Other waters are regulated if they have certain\\nconnections to these traditional navigable waters.\\n\\nThe proposed rule would define traditional\\nnavigable waters as “waters which are\\ncurrently used, or were used in the past, or may be susceptible to use in\\ninterstate or foreign commerce … ”\\xa0 \\nThe problem is this broad definition\\nwould ignore long-standing law, starting with a 1870 Supreme Court case called The Daniel Ball, stressing that traditional navigable waters\\nmust be used or susceptible to use as “highways for commerce,” and “trade and\\ntravel” is or may be conducted\\xa0 on these\\nwaters.\\xa0 \\nThe necessary commerce that must take\\nplace on the water is not a stationary activity, such as something\\nrecreational, but instead part of a commercial activity that helps move that\\nactivity along a channel of interstate or foreign commerce.\\xa0 \\nIt\\nis therefore critical that the EPA and\\nCorps clarify that the waters must be used for the transport of commerce.\\xa0 \\nThe proposed rule also appears to allow waters to be considered traditional navigable waters if they were used in the past for commerce, even if they are not used for commerce now or susceptible to use in commerce.\\nThe final rule should clarify that, at a minimum, any water that is deemed a traditional navigable water must currently be susceptible to use in commerce. \\n\\xa02. Exclude Intermittent Waters  The proposed rule would regulate intermittent waters and states that “‘intermittent’ means surface water flowing continuously during certain times of a typical year and more than in direct response to precipitation” (such as when the groundwater table is elevated or when snowpack melts).\\xa0 \\nThis definition could include\\na vast amount of waters, including waters that in many ways might look like\\nephemeral waters. \\nThe Obama rule regulated\\ntoo many waters, including waters that generally would be considered land. The\\nproposed rule appears to have some of the same problems because of this\\nintermittent definition. \\nJustice Antonin Scalia’s plurality opinion in the 2005 Supreme Court case\\xa0Rapanos v. United States, which addressed the WOTUS definition, excluded intermittent waters. It stressed the importance of waters being “relatively permanent” and “standing or continuously flowing” and also argued that at a bare minimum there must be “the ordinary presence of water.”\\nIt is true that in a footnote to the case, Scalia acknowledged that the plurality of justices wasn’t excluding seasonal rivers such as a stream that has continuous flow for 290 days in a year or waters that dry up in extraordinary circumstance such as drought. \\nAny final rule should be consistent with the high court’s plurality opinion in Rapanos and exclude intermittent waters. This would also mean that a seasonal water could be regulated if there is an extraordinary circumstance such as drought or the water has continuous flow, such as the 290-day stream mentioned in the case. \\nThe continuous flow arguably could be shorter, but it would need to be at least a majority of the year for various reasons, including the need to have the “ordinary presence of water.”\\xa0 \\xa0\\nThe Trump administration needs to get the definition of “waters of the United States” right.\\xa0It isn’t enough merely to get rid of the Obama rule and replace it with a rule that still has many problems.\\xa0 \\nThe proposed rule was a good start, however, and with significant changes, the final rule can be a win for the rule of law, property owners, and the environment.',\n",
       " 'Gabriella Beaumont-Smith\\n\\nGabriella Beaumont-Smith is a macroeconomics policy analyst at The Heritage Foundation.\\nThere was some good news Wednesday on the agricultural\\ntrade front. \\nThe Office of the United States Trade Representative just announced several key provisions of the new U.S.-Japan agreement that would benefit U.S. agricultural producers and American consumers. \\nIf the agreement goes into effect (the agreement is not yet final), American farmers and ranchers will soon find it easier to export their goods to Japan, the third-largest U.S. agricultural export market in 2018. \\nJapan moved up from fourth place, overtaking China, whose rank has gone down as a result of the trade dispute.\\nAccording\\nto the Office of the United States Trade Representative:\\nOut of the $14.1 billion in U.S. food and agricultural products imported by Japan in 2018, $5.2 billion were already duty free.\\xa0Under this first-stage initial tariff agreement, Japan will eliminate or reduce tariffs on an additional $7.2 billion of U.S. food and agricultural products.\\xa0 \\nFor many commodities, the agreement will require Japan to treat U.S. producers equally with producers from other major Japanese trading partners such as the EU, Australia, and Canada.\\xa0As explained by the American Farm Bureau Federation:\\nUnder the agreement, Japan will place the same level of agricultural tariffs on U.S. goods as it places on CPTPP countries [Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership countries] and the EU. By way of example, the 38.5% tariff on U.S. beef will fall to the 26% placed on beef from Australia, Canada and the EU. Some other foods such as duck, geese, turkey peaches, melons and more would enter duty-free.\\nHowever, the agreement doesn’t address improving market access for key U.S. commodities such as rice and soybeans. (Soybeans already enter the Japan market duty-free and rice was not addressed by the agreement.)\\xa0 Soybeans have been hit especially hard by China’s retaliatory tariffs (soybean exports to China accounted for 57% of total soybean exports in 2017; that number dropped to 18% in 2018).\\xa0\\nHowever, many commodities such as pork,\\nvegetables, and dairy that have been significantly impacted by China’s\\nretaliatory tariffs would benefit from this new agreement with Japan.\\nFor many American farmers and ranchers, agricultural trade is a necessity, since they produce more than they can sell domestically.\\xa0Free trade makes it possible for them to find customers outside the U.S. for their production and to expand into new markets.\\xa0This new agreement will help farmers and ranchers better reach the critical Japanese market. \\nAgricultural exports, as explained by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, also have significant\\neconomy-wide benefits:\\nU.S. agricultural exports support output, employment, income, and purchasing power in both the farm and nonfarm sectors.\\xa0The $134.7 billion of agricultural exports in calendar year 2016 produced an additional $172.1 billion in economic activity for a total economic output of $306.8 billion … Agricultural exports, in 2016, required 1,097,000 full-time civilian jobs, which included 764,000 jobs in the nonfarm sector.\\nAs part of the agreement, the U.S. will also eliminate or reduce tariffs on numerous Japanese imports, including green tea, soy sauce, and chewing gum. The affected import categories had a value of $40 million in 2018. \\nUltimately, this agreement is a good\\nstep forward in helping to liberalize agricultural trade.\\nThis new agreement shows that negotiation can lead to\\nimportant results in promoting the freedom to trade.\\nTrade is often discussed in connection with how it affects countries, but,\\nas a general matter, trade is truly about the freedom of individuals and\\nbusinesses to voluntarily exchange goods and services with customers.\\nAs a general principle, American farmers and ranchers, just like other\\nbusinesses, should be free to sell to customers all over the world, including\\nJapan. Further, consumers should be free to purchase goods and services that\\nbest meet their needs, regardless of national origin. \\nGovernment-imposed barriers, such as tariffs imposed by Japan or the U.S.,\\nundermine these freedoms. As the U.S. works through trade challenges, this\\nprinciple of freedom to trade should be front and center.\\nAccording\\nto the Office of the United States Trade Representative, “President Trump and Prime Minister Abe have agreed\\nthat these early outcomes will be followed by further negotiations to address\\nremaining areas of interest to each government.” \\nMore free trade with Japan, including agricultural\\ntrade, shouldn’t end with this agreement.\\xa0',\n",
       " 'The House just passed a massive amnesty bill that would give millions of illegal agricultural workers and their spouses and children a pathway to citizenship.\\nProponents of the legislation, known as the Farm Workforce Modernization Act, try to use concerns for farmers and agricultural labor shortages as a pretext for what is first and foremost one of the most extreme illegal immigration bills in recent memory.\\nLet’s assume for the sake of argument that agricultural labor shortages need to be addressed through the immigration system. Then logically, legislation would focus on how to improve legal pathways for aliens seeking to come to the United States for agricultural work, such as by fixing the H-2A temporary agricultural worker program.\\nBut the bill, through its amnesty provisions, unnecessarily goes way beyond this.\\nThe amnesty plan starts by creating something called “certified agricultural worker status.” If you are working in agriculture and want to stay in the U.S., you are much better off if you are illegally in the country, as opposed to the “suckers” who decided to follow the law. This is because the new certified agricultural worker status is generally only available to illegal agricultural workers.\\nOnce illegal agricultural workers secure certified agricultural worker status, they can stay in the country for at least five and a half years and have begun their pathway to citizenship.\\nIt’s important to recognize that the amnesty provisions are so extreme that they don’t simply allow these illegal workers to change to H-2A status like legal agricultural workers currently in the country. No, they actually get a lot more than that through this special pathway.\\nCertified agricultural workers can easily renew this special new status on an indefinite basis. They are also eligible to be lawful permanent residents (i.e., get their green cards) in a fairly quick manner.\\nIf the illegal agricultural worker has worked in agriculture for at least 10 years prior to enactment of the law, then they are required to be certified agricultural workers for four years before getting their green cards. If they have not met this 10-year requirement, then they have to be certified agricultural workers for eight years.\\nTo clarify, this doesn’t mean the law requires 14 or 18 years of additional work in agriculture. It only requires four or eight more years of working in agriculture. Then, the illegal agricultural workers can get their green cards and, under existing law, these lawful permanent residents can generally become citizens after five years.\\nAs many of these agricultural workers move to lawful permanent resident status and then to citizenship, there’s no reason to think they would simply continue to work as farmworkers. \\nThis amnesty plan, which allegedly exists in part to help farmers with their labor needs, would likely have only a limited short-term benefit to farmers as existing workers move off the farm to work in other occupations and in different areas of the country. \\nThis movement away from the farm is precisely what happened when the United States granted amnesty to more than 1 million agricultural workers in 1986.\\nThe sheer scope of this proposed amnesty would be massive. An estimated 50% to 70% of U.S. farmworkers are in the country illegally. There are likely at least 1.5 million illegal agricultural workers, with estimates above 2 million. This doesn’t even include the spouses and children who would get amnesty as well.\\nThis entire plan rewards those individuals who have illegally come into the country and the agricultural employers who have employed them. There’s also nothing that would do more harm to legal immigration reform than this amnesty, which threatens the legal immigration system’s legitimacy and reason for existing.\\nAfter all, any new reforms to the legal immigration system would be severely undermined from the outset because the message of amnesty is clear: Aliens and employers can ignore the legal immigration system when it best serves their needs.\\nThere should be a thoughtful discussion and debate about legal immigration reform, including labor issues within the agricultural sector. The solution is to solve the problems with our laws, not to pass an amnesty law that would bless the actions of aliens and agricultural employers who have ignored the law altogether.',\n",
       " 'The Trump administration has just taken an important\\nstep in the effort to protect threatened and endangered species. \\nOn Monday, the administration published final\\nregulations that will improve\\nimplementation of the Endangered Species Act. \\nThis law simply hasn’t worked. Over the law’s more\\nthan 45 years, only about\\n3%\\nof the species listed\\nas threatened or endangered have been removed\\nfrom the list due to recovery.\\nTo their credit, the Fish and Wildlife Service and the\\nNational Marine Fisheries Service decided\\nto take action. They recognized that a significant part of the problem is\\nconnected to how they have implemented the law. \\nHere are three of their important changes.\\n1. No longer treating threatened species as if they were endangered.\\nThe Endangered Species Act applies its most significant protections to species classified\\nas “endangered,” including very stringent prohibitions against activities that\\nwould harm species or their habitats. This includes severe restrictions on how\\nprivate property owners can use their land.\\nBut for threatened species, the Endangered\\nSpecies Act’s general rule is that these stringent\\nprohibitions don’t apply. \\nUnfortunately, the Fish and Wildlife Service has\\nimplemented the law in the exact opposite fashion: The general rule is that\\nthese prohibitions do apply to threatened species.\\nThis misguided approach hurts conservation\\nefforts by diverting time and resources away from where they are most needed.\\nIt also removes important incentives for private property owners. For example,\\nif the stringent prohibitions didn’t apply to threatened species, private\\nproperty owners would have the incentive to protect these species from becoming\\nendangered in order to avoid these stringent prohibitions.\\nFortunately, the final regulations would require the Fish and Wildlife Service to properly follow the law and\\ntreat endangered and threatened species differently from each other. This would\\nbe consistent with what Congress intended and follows what the National Marine Fisheries Service has been doing successfully for years.\\xa0 \\nThis change would have no impact on\\nthreatened species that have already been listed. This only applies to future\\nlisted species.\\n2. Promoting much-needed transparency. \\nThe Endangered Species Act requires that science alone should determine whether to\\nlist a species. The costs of protecting a species has nothing to do with\\nwhether it is endangered or threatened. \\nHowever, the federal government has used this\\nscience-only requirement as an excuse to prohibit the identification of the\\nbenefits and costs of listing a species.\\nBased on the final regulations, the federal government would\\nstill make listing decisions without considering costs, but would start to\\nidentify and communicate the impacts of these listing decisions.\\xa0 \\nThere\\nis nothing novel about informing the public about cost data that isn’t used in\\nagency decision-making. This is exactly what the Environmental Protection\\nAgency does when designating the National Ambient Air Quality Standards.\\nWhen legislators and the public know what the\\nactual costs and benefits are for conserving species, they can better\\nunderstand the Endangered Species Act and\\nhow existing law might be changed to achieve desired policy outcomes.\\n3. Stopping critical habitat designations that don’t help to conserve species. \\nUnder the Endangered Species Act, the federal government designates critical\\nhabitat for listed species, which may include areas that are not occupied by\\nthe species. These unoccupied areas, however, must be essential to the\\nconservation of the species.\\xa0 \\nThe new final regulations would help to ensure any unoccupied areas are truly essential, and therefore help to prevent extreme situations, such as what happened in Louisiana.\\nIn that case, the Fish and Wildlife Service determined\\nthat 1,544 acres of land in Louisiana was “critical habitat” for an endangered\\nspecies known as the dusky gopher frog.\\xa0This was despite the fact the\\ndusky gopher frog has not been seen in Louisiana in over 50 years and couldn’t\\neven survive on the property.\\xa0\\nAs the Pacific Legal Foundation’s Mark Miller,\\nwho represented the property owners in the case, recently stated,\\n“The feds may as well have labeled this Louisiana property critical habitat for\\na polar bear. It would have done just as much good.”\\n***\\nThe administration’s new final\\nregulations are designed to better protect species. They may pose a problem for\\nthose who are more interested in blocking development than the welfare of\\nthreatened and endangered species. For those though who want to improve recovery\\nefforts, these regulations are an important step forward.',\n",
       " 'Thursday saw a major win for the rule of law, property rights, and the environment: The Trump administration announced that it had finalized its repeal of President Barack Obama’s infamous 2015 Clean Water Rule.\\nFor decades, the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have struggled to define the Clean Water Act’s term “waters of the United States” in a manner that can pass judicial scrutiny.\\xa0 \\nThat definition is extremely important, because it clarifies what waters the agencies can regulate under the statute.\\nInstead of learning from past mistakes, the Obama administration decided it would take the federal overreach to a new level while ignoring the plain language of the Clean Water Act.\\nThere’s a reason why there was such diverse and widespread opposition to this Obama rule: It’s a rule that could have made it very difficult for Americans to engage in even ordinary activities, such as farming or building a home.\\nThe Obama rule\\nwas so extreme it would have regulated waters that couldn’t even be seen by the\\nnaked eye.\\xa0 \\nThe American Farm\\nBureau Federation explained:\\n…distant regulators using “desktop tools” can conclusively establish the presence of a “tributary” on private lands, even where the human eye can’t see water or any physical channel or evidence of water flow. \\nThat’s right—invisible tributaries! \\nThe agencies even claim “tributaries” exist where remote sensing and other desktop tools indicate a prior existence of bed, banks, and [ordinary high-water marks], where these features are no longer present on the landscape today. \\xa0\\nThe rule would\\nhave made it possible to regulate “waters” that were, in effect, dry land, such\\nas a depression in land that holds water a few days a year after heavy\\nprecipitation.\\nThen there’s the “we will know a regulated water when we see it” aspect of the rule. If waters didn’t fall under specific categories as listed in the rule, then the Obama rule created a backup plan to help ensure the agencies could still have the ability to regulate additional waters.\\xa0 \\n>>> Related: EPA Repeals ‘Power Grab’ Water Rule It Says Stifled Innovation\\nThe rule made it\\npossible for the agencies to regulate some waters on a case-by-case basis if\\nthey decided that the water had a “significant nexus” to certain regulated\\nwaters.\\xa0 \\nA property owner\\ncouldn’t have known what this would cover, because such determinations would have\\nbeen at the subjective whim of agency officials. \\nThat’s particularly problematic because the Clean Water Act has both civil and criminal penalties.\\nThe ongoing vagueness problem with the Clean Water Act is a concern that the Supreme Court has repeatedly brought up, including then-Justice Anthony Kennedy, who stated in 2016 in the oral argument for Army Corps of Engineers v. Hawkes Co., “[T]he Clean Water Act is unique in both being quite vague in its reach, arguably unconstitutionally vague, and certainly harsh in the civil and criminal sanctions it puts into practice.”\\nAt the start of\\nthe Clean Water Act, Congress made it clear that it’s “the policy of the Congress\\nto recognize, preserve, and protect the primary responsibilities and rights of\\nStates to prevent, reduce, and eliminate pollution … .”\\nThe Obama rule ignored this state role.\\xa0When the federal government tries to regulate every water imaginable, it doesn’t leave much room for states and local governments to address water issues.\\nCritics will argue that getting rid of this vast federal role in regulating waters will undermine water protection. Congress rejected that argument when it passed the Clean Water Act.\\nLegislators recognized that states should play the lead role in addressing water pollution. That makes sense, because states are in the best position to address most water issues, and that’s because they are closest to the issues and can develop policy that’s tailored to address specific problems.\\nThe Clean Water\\nAct regulations are also just one piece in a massive web of laws and programs\\nthat helps to protect surface waters. (In addition to other federal programs\\nand laws, there is, of course, state and local governments.) \\nIt should also be\\nnoted that a separate federal law, the Safe Drinking Water Act, protects the\\nwater we drink.\\nBy getting rid of\\nthe Obama rule, the Trump administration appears to recognize the rule’s\\nnumerous problems. Now, it will be up to the Trump administration to develop a\\ndefinition of “waters of the United States” that does something unique; namely,\\none that follows the law. \\nOn Feb. 14, the\\nEPA and the Army Corps of Engineers proposed their new definition, which is a major\\nimprovement from the Obama rule.\\nThere are still improvements that are needed before any new definition is finalized. Justice Antonin Scalia in his plurality opinion in Rapanos v. United States wrestled with many of the challenges that admittedly the agencies face when developing a workable definition of “waters of the United States.”\\nIf the final rule is consistent with this thoughtful opinion, then the Trump administration will succeed where past administrations have failed in developing a workable, legally defensible definition of “waters of the United States.”\\nUntil then, the Trump administration should be commended for getting rid of the Obama rule, which failed on all counts.',\n",
       " 'Shouldn’t Environmental Protection Agency regulations do more good than harm?\\nThe agency hasn’t always thought so.\\nIn 2012, under President Barack Obama, the EPA finalized a rule to reduce emissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants from coal- and oil-fired power plants. \\nIn doing so, the agency decided that it didn’t need to consider the rule’s costs, estimated at $9.6 billion per year—roughly 2,000 times more than its annual benefits of only $4 million to $6 million.\\nFortunately, the U.S. Supreme Court directed the agency to take costs into consideration based on specific Clean Air Act language applicable to that rule. If the EPA had its way though, costs wouldn’t have been considered.\\nThat cavalier attitude is evident in other major air regulations, where the EPA didn’t bother to quantify whether there would be any benefits for reducing emissions of the regulated pollutant.\\nNow, however, there’s reason to hope that some common sense might finally be coming to the EPA.\\nIn May, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler issued a memorandum directing the agency to “ensure that its regulatory decisions are rooted in sound, transparent and consistent approaches to evaluating benefits and costs.”\\nThe full scope of what this process will entail isn’t clear. However, it appears that various offices within the EPA will be proposing rules to codify important principles of cost-benefit analysis into the agency’s work.\\nThe memo explains that “the EPA should evaluate and consider both benefits and costs in decision-making.” The fact that such an obvious point has to be made is sadly instructive.\\nThis entire effort shouldn’t be, and doesn’t appear to be, a scheme to reduce regulations per se. But the need for a reasonable, objective, and predictable way to make regulatory decisions is quite evident.\\nRegulators shouldn’t be allowed to work backward, deciding what policy they want and then gaming (or ignoring) cost-benefit analysis to reach their preferred policy outcomes. \\nBy codifying basic regulatory principles through the rule-making process, the EPA will have a more difficult time going back to the “anything goes” mentality that exists now.\\nThere must be a reasonable and transparent process in how the EPA comes up with its regulations. Make no mistake, these EPA regulations have a major impact on the lives of all Americans. \\nIn addition to environmental objectives, these regulations impact everything from energy costs, infrastructure development, and transportation, to whether a farm includes some dry land that is actually a regulated water under the Clean Water Act.\\nIn moving forward with this process, the EPA should codify basic principles of cost-benefit analysis that have been well-established over the years through various means, including executive orders and Office of Management and Budget documents.\\nFor example, the agency should carefully evaluate to what extent existing regulations or laws contribute to the problem that the agency wants to address. \\nThe EPA should also evaluate alternatives to regulation and choose an alternative that achieves the regulatory objective while posing the least burden on society.\\nThe EPA should identify where regulations are outdated, duplicative, and unnecessary. Further, unless expressly prohibited in statute, the EPA should assume that cost-benefit analysis is required across the board.\\nAs with the EPA, Congress delegates far too much power to other agencies and is arguably unlawfully delegating its lawmaking power. This is certainly a critical problem that needs to be addressed.\\nBut to the extent agencies are able to exercise this enormous and largely unchecked power, there should be some reasonable rules of the game so that their decision-making is based on sound economic principles. \\nThis in no way should suggest that cost-benefit analysis is a panacea for sound policymaking, but applying reasonable principles is far better than having none at all.\\nTo its credit, the EPA is taking on this important endeavor to help ensure the agency properly and consistently considers costs and benefits, now and in the future. Other agencies should follow suit.\\nThis article originally appeared in The Washington Times.',\n",

But the damage caused by the fight continues. \\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture is using the situation as an excuse to funnel more taxpayer money to the agricultural industry. It is spending $16 billion on trade aid for farmers affected by the trade fight with China. \\nThis is on top of the $12 billion in allegedly “one-time” aid provided to farmers last year in response to trade disputes with various countries, including China. \\nIf this wasn’t bad enough, it now appears the Department of Agriculture plans to use trade aid money to help farmers deal with nontrade-related issues.\\nSpecifically, some farmers who have been unable to plant their cash crops because of inclement weather may be eligible for crop insurance assistance that helps farmers when they are prevented from planting crops. But this does not and should not qualify them for trade aid. \\nEnter the “cover crop.” As opposed to primary cash\\ncrops (crops sold for the market) such as corn, wheat, and soybeans, farmers\\nuse cover crops for secondary purposes such as soil health, livestock forage,\\nor as a backup in case of bad weather. \\nThe Department of Agriculture has informed farmers who were prevented from planting cash crops, due to the weather, that they still could get some trade aid if they plant cover crops. \\nThe agency is not only transferring trade assistance money to help with weather-related harm, but it is also influencing planting decisions by encouraging farmers to plant crops they otherwise may not have grown. \\nThis diversion of trade aid to nontrade-related matters only exacerbates the flawed policy of providing trade aid to farmers in the first place. \\nU.S. tariffs imposed on China have inevitably led to retaliatory\\ntariffs on U.S. goods, including agricultural products. American families are hurt\\nthrough higher prices and taxpayers are hurt through paying for the special\\ntrade aid for farmers.\\nMany industries, not just agriculture, are hurt\\nthrough higher costs of imports and lost market opportunities\\nin China. Yet, the agricultural industry receives preferential treatment even\\nthough farmers already receive\\nbillions of dollars per year in existing crop subsidies.\\nEven\\nworse, this special agriculture trade aid also can create a justification for\\nmaintaining and even expanding tariffs, instead of opening up trade\\nopportunities. In fact, that appears to be happening now.\\nWith the federal government running enormous annual deficits that are partially financed by Chinese purchases of U.S. debt, Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, correctly noted that “[w]e are borrowing money from China to pay our farmers to not sell their crops to China.”\\nUltimately, the solution is to end the tariffs and commit to promoting freedom to trade. Until that can be achieved, the Department of Agriculture should stop trade aid and certainly not funnel money to farmers for nontrade-related issues. \\nTrade is truly about the freedom of\\nindividuals and businesses, including farmers, to voluntarily exchange goods\\nand services with customers.\\nAs the U.S. works through trade\\nchallenges with China, this principle of freedom\\nto trade should be front and center.

Despite being China’s most valuable export category to the U.S., key electronics (including the iPhone) were notably spared at the last minute.\\nNot every business has been as lucky as Apple, even though the logic—that tariffs harm domestic consumers and, therefore, domestic companies—surely applies to others.\\nTrump has said that small-business owners are the “engine of American prosperity,” though his trade policies have been the engineering equivalent of pouring water in the gas tank.\\nTariffs place additional burdens on domestic firms, who must pay more for input materials, and in response, must raise prices to their customers.\\nAs is evident with Apple, large companies with political sway have the ability to get key exemptions, while small businesses are left without protection from tariffs’ consequences.\\nFor example, Mid Continent Nail Corp., a nail manufacturer in Poplar Bluff, Missouri, has lost 200 employees, seen a 25 percent increase in costs, and raised prices by 19 percent.\\nOther small businesses—such as Howard-McCray, Duncanson Growers, Highlands Family Farm, and Schaefer’s—have argued that imports are integral to their businesses and that tariffs have increased their production costs.\\nApple is a massive player in the American economy and recently announced major U.S. investments—$350 billion, a new headquarters, and 20,000 jobs—in response to Trump’s tax cuts.\\nCook has worked closely with the president and advised him of the disruptions that would result from tariffs on consumer products.\\nLarry Kudlow, the top White House economic adviser, has described a symbiotic relationship between the Apple CEO and the administration. “He was very helpful in making some suggestions, and I might also add he loves the tax cut and tax reform,” Kudlow told CNBC after an April meeting in the West Wing.\\nIt makes sense, then, that the president would protect Apple and other tech firms from the growth-slowing consequences of his tariffs.\\nHowever, many small businesses are losing out because of those reckless policies, as they do not have a line to the president’s ear or the political capital to protect themselves.\\nTariffs are an ineffective tool to combat trade abuses because they harm the people at home and disrupt the supply chains that American businesses rely on.\\nWhile often referred to as a “protectionist” policy, tariffs in fact expose many small firms to new risks and higher costs of materials.\\nApple has effectively dodged tariffs on its products so far, despite being a prime target in Trump’s mission to bring manufacturing back to the U.S.\\nApple is no doubt a large player in the economy, and the direct effect of taxing them may be more apparent than taxing a smaller-scale enterprise, such as a Missouri nail manufacturer.\\nBut giving Apple a sweetheart deal while sticking small businesses with the bill represents exactly what’s wrong with cronyism in U.S. politics.',\n",
       " 'Gabriella Beaumont-Smith\\n\\nGabriella Beaumont-Smith is a macroeconomics policy analyst at The Heritage Foundation.\\nThe ongoing U.S.-China trade dispute is threatening\\nthe U.S. economy as a whole, and is hurting\\nAmerican farmers and ranchers.\\nIn recent years, China has been among the top two largest markets for U.S. agricultural exports. And much more potential for increased exports remains. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has said that “China offers our best opportunity for major export growth in the future.” \\nHowever, in 2018, the U.S. imposed major tariffs on Chinese goods. These U.S. tariffs are a self-inflicted wound on the entire economy, including the agricultural sector, and could limit opportunities in China. The tariffs have created a tit-for-tat situation in which China responded with retaliatory tariffs, making it more difficult for U.S farmers and ranchers to export their products to China. \\nThe tariffs serve as a tax on a wide range of imported\\ngoods. It is not Chinese businesses, but American businesses that pay for the\\ntariffs when importing Chinese goods, and then they likely pass the costs on to\\ntheir customers.\\xa0\\nThe Congressional Research Service has explained\\nthat China “has levied retaliatory tariffs on about 800 U.S. food and agricultural\\nproducts that were worth about $20.6 billion in exports to that country in\\n2017.”\\nAs shown in the table below, China is imposing significant tariffs on important U.S. agricultural exports, such as soybeans (25 percent), many pork products (50 percent for many of these products),and sorghum (25 percent).\\nThe retaliatory tariffs could cause long-term damage to U.S. agricultural exports to China.\\xa0This is in part due to other countries stepping in to meet Chinese demand and a breakdown in some trading relationships that American farmers and ranchers have already forged in China.\\xa0 \\nThe American Soybean Association has asserted\\nthat when and if the U.S. rescinds the Section 301 tariffs on China, and China\\nthen lifts its 25 percent retaliatory tariffs, “the process of rebuilding the\\nU.S. [soybean] market in China could take years.” \\nOne of the most telling statistics showing the harms\\nof this trade dispute is the USDA’s current forecast\\nthat in 2019, China will drop from the second-largest to the fifth-largest\\nagricultural export market for the United States.\\nTo prevent this harm, the United States should act now to eliminate the tariffs. Admittedly, this wouldn’t help the U.S. to address China’s alleged unfair trade practices. But the U.S. can do that by making greater use of the World Trade Organization dispute settlement system.\\xa0In fact, one of the best features of the World Trade Organization is that it provides a legal venue to challenge foreign trade barriers.\\nThe U.S. has had major success using\\nthe World Trade Organization dispute settlement process in the past. For\\nexample:\\nThe United States government has initiated 29 dispute settlement proceedings over other [World Trade Organization] members’ barriers to U.S. farm exports. The United States achieved a ‘victory’—an affirmative ruling and/or the elimination or modification of the measure at issue—in every single [World Trade Organization] case that moved beyond the first government-to-government ‘consultations’ stage (and even in many of the consultations-only disputes). \\nIn fact, just\\na few weeks ago, the United States won a\\nmajor World Trade Organization case against China over improper agricultural\\nsubsidies. \\nIn 1988, President Ronald Reagan delivered\\na radio address to the nation in which he espoused the benefits of free trade:\\n[O]ne of the key factors behind our nation’s great prosperity is the open trade policy that allows the American people to freely exchange goods and services with free people around the world. … Over the past 200 years, not only has the argument against tariffs and trade barriers won nearly universal agreement among economists, but it has also proven itself in the real world, where we have seen free-trading nations prosper while protectionist countries fall behind.\\nReagan’s words were true then, and they remain true today. A commitment to free trade will help the United States as a whole to prosper, and will expand opportunities for the nation’s farmers and ranchers to sell even more of their products around the world.',\n",
       " \"The popular method of measuring Chinese GDP inflates China's real economic capacity by roughly 50 percent. (Photo: yongyuan/Getty Images)\\n\\nGabriella Beaumont-Smith\\n\\nGabriella Beaumont-Smith is a macroeconomics policy analyst at The Heritage Foundation.\\nChina is a rising economic power that will threaten the United States’ place as the world’s biggest economy.\\nAt least, that’s the narrative we’ve become familiar with. But does it really hold up?\\nEconomists use gross domestic product to measure the size and growth of national economies. GDP is based on the real value of what is produced. It’s usually measured by calculating how much money was spent in one country during a single year.\\nIn terms of GDP growth, no country has been hyped up more than China. The World Bank reported that in 2017, China had become the world’s largest economy with a GDP topping $23 trillion. By comparison, United States GDP in 2017 was just over $19 trillion.\\nIndeed, China’s growth has been impressive. Over the last 25 years, its economy has grown at an average rate of 9.6 percent a year.\\nBut China’s economy still isn’t as big as it’s often advertised, and that’s because a misleading measure is used. The measure is called the purchasing power parity exchange rate. This exchange rate tells us how much money you would need in China to be as wealthy as you are in the United States.\\nThis is not an appropriate way to compare the relative size of countries.\\nConsider: If you go on vacation to Mexico, you know that things will be cheaper there, so you won’t have to exchange the same amount of dollars that you spend at home in the United States. This allows you to take less money with you, or to treat yourself and buy more than you normally would.\\nThe purchasing power parity exchange rates are an extremely useful way to measure development and predict where a country might aim its GDP to achieve the same living standards as the United States. But to actually compare the sizes of the economies, it is better to use the regular market exchange rates, like you would to change your dollars to another currency.\\nOn this measure, the GDP of China was actually about $14 trillion, not $21 trillion, in 2017. That’s still a huge number, but it’s not as big as the United States, which had a GDP of $19.5 trillion that year.\\n\\nIn practical terms, this means China doesn’t have as great a capacity to spend as is being advertised.\\nThis is especially important to understand when talking about trade.\\nGDP is an indicator of a country’s economic footprint on the world stage. So, it’s important to understand the extent to which its economic size could disrupt global markets.\\nWhen countries trade with one another, they also use market exchange rates to convert to the currencies that they need. For example, when the United States imports from China, China must accept U.S. dollars based on the market exchange rate that you see at your bank.\\nSimilarly for exporters, when the U.S. exports to China, the U.S. has to accept yuan at the market exchange rate.\\nThe inappropriate use of purchasing power parity exchange rates to measure economic capacity has fueled the misconception that China is a giant that threatens the U.S. for economic dominance. This in turn has fueled support for tariffs, which only harm our economy by raising prices for imported goods and raw materials.\\nThe bottom line: China’s economy is large, but by an accurate measure, it’s not yet as big as the U.S. economy. The administration should be wary of threatening China with tariffs. While China is not as powerful as advertised, smooth relations with China are important for our livelihood and national well-being.\\nAs long as the two nations continue trading with each other, both the U.S. and Chinese economies will continue to flourish.\",\n",
       " 'Ryan Hein\\n\\nRyan Hein is a member of the Young Leaders Program at The Heritage Foundation.\\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has been one of the strongest and boldest reforms of President Donald Trump’s first term in office. According to analysis from The Heritage Foundation, the tax law will give hardworking Americans tax breaks in every congressional district and in every state.\\nAcross the nation at large, the average American will take home on average $1,400 more of their paycheck in 2018. For married couples with two children, that figure doubles to just under $3,000.\\n>>> You can find the average tax cut in your district here.\\nWhile higher-taxed districts will see more in dollar savings as a result of the tax cuts, they are certainly not the only winners from the Trump tax cuts. In fact, lower-income districts will feel more relief in their tax burden, as they will see a higher percentage of their taxes cut than Americans in higher-income areas.\\nFor example, in New York’s 15th Congressional District, tax filers on average will notice a decrease of over 30 percent in their tax bill in 2018.\\nAll across the country, the manifestations of this policy are quite impressive. Americans are better off from the tax cuts because they get to keep a larger portion of their paychecks. Moreover, the changes in tax rates are providing better economic incentives leading to even higher paychecks.\\nLower tax rates mean businesses invest more and consequently demand more labor. Greater labor demand means that businesses hire more workers and increase wages. As a result, American workers get a bigger piece of a bigger economic pie.\\nAs a result, Texas’ 7th Congressional District can expect to see on average $35,000 more in take-home pay over the next 10 years. By the same year, a family of four in Virginia’s 10th Congressional District should enjoy an average of almost $70,000 of their own money back in their pocket. This money can then be spent on daycare, college tuition, or retirement savings, among many others.\\nUnfortunately, some in Congress have called to undo this tax reform, which would effectively wipe out the benefits of the law. According to our analysis, the cost of repealing the tax cuts in 2020 would be an average of $26,906 in lost income gains over the following 10 years. For a family of four, that cost would be over $45,000.\\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is allowing Americans in every community across the nation to take home more of their paycheck. Congress should not only keep the law in place but should also work toward making the law permanent well before the its current 2025 “sunset” date.',\n",
       " 'Sarina Singh\\n\\nSarina Singh is a member of the Young Leaders Program at The Heritage Foundation.\\nWith the health care debate currently dominating headlines, many Americans may be unaware of a more subtle issue that is affecting the U.S. health care system.\\nThat issue is an increasing shortage of medical professionals. An analysis by the Association of American Medical Colleges estimates that by 2030, America will likely experience a shortage of anywhere between 40,800 and 104,900 physicians.\\nHowever, the problem has already gotten worse. As of May 25, the Health Resources and Services Administration had designated over 6,000 areas of the country as having a shortage of primary care providers.\\nThis issue is compounded by the fact that the demand for health care is expected to significantly increase within the next few decades.\\nA new Heritage Foundation policy paper, co-written by this author (Kevin Dayaratna), describes how changing demographics, an uneven geographic distribution of physicians, and government policy have all contributed to this impending health care crisis.\\nThe report elaborates on the various factors contributing to this crisis:\\nThe Association of American Medical Colleges projects that the number of Americans over the age of 65 will grow by 55 percent by 2030.\\nAs these people age, they will of course need more medical care. Additionally, as a third of physicians may retire in the next decade, they may not be adequately replaced in a manner commensurate with the projected increases in demand.\\nThe physician shortage is particularly striking in rural areas. In fact, the analysts note that “although nearly 20 percent of the country lives in rural areas, fewer than 10 percent of primary care providers practice there.”\\nDoctors tend to practice near the teaching hospitals where they completed their residency programs, and these hospitals are generally not located in rural areas.\\nThis shortcoming is in part due to the fact that funding for graduate medical education is often “focused on the narrow needs of the teaching hospital rather than the broader health care needs of the population as a whole.”\\nGraduate medical education, a pre-requisite for medical licensure as well as board certification to practice medicine in the United States, has failed to produce the appropriate supply and distribution of doctors to meet patient demand.\\nAs a result, many of these graduates cannot help treat patients even in areas of the country most desperately in need of care. Each year during the main residency match, there are several thousand medical graduates who do not place into a graduate medical education training position, and thus cannot acquire the training necessary to practice medicine in this country.\\nThe paper offers one possible way for state governments to begin to address the problem of physician shortages—especially shortages in primary care.\\nThat solution is to offer provisional medical licenses to qualified medical school graduates that were not able to attain residency positions to work under the structured supervision of a collaborating physician.\\n>>> Read the full Heritage Foundation paper here.\\nMissouri, Kansas, Arkansas, and Utah have already instituted such laws, which can also be significantly improved upon.\\nOffering provisional licenses to qualified medical graduates could both broaden the opportunities for medical graduates to receive training and help ameliorate the physician shortage.\\nGiven that physician assistants and nurse practitioners currently provide patient care with appropriate supervision, it only makes sense to provide the opportunity for qualified medical graduates to contribute to the health care system through collaboration with practicing physicians.\\nInnovative solutions such as these could ultimately spawn ideas about alternative training mechanisms that may be better able to respond to the demands of the changing health care marketplace.',\n",

Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies at The Heritage Foundation.\\n\\nRachel Greszler\\n\\nRachel Greszler is research fellow in economics, budget, and entitlements in the Grover M. Hermann Center for the Federal Budget, of the Institute for Economic Freedom, at The Heritage Foundation. Read her research.\\nSince the release of the GOP’s long-awaited tax reform plan, a flurry of commentators have criticized it, saying it is a regressive plan that will raise taxes on a sizable portion of Americans.\\nWhat they often fail to mention is that their estimates depend on details of the plan that have yet to be released. As it turns out, different assumptions about those details can dramatically alter the projections of who gets a tax cut under the GOP plan.\\nFor a vast majority of Americans, the main changes they would experience from the plan would be to their income tax rate, the standard deduction, the personal and dependent exemption, and the Child Tax Credit.\\nSo what do we know about how the GOP plan will affect these variables?\\n1. It would lower individual tax rates. \\nThe GOP’s framework would lower rates and consolidate tax brackets for individuals. The three new income tax brackets (down from seven) are 12, 25, and 35 percent, but the framework does not specify what the income thresholds will be.\\nThe plan also mentions that an additional fourth top rate may be added.\\n2. It would double the standard deduction. \\nThe framework would almost double the standard deduction. It would do so by collapsing the additional standard deduction and personal exemptions into the one larger deduction available to everyone.\\nFor married joint filers the deduction would be $24,000, and for single filers it would be $12,000. This means taxes would become much easier for many people because they won’t need to itemize or check frivolous boxes.\\n3. It would expand the Child Tax Credit. \\nThe framework would repeal the personal exemption for dependents, “significantly increase” the Child Tax Credit, and increase the income limits at which the credit currently begins to phase out.\\nThe framework gives no further details on these items.\\nTaken together, it is still uncertain how these changes will ultimately alter any individual or family’s tax liability. There are other proposed reforms that could also interact with these changes, but that hasn’t stopped commentators from projecting winners and losers.\\nOther analyses have simply mapped the current tax brackets on to the new rates so that the current 15 percent bracket would now pay 12 percent, the current 25 and 28 percent brackets make up the new 25 percent bracket, and the 33-39.6 percent brackets are consolidated into the 35 percent bracket.\\nThese assumptions are often biased. They keep many Americans paying the same tax rate and actually project an increase in some people’s rate. It’s very unlikely that these conservative lawmakers intend to do that.\\nIf we assume different income thresholds that are entirely reasonable, we find very different results.\\nOne could, for instance, raise the new income thresholds by 15 percent so that more people would pay a lower tax rate. Lower taxes are, after all, a key stated goal of the plan.\\nUsing The Heritage Foundation Individual Income Tax Model, we estimated what these changes—along with the other details released thus far—would mean for taxpayers. In particular, we modeled:\\nWith these three changes, some of our modeled income groups would end up paying slightly more in taxes because the lower rates and higher standard deductions don’t fully compensate for getting rid of the dependent exemption.\\nBut increasing the Child Tax Credit by a modest $100 flips all of our income groups into the black. And that’s even without increasing the credit’s income limits.\\nPairing this with the new larger standard deduction and lower tax rates, most families would end up paying less in taxes than they currently do. In fact, every income group would pay a lower tax bill.\\nThose households with adjusted gross income between $100,000 and $125,000, for example, would see a significant drop in their tax bill of about 6 percent.\\nThose with adjusted gross income below $50,000 would receive the smallest tax savings because they already pay very little in taxes. However, the Child Tax Credit would likely increase by $500 or more, which would largely benefit this group.\\nMoreover, other changes to state and local tax deductions and other provisions would likely shift some of the gains for upper-income earners toward middle- and lower-income earners.\\n(Of course, it is near impossible to enact pro-growth tax reform without some positive benefits for the individuals and small business that pay the majority of taxes, and the top 5 percent of taxpayers pay 60 percent of all federal income taxes.)\\nThese are perfectly reasonable assumptions to make about the details of the GOP plan, given the political promises that have been made. Tax cuts for middle-class Americans are going to be real.\\nThere are also several other possible changes that would alter our analysis, such as eliminating the state and local tax and municipal bond interest deductions (along with some other itemized deductions), creating the newly proposed nonrefundable credit of $500 for non-child dependent care, and nixing the alternative minimum tax.\\nRegardless of whether these changes occur, the GOP plan makes a huge stride by expanding the standard deduction. Given that 70 percent of Americans already take this deduction, our results show that the GOP plan may very likely result in a tax cut for Americans across the board.',\n",
       " 'President Donald Trump on Tuesday issued an “energy independence” executive order on energy and climate policy.\\nOne provision of this order pertains to the social cost of greenhouse gasses—in particular, the “social costs” of carbon, methane, and nitrous oxide. The previous administration had used these social costs to justify its extensive regulatory agenda across the energy sector of the economy.\\nThe Trump administration’s executive order stipulates that the Obama administration’s estimates of these costs should no longer be used for government policy. It also mandates that future cost-benefit analysis take into account the “best available science and economics” and specifically stipulates that recommendations outlined by the Office of Management and Budget be adhered to.\\nWe have discussed these issues extensively in our research at The Heritage Foundation, and the Trump administration should be commended for making these decisions. The social costs of carbon, methane, and nitrous oxide come from a class of statistical models that the Obama administration used to supposedly quantify the economic damages associated with carbon dioxide emissions.\\n\\nThere are three statistical models that are used for estimating these social costs: the DICE model, the FUND model, and the PAGE model.\\nAt The Heritage Foundation, we ran the DICE and FUND models and found them to be inherently unsound for regulatory policy and can be quite easily manipulated by user-selected assumptions. In fact, upon recalculating the social cost of carbon under the DICE model with much more reasonable assumptions, we found that the number arrived at can drop by well over 30 percent.\\n>>> Read Heritage experts’ analysis of the DICE model.\\xa0\\nIn addition to arbitrariness of essential components, their results are based on very questionable assumptions regarding the climate’s sensitivity, naïve projections reaching 300 years into the future, and ignorance of recommendations by the Office of Management and Budget regarding cost-benefit analysis.\\nWe also examined the FUND model. After finding a mistake in the model’s initial specification, we found that it is not only just as sensitive, but can even produce a negative estimate of the social cost of carbon under very reasonable assumptions.\\nThose assumptions even include regulatory standards currently suggested by the Office of Management and Budget, and which the Energy Independence Act now requires policymakers to adhere to.\\n>>>\\xa0Read Heritage experts’ analysis of the FUND model.\\nIronically, this negativity would suggest that the government should subsidize, not tax, carbon dioxide emissions.\\nIt became clearly evident that the Obama administration was using these flimsy models to rubber-stamp its environmental agenda and to manipulate and inflate the social cost of carbon.\\nBeyond the social cost of carbon, we also recently published research on the social costs of methane and nitrous oxide.\\n>>>\\xa0Read additional research by Heritage scholars on the social cost of carbon.\\nWe found that the models used for these estimates are also extremely sensitive to very reasonable changes in assumptions. The estimates of the “costs” associated with these greenhouse gases can drop by over 80 percent under different, yet very plausible, assumptions.\\nFurthermore, evidence shows that the Obama administration’s assumptions regarding climate sensitivity were outdated, and this skewed its calculations regarding the social cost of carbon.\\n>>>\\xa0Read Kevin Dayaratna’s testimony before Congress on this subject.\\xa0\\nIn additional peer-reviewed research, we found, alongside professor Ross McKitrick of the University of Guelph, that more up-to-date assumptions regarding climate sensitivity make it possible to take into account proper interactions regarding the oceans, which if not properly accounted for, can artificially inflate the social cost of carbon.\\n>>>\\xa0See Heritage experts’ peer-reviewed research on this subject.\\nWhile these models may be interesting academically, because they are so sensitive to very reasonable changes in assumptions, they can be easily manipulated by policymakers, regulators, and bureaucrats. As a result, they can form the basis for potentially burdensome energy regulations.\\nTrump’s newly signed executive order is thoroughly informed by the analyses described above. The administration should be strongly commended for recognizing the flawed nature of these old models, and for rescinding the Obama administration’s estimates of the social cost of greenhouse gases.',\n",

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., it’s a “bold idea” that would “create millions of good-paying jobs” and help “rebuild communities in rural America that have been devastated.”\\nOh, you thought the Green New Deal was all about fighting climate change? Well, think again. \\nTurns out it’s a green-glossed Trojan horse designed to increase government control over the economy.\\nJust ask Saikat Chakrabarti, chief of staff to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., the author of the deal. “The interesting thing about the Green New Deal is it wasn’t originally a climate thing at all,” Chakrabarti said. “We really think of it as a how-do-you-change-the-entire-economy thing.”\\nJust how much change would the Green New Deal bring to the economy? Put simply, it would bring it to its knees.\\nWe know, because when we tried to use the Energy Information Administration’s National Energy Model to assess how the plan would affect the economy, the model crashed.\\nThe Green New Deal is big on vision, but sparse on details. For example, it calls for reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 60% below 2010 levels by 2030, with the ultimate goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. But it doesn’t say how to get there.\\nOne thing is clear: to meet these goals, Washington would have to force all Americans to reduce their energy consumption and/or switch to “green” energy sources—and fast. And the only way to do that is to impose coercive taxes and regulations.\\nTo assess the economic effects of such a scheme, we started by looking at a carbon tax—the most popular recommendation of those asking government to “nudge” us off of fossil fuels.\\nUsing the Energy Information Administration’s model, we tested to see how high a carbon tax would have to go to meet the Green New Deal’s emission targets. We ratcheted the tax up to $300 per ton, which dropped emissions 58% below 2010 levels—but not until 2050.\\nThat left us far short of reaching the deal’s targets, but when we tried to push the tax higher, the model crashed. Clearly, the Green New Deal’s emission targets are unrealistic. Yet the danger they pose to the economy are far too real.\\nBefore the model’s lights went out, we found that a $300 per ton carbon tax and associated regulations would cost a family of four nearly $8,000 per year in income lost to higher energy costs, consumer prices, and foregone wages. The 20-year cost totals $165,000.\\nDuring that same 20-year period, the tax would siphon off an average of 1.1 million jobs per year and diminish gross domestic product by a total of more than $15 trillion.\\nThat’s a hefty price to pay for getting barely halfway to the net-zero emissions goal. Is it worth it? After all, proponents of eliminating conventional fuels argue that the cost of climate change dwarfs the cost of climate policy. \\nHowever, in terms of “climate insurance,” eliminating greenhouse gas emissions doesn’t get you very far.\\nTo see if this is true, we turned to another tool: the Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse Gas Induced Climate Change. Developed at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, this model assesses how much increases and decreases in greenhouse gas trajectories will affect global temperatures and sea levels.\\nRunning this model, we found that overhauling America’s economy—as envisioned in the Green New Deal—would abate global warming by approximately 0.2 degree Celsius by the year 2100. The reduction in sea-level rise would be less than 2 centimeters.\\nIn other words, the Green New Deal offers minimal climate improvement at impossibly high prices.\\nChakrabarti is spot on. The Green New Deal isn’t a “climate thing” at all. And it would certainly change the economy—for the worse.\\nOriginally distributed by the Tribune Content Agency.',\n",

To quantify the economic impact of\\nthe Green New Deal, we used the Heritage Energy Model, a derivative of the Energy Information\\nAdministration’s National Energy Modeling System. \\nAccording\\nto the Heritage Energy Model, as a result of the taxes and carbon-based\\nregulations, by 2040 one can expect: \\xa0\\nUnquestionably, these projections from the\\nHeritage Energy Model significantly underestimate the costs of the Green New\\nDeal’s energy components. As Ocasio-Cortez’s Frequently Asked Questions sheet notes,\\nthe carbon tax is only one of many policy tools Green New Deal advocates hope\\nto implement. \\nIn the same FAQ sheet, Ocasio-Cortez’s office argues that massive amounts of spending are necessary—and “government is best placed to be the prime driver.” In other words, the resolution’s co-sponsors expect the taxpayers to pay for a massive, economy-wide transition. \\nIf policymakers spent, taxed, and\\nregulated to achieve greenhouse gas-neutral energy, agricultural, and\\nindustrial sectors, the costs would be several orders of magnitude higher than\\nthose projected in the Heritage report. \\nGreen\\nNew Deal Barely Would Affect Climate \\nProponents of a carbon tax and the Green\\nNew Deal argue that these policies are a form of insurance against a changing\\nclimate. The cost of inaction, they purport, is much greater than any policies\\nthat drive energy prices higher. \\nHowever, the reality is these policies do\\nnot actually provide any “climate insurance.” No matter where one stands on the\\nurgency to combat climate change, the Green New Deal policies would be\\nineffective in abating temperature increases and slowing the rise of sea levels.\\nIn fact, the U.S. could cut its carbon dioxide emissions by 100 percent and it\\nwould not make a difference in global warming. \\nAccording to the Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse Gas Induced Climate Change, using a climate sensitivity of 4.5 degrees Celsius (the warming effect of a doubling of carbon dioxide emissions and an estimate exceeding recent research on the topic), the world would be less than 0.2 degree Celsius cooler by 2100. The rise of sea levels would be reduced by less than 2 centimeters.\\nSame Old Tax-and-Spend\\nCronyism\\nThe Green New Deal is not just an energy and\\nclimate policy: It is a plan to fundamentally transform the economy. \\nA Green New Deal as outlined by Ocasio-Cortez\\nwould be fiscally and economically catastrophic for American families and\\nbusinesses—all for no meaningful climate benefit. \\nThe plan is far from new and would introduce\\na completely new level of cronyism and corporate welfare that would harm Americans\\nall across the country.

Imagine having a child fall ill, but the nearest pediatrician being many miles away.\\nThis shortage is already affecting communities nationwide. Many have begun to lack much-needed medical services, and this pressure is most deeply felt in rural communities.\\nThe coming crisis has multiple causes, one being the aging pool of physicians. As older physicians begin to retire over the next decade, the number of physicians will drop. By 2030 there will be a shortage of as many as 104,900 physicians.\\nPart of this problem stems from the fact that medical residency programs—a training requirement that is a prerequisite for becoming a board-certified physician—are not churning out new doctors at a sufficient rate.\\nThe physician shortage problem is so bad that some states, like Missouri, have decided to bypass the residency requirement in order to attract medical graduates who are not able to participate in residency training programs.\\nUnder the supervision of a fully licensed physician, these graduates are to be given some form of provisional license, which would allow them to practice medicine for a limited time without a residency.\\nMany of these medical graduates are highly trained and educated, having passed the United States Medical Licensing Exams.\\nGiven that nurse practitioners and physician assistants are already given a significant amount of autonomy, allowing these graduates to practice in some capacity can only help curb the rising physician shortage.\\nLonger-term solutions should also involve fundamentally reforming graduate medical education. One such potential solution has been discussed at length by Heritage Foundation senior fellow and practicing surgeon Dr. John O’Shea.\\nHealth care is a critical issue for all Americans. As we move forward in the process of reforming our overall health care system, we must not forget the doctors who actually provide the care.\\nUntil we give American doctors more freedom to practice medicine across the country, the current restrictions will only continue to reduce access to care for the ordinary Americans politicians are trying to help.',\n",
       " 'Adam Michel\\n/\\n@adamnmichel\\n\\nAdam Michel focuses on tax policy and the federal budget as a policy analyst in the Thomas A. Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies at The Heritage Foundation.\\nCongress is set to unveil more details of its tax reform proposal this week, and many people fear that the death tax—also known as the estate tax and related gift taxes—will not be fully repealed.\\nNot repealing the death tax would literally be economic malpractice. The tax is a burden on family-owned businesses, slows economic growth, and contributes to large compliance burdens. It’s a costly burden that families often plan around.\\nPolitically, repeal of the death tax is even more of a no-brainer. No one likes the death tax. Killing it enjoys bipartisan support.\\nThe death tax is a 40 percent tax on the assets that one leaves behind after death above $5.45 million. It is intended to prevent the accumulation of wealth across generations.\\nUnfortunately, the tax has the unintended consequence of stifling economic growth.\\nThe largest estates are often those that include family-owned businesses. Family businesses appear valuable on paper, but it’s hard to pay a 40 percent tax on the value of your farm equipment without selling it or taking out a huge loan.\\nYou may have heard that less than 5,000 people pay the estate tax each year, so proponents of the tax will claim it has no measurable effect on businesses or the economy.\\nWhat proponents fail to recognize is that the tax incentivizes business owners to close or sell their companies before they die, spending down their investments rather than working to maintain their business for future generations.\\nThis practice hurts the economy because family-owned businesses are often hard to transfer to unrelated third parties. Forcing this transfer results in less business investment, which is ultimately what will create jobs, raise wages, and grow the economy.\\nIn fact, a Heritage Foundation study estimated that eliminating the death tax would result in an average of 18,000 private-sector jobs annually and would boost U.S. economic growth by more than $46 billion over 10 years due to increased investment.\\nPerhaps most perversely, however, the tax falls most heavily on those businesses and individuals who do not hire professional estate planners to minimize or entirely escape the tax.\\nThe National Taxpayers Union estimates the death tax requires nearly 2.1 million hours of compliance time a year, which costs over $100 million, resulting in costs of nearly $10,000 per filer.\\nFor an annual cost of billions of dollars of forgone economic output and millions of dollars of direct compliance costs, what are the purported benefits that people claim?\\nNaively, some people may believe that the death tax can help to address income inequality. Although income inequality has been shown not to impede opportunity, only a minuscule fraction (around 2 percent) of such inequality can even be attributed to inherited wealth in the first place. As a result, even if we taxed every penny of every estate, the tax would have little impact.\\nOther proponents hail the supposed revenue the death tax brings into Washington’s coffers. In reality, though, it accounts for less than 1 percent of all federal revenues.\\nAccording to the Tax Foundation, repealing the tax would only cost the federal government $19 billion over 10 years when taking into account the economic growth that would result. However, even this dynamic estimate still overstates the revenue loss because taxpayers currently give assets to relatives in lower-income tax brackets to avoid the tax.\\nRemoving the estate tax could actually bring in more revenue if assets are not shifted to relatives prematurely and thus taxed at the higher-income bracket of the estate owner.\\nDespite the economic damage wrought by the estate tax, there is a more compelling reason for Congress to repeal it: The estate tax is redundant.\\nThe estate tax is a second and often third layer of tax on income that is already subject to federal taxes. This last layer of tax is foisted on families at their most vulnerable time—when they have lost a loved one.\\nAn American’s death should not be a taxable event.\\nAs part of tax reform, Washington lawmakers would do well to kill the death tax immediately.',\n",
       " 'What would you buy with $26,000? A new car? A year of college tuition? A down payment on a house?\\nThis is not a hypothetical question. New research from The Heritage Foundation shows that the average American household can expect about $26,000 more in take-home pay over the next 10 years thanks to the tax reform that Congress passed last year.\\nBut where can you find the “average” American? With Heritage’s new online tool, you can see how the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will benefit the typical taxpayer in every congressional district. We’ve tailored our research to where you live. (Check it out here.)\\nThe big takeaway? Wherever you live, typical taxpayers in every congressional district will see a tax cut in 2018.\\nYou may have noticed this phenomenon already as your employer has started deducting less from your paycheck this year. The average American household can expect to pay about $1,400 less in taxes in 2018. But depending on where you live and how many kids you have, the numbers can look different.\\nIn communities that had high tax bills last year, such as Palo Alto, California’s district (CA-18) represented in the House by Anna Eshoo, or one of New York City’s Manhattan districts (NY-12) represented by Carolyn Maloney, the average tax cut could be as much as $3,000.\\nLower-income communities, such as areas near Phoenix, Arizona, (AZ-7) represented in the House by Ruben Gallego, as well as Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (PA-2), will see much larger percentage decreases in their tax bills. Tax reform benefited these communities by cutting their income taxes on average by 18 percent or more.\\nMoreover, Americans with children will benefit tremendously from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. A married couple filing jointly with two children will see their tax bills fall by $2,917.\\nThe tax cuts, however, will have much larger effects than just letting Americans keep more of their money. Since tax reform passed, more than 600 companies have announced more jobs, more bonuses, higher wages, charitable giving, and new investments in the U.S. Many of them explicitly cited the tax cuts as the reason for the bonuses and investments.\\nBusinesses are in the midst of the longest-running trend of adding jobs to the U.S. economy in our history.\\nIn the coming years, the tax cuts will continue to raise wages, increase investment, and expand economic opportunities. Americans will in fact benefit twice from the tax cuts—once from paying less in taxes, and again from higher pre-tax incomes.\\nBut this future is not certain. Many of the tax cuts expire after 2025, and some in Congress are determined to repeal them well before then. If the tax cuts are made permanent, our estimates suggest take-home pay after 2025 would be about 1 percent higher, corresponding to $600 per year for someone making the median U.S. income.\\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is fundamentally important for Americans all across the country. It’s time to protect our paychecks and our financial well-being by telling Congress to make our tax cuts permanent.',\n",

Now that the year 2020 is upon us, are any of these “doom and gloom” scenarios actually occurring?\\xa0Far from it.\\xa0 \\nIndeed, the planet has experienced a bit of lukewarming. However, claims of increases in extreme weather are vastly overstated. \\nIf anything, societies have been able to grow wealthier over time, and, as a result, have been more capable of weathering the extreme events that have come their way. \\nIn fact, here at home, the economy is thriving. Unemployment remains at historical lows.\\xa0And by achieving energy independence, we have transformed the global energy landscape. \\nSo where did all this alarmist rhetoric come from?\\xa0Well, faulty computer modeling is a big part of the explanation.\\xa0Computer models are sometimes based on assumptions that have been beefed up to satisfy a particular regulatory agenda.\\nThis is part of a new study I\\npublished in the peer-reviewed journal Environmental\\nEconomics and Policy Studies with Ross McKitrick of the University of\\nGuelph, Ontario, and Pat\\nMichaels of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a free-market think tank.\\xa0 \\nThe study examined some of the assumptions made in one model\\nused to estimate the economic effects of climate change. Called the FUND model, it is used to estimate a\\nconstruct known as the social cost of carbon, which refers to the economic\\ndamages associated with carbon dioxide emissions over a particular time\\nhorizon. \\xa0\\xa0\\nUnlike other models the government has used before, however,\\nthe FUND model actually incorporates benefits of carbon dioxide emissions into\\nits modeling.\\xa0 \\nAll of these computer models are based on assumptions. In\\nthis study, we focused on assumptions regarding climate\\nsensitivity as well as agricultural benefits. \\xa0\\nAlthough it long has been understood that carbon dioxide emissions affect temperatures, the question is to what degree (pun intended).\\xa0We found that updating these assumptions in line with more recent research can have a significant effect on the social cost of carbon.\\xa0\\xa0 \\nIn fact, under some realistic scenarios of moderate warming,\\nwe found that the social cost of carbon is essentially zero and might even be\\nnegative. That’s right: The benefits associated with a moderate amount of\\nwarming may outweigh the costs. Typically, such benefits result from longer\\ngrowing seasons and increased agricultural output.\\xa0\\xa0 \\nBottom line: The FUND model, under very reasonable assumptions, indicates that a moderate amount of warming has practically no negative impact and might even be a good thing.\\xa0 \\nThis study is just one of many in a stream of research on\\nthe social cost of carbon published by The Heritage Foundation’s Center for\\nData Analysis. My prior research with colleagues demonstrated that the computer\\nmodels used to estimate the economic impact of climate change are extremely\\nsensitive to reasonable changes in other assumptions as well. \\nThese assumptions include foolish attempts to make\\nprojections 300 years into the future and ignorance of recommendations\\nby the Office of Management and Budget regarding cost-benefit analysis.\\nIn our research, we varied these assumptions by altering the model’s projections in a more reasonable manner, incorporating the OMB’s recommendations for this type of analysis and updating assumptions regarding climate sensitivity.\\xa0 We found that tweaking these assumptions can reduce the social cost of carbon by as much as 80% or more compared to estimates made by the Obama administration. \\xa0\\nOur conclusion: The Obama administration deliberately beefed up estimates of the social cost of carbon to justify its policy agenda.\\xa0Ever since, Heritage has advocated that these computer models are so prone to user manipulation that it is not only naïve but dangerous to put them in the hands of lawmakers, regulators, and bureaucrats:\\n —Heritage’s analysis of the DICE model, also used to estimate the social cost of carbon. \\n —Heritage’s analysis of the FUND model.\\n —Heritage’s other peer-reviewed analysis of these computer models.\\nThis work has been recognized by Congress as well as both the Obama and Trump administrations.\\nYes, statistical models can be useful for understanding real-world phenomena.\\xa0\\nAny model, however, is only as a good as the assumptions from which it is composed.\\xa0Improperly specified models can deceive the public, misguide policymakers, and result in big costs for ordinary Americans.\\n>>> Related: How Faulty Assumptions in Climate Predictions Could Mean Big Costs for Americans',\n",

That’s equivalent to a credit card bill of\\n$178,000 for every household in America.\\nThis marks an enormous increase. Even after adjusting for inflation, it’s a jump of $60,000 over just 10 years for the average household. \\nIn other words, even after accounting for inflation, the U.S. added more debt per household over the past 10 years than it did over its first 200 years.\\nLow interest rates today make our debt seemingly manageable, but the higher America’s debt grows, the more likely it is that rates could suddenly spike, sending terrible shocks throughout the economy. \\nNow, an obscure\\npension “fix” could hasten such a shock by opening the door to massive pension bailouts\\nthat could push our $23 trillion debt closer to $30 trillion, or $230,000 per\\nhousehold.\\nUnbeknownst to\\nmost Americans, Congress is considering legislation to “fix” underfunded\\nprivate union pension plans that have promised at least $638\\nbillion more in pension\\nbenefits than they’ve set aside to pay. \\nThe “fix” that\\nmismanaged pension plans have lobbied Congress for is to shift those broken\\npromises onto taxpayers. Politicians who receive hefty donations from unions, along\\nwith some lawmakers who have lots of constituents that would benefit from a\\ntaxpayer bailout, are pushing for just that—a massive bailout without reform.\\nBecause the proposed bailouts do nothing to penalize plans for their\\npast recklessness and nothing to impose proper funding requirements going\\nforward, those plans’ unfunded obligations would only rise further. \\nBut this time, it\\nwould be on the taxpayers’ dime.\\nWorse, if Congress\\nbails out private union pension plans, how will it say no to teachers, police,\\nand firefighters who come to the federal government asking for a bailout of\\ntheir state and local pensions that have an estimated $4 trillion to $6 trillion in unfunded pension promises? \\nTacking as much as $6.7 trillion onto our national debt to cover broken pension promises would raise the average household’s debt burden by $52,000, to $230,000.\\nAnd that would come before Congress tackles Social Security’s $13.9 trillion shortfall that would require an additional $108,000 per household to fix. \\nAll told, the current deficit plus Social Security’s and private and public pension plans’ shortfalls would amount to about $338,000 in debt for the average household.\\nThat’s more than five times\\nthe median household’s income. \\xa0\\xa0\\nAmerica’s debt already threatens our freedom and prosperity. Unfairly forcing taxpayers to take on the broken pension promises of private and public sector unions would raise that threat level.\\nCongress should help\\nalleviate and prevent pension shortfalls—but not through taxpayer bailouts. \\nFirst, policymakers must tackle Social Security’s unfunded promises by updating the program and better focusing benefits on those who need them most.\\nDoing so would prevent massive tax increases—an additional $1,000 to $2,000 per year for middle-class households—on workers.\\nCongress should then address pension underfunding by maintaining the solvency of its pension insurance program and by enforcing proper funding rules to hold employers and unions liable for the benefits they promise.

Hermann Center for the Federal Budget, of the Institute for Economic Freedom, at The Heritage Foundation. Read her research.\\nImagine that a\\ncharge was brought against you and you had to appear in court. Now, imagine\\nthat instead of having the choices of representing yourself, hiring an attorney\\nof your choice, or being represented by a public defender, you were required to\\nuse an appointed public defender. \\nAnd now, imagine\\nthat the public defender assigned to you had polar-opposite political views\\nthan yours and that your voting and opinions were fully disclosed to that\\npublic defender. \\nThat’s the case today for employees in unionized workplaces. \\nEven if the workers have the option not to join the union (because they live in a right-to-work state or are a public employee), they nevertheless cannot be represented by anyone other than the union—including by themselves—in employee-employer relations. And their choice not to join the union is well-known to the union that is supposed to represent them.\\nThe Worker’s\\nChoice Act—introduced by Republican Reps. Dusty Johnson of South Dakota,\\nGreg Murphy of North Carolina, and Phil Roe of Tennessee—would change that by\\nending unions’ government-granted monopoly over employee-employer negotiations,\\notherwise known as exclusive representation.\\nInstead, workers would be free to negotiate directly with their employer or to choose a representative outside of the union. \\xa0\\nThis would be an\\nimportant step for worker freedom and flexibility—particularly for the\\nincreasing number of workers who do not have and do not want rigid jobs and inflexible\\nschedules. \\nAs it is today,\\neven if a worker in a unionized workplace doesn’t join the union, he or she\\ncannot negotiate an alternative work schedule or different compensation—such as\\nperformance-based pay—than what the union negotiates. \\nAnd if the nonunion employee has any disciplinary action taken against him or her, his or her only recourse is through the union, which is unlikely to provide the same support as it would to dues-paying union members.\\nIn essence, those\\nwho aren’t union members are forced to accept the terms and conditions of\\nemployment and representation by an organization that does not actually\\nrepresent those workers’ desires and which they may strongly oppose. \\nWhy would workers\\noppose the unions that are supposed to represent them?\\nFor starters, unions tend to negotiate rigid pay scales, schedules, and promotion pathways. While this worked well for factories in the 1930s, it’s not ideal for a more service-oriented labor market in which workers want flexibility and greater opportunities. \\nA young teacher\\nmay significantly outperform a colleague who is 20 years his or her senior, and\\nyet that young teacher will likely receive half the pay, be last in line to\\nchoose from new opportunities, and first in line to lose his or her job.\\nUnion-dictated\\npay scales also penalize high performers because unions set pay scales based on\\nseniority instead of employees’ performance.\\xa0\\n\\nWhen the Giant Eagle grocery store in Edinboro, Pennsylvania,\\ngave two dozen of its employees’ performance-based raises, the Local 23 union\\ntook Giant Eagle to court and forced the company to revoke those workers’ pay\\nraises. \\nEven though those raises were above the union-negotiated pay scale and did not reduce any other workers’ wages, the union said they violated its contract because the raises resulted in some junior workers receiving higher wages than some with longer tenure. \\nMost workers want\\nto be paid based on the work they perform, not just how long they have worked\\nfor a company. \\nAnother reason\\nsome workers oppose unions is that they often do not use members’ dues for the\\nbenefit of workers. \\nAccording to the Free to Teach organization, the Pennsylvania State Education Association teachers union spent 34% of its members’ dues on political activities in 2017, with those activities almost exclusively supporting Democratic politicians and liberal policies.\\xa0 \\nDisgracefully,\\nmembers’ dues sometimes go toward corrupt and illegal activities. \\nAccording to a compilation of federal data from Bob Gilson at FedSmith, 150\\nfederal union officials stole more than $4.5 million from members’ dues between\\n2001 and 2018, with the average convicted official having stolen more than\\n$30,000. \\xa0\\nCorruption isn’t\\nnew. The Teamsters union will soon end three decades of government oversight following its entanglement in the mob\\nand its use of members’ pension funds on things such as Las Vegas casino\\ninvestments. \\nNor has corruption\\ngone away. Recently, United Auto Workers’ union officials misused more than\\n$4.5 million of workers’ dues that were supposed to go toward improving\\nopportunities and education of employees. Instead, union officials spent those\\nfunds on personal luxuries such as “a $350,000 Ferrari, two $36,500 pens, hundreds of\\nthousands of dollars in private home improvements and mortgage payments, and a\\n$30,000 party that featured strolling models sparking attendees’ cigars.” \\nMeanwhile, the average General Motors Co. worker lost about $4,000 of wages during the recent United Auto Workers-led strike as the union pays less than minimum wage for strike pay. \\nFinally, many workers don’t support unions because those unions are hostile to anyone who does not support them. Such hostility can include showing up on workers’ doorsteps, inflicting damage to their property, and making threats against workers’—and their families’—lives. \\nRequiring workers\\nto be represented by an organization that could be openly antagonistic to them\\nis equivalent to stripping them of their right to be represented at all.\\nAnd on the other side, unions should not have to represent workers who do not support them by paying membership dues.

Andrew Cuomo compared the flexible work economy to \"sweatshops.\" (Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\\n\\nRachel Greszler\\n\\nRachel Greszler is research fellow in economics, budget, and entitlements in the Grover M. Hermann Center for the Federal Budget, of the Institute for Economic Freedom, at The Heritage Foundation. Read her research.\\nIn his State of the State address on Jan. 8, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo likened 21st-century gig-economy corporations to late 18th- and early 19th-century sweatshops, the latter characterized as such for their poor working conditions, exploitation of workers, and violations of labor laws. \\nBy asserting that entirely optional gig and contract-based work “is exploitive, abusive, it’s a scam, it’s a fraud,” Cuomo displayed a thorough lack of understanding of the gig economy and independent workers. \\nFor starters, there are no corporate factories in the gig economy, and aside from some more strenuous “task rabbit”-type jobs, very few gig workers break a sweat. \\n“Exploitive”? Independent work is entirely at will. Individuals choose what jobs they want to perform, what hours they want to work, and they have wide latitude in how to accomplish their jobs.\\n>>> California’s ‘Pro-Worker’ Law Is Killing Jobs Left and Right\\n“Abusive”? Sweatshops imposed harsh conditions on workers, even locking them in unsafe buildings and preventing them from leaving. The essence of independent work is that there is no factory or corporate job site. Independent workers use their own property, or they contract with a client to determine their job site. \\nA “scam”? Sweatshops often withheld workers’ wages, and some were even implicated in human trafficking scams. Most independent workers get paid more quickly than formal employees, who typically collect biweekly or semimonthly paychecks. \\nContractors typically get paid within a week of when their\\nwork is completed. Most temporary-help agencies pay weekly. Uber drivers get\\npaid every week, and Etsy sellers receive payment within one to three days of a\\nsale. Gig platforms typically provide payment records that can be easily\\naccessed from participants’ smartphones.\\nA “fraud”? There’s nothing fake, nor phony, about an estimated one out of every three workers in the U.S. participating in independent work, about the additional income and opportunities gig and contract work generates, about the value workers place on the flexibility and autonomy it provides, or about the convenience and value it delivers to individuals and families across the U.S. who purchase goods and services that would otherwise be inaccessible. \\nIt doesn’t appear that any of Cuomo’s disparaging adjectives apply to independent work in the modern economy. Nor does his likening it to sweatshops hold true.\\nAccording to the Department of Labor, the definition of a sweatshop is a factory that violates two or more U.S. labor laws. \\n>>> California’s Latest Act of Idiocy: Killing Freelance Work\\nThe gig economy and contract-based employment at-large aren’t violating any labor laws. It’s just that Cuomo, along with unions and the lawmakers they support, wants to make them illegal.\\nIn his address, Cuomo said of contract and gig-based employment that “it must stop, and it has to stop here and now.” \\nSuch calls to end gig and contract-based work are\\nfounded in the paternalistic presumption that workers are better off\\nworking for a boss than for themselves, and that politicians’ prescribed\\n“protections” are more beneficial than the autonomy\\nand flexibility independent workers value.\\nIndependent workers disagree. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, “Fewer than 1 in 10 independent contractors would prefer a traditional work arrangement.” And the average Uber driver wouldn’t work at all if they had to commit to a traditional taxicab employment arrangement.\\nThere are many reasons for those preferences, as independent\\nworkers represent a diverse group of individuals such as: \\nWiping out opportunities for all these workers in a\\nmisguided effort to provide “protections” to a minority of independent workers\\nwho lament not having formal employment arrangements is not the solution. \\nIf some customers who shop at Food Lion complain that it doesn’t provide all the organic products they want, the solution is for them to shop at Whole Foods instead. It’s not for the federal government to require that Food Lion replace its non-organic products with organic versions.\\nFortunately, in today’s strong labor market, with record low\\nunemployment and more job openings than there are people looking for jobs,\\nindividuals who are not content with gig-economy or contract-based jobs have\\nlots of opportunities for formal employment.\\nGovernment interventions that try to provide workers with\\nmore “protections”—such as those of Obamacare and other employer mandates that\\nkick in as companies employ more workers and provide them more hours—end up\\ncosting as much or more in lost jobs and incomes as they add in new\\n“protections.” \\xa0\\xa0\\nA better alternative than mandates is for independent workers\\nto join organizations, such as the Freelancers Union, that\\npool workers to offer lower-cost health and disability insurance that formal\\nemployment provides.\\nA New York politician once argued in favor of Uber: “[I]t’s offering a great service for people, and it’s giving people jobs. I don’t think government should be in the business of trying to restrict job growth.”\\nThat politician pointed out that “if you try to say we are going to cap your job growth here, they’ll go next door and grow their jobs.” \\nIronically, those statements came from Cuomo back in 2015, when he was criticizing New York Mayor Bill de Blasio for imposing limits on Uber.\\nCuomo was right when he\\ncharacterized Uber as “one of these great\\ninventions, startups, of this new economy,” but he is absurdly wrong when he\\nrefers to it and other gig-economy and contract jobs now as “sweatshops.”',\n",

With a median household income of just over $63,000,\\nthat’s clearly unsustainable. \\nAnd it’s not just the already-high debt,\\nit’s the risk that such high debt will cause a spike in interest rates, requiring\\ndrastic spending cuts at the same time as massive tax increases. According to\\nthe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, just a 1% increase in interest\\nrates would raise interest costs by $1.9 trillion over the next 10 years. On a per-household basis,\\nthat’s an extra $147,300 over 10 years.\\nBut 1% interest rate\\nincreases are mild compared to recent historical fiscal crises. In Greece,\\ninterest rates rose by about 8% from 2010 to 2011, and briefly\\nsurpassed 35% in 2012. In Puerto Rico, rates spiked as much as 2.5% in a single month. When governments can’t\\nborrow at reasonable rates, they face extremely limited choices. \\nIf U.S. policymakers\\ncontinue to spend without restraint and put off confronting out-of-control\\nentitlement program growth, modest reforms no longer will be possible.\\nAusterity will be the only option. \\nTake Greece, for example.\\nIts forced austerity measures of spending cuts and tax increases amounted to 40%\\nof gross domestic product and caused the economy to shrink by 25% and the\\nunemployment rate to rise to 27%. That austerity “saddled Greece with suffocatingly high taxes, deterring\\nbusiness activity and contributing to heavy emigration, especially of young and\\neducated people,” according to a\\nrecent Wall Street Journal article.\\nThat’s why the U.S.’ unsustainable debt is arguably one of America’s greatest threats. \\nFailure to address this now\\ncould mean that today’s generation of children could be the first to reverse\\nAmerica’s trend of upward economic movement and instead end up worse-off than\\ntheir parents.\\nBut that doesn’t have to be\\nthe case. \\nSolving our fiscal crisis is not easy, but it is possible and The Heritage Foundation has a plan that would balance the budget within 10 years, let workers keep more of their hard-earned dollars, and give individuals more control over their future. \\nAs Powell pointed out, putting the U.S. budget on a “sustainable path” would boost the growth and “vigor” of the U.S. economy and give policymakers the tools to provide stability in future downturns.',\n",

If they don’t, they’ll lose out to other\\nbusinesses that do adapt, and offer better products and lower prices as a\\nresult. \\nSimilarly, city and state governments that can’t or don’t adapt\\nwill lose residents and the economic output and tax revenues they take with\\nthem.\\nUnfortunately, high pension costs have hamstrung the ability\\nto adapt for many companies and state and local governments.\\nInstead of helping employers adapt so that their workers can\\nkeep their jobs, unions across the U.S. are blocking it, choosing instead to\\ntry to micromanage employers out of existence or into bankruptcy.\\nDefined benefit pensions are largely a relic of the past for private sector, nonunionized workers. But where unions exist, onerous pension costs are dragging down companies and state and local economies. \\nTake General Motors Co., for example. The United Auto Workers union recently led GM workers to a nearly six-week strike, costing the average GM factory worker about $4,000 in lost wages and resulting in nearly $4 billion in lost earnings for GM. \\nThe reason for the strike? A push for higher compensation,\\nincluding shifting temporary workers to high-cost, full-employee positions, and\\nan attempt to bring jobs back from Mexico to the U.S. Of course, higher\\ncompensation costs make it harder for GM to produce cars here, and ultimately,\\nthe union couldn’t stand up to the forces of globalization. \\nAlthough GM factory workers earn between\\n$17 and $30 per hour, the automaker’s total compensation costs of $63\\nper hour for those workers are more than double their pay. In large part,\\nthat’s due to extremely high pension costs. \\nInstead of pushing for even higher compensation costs, the\\nUAW should help reduce pension costs so that more workers can keep their jobs. While\\npension benefits are important to employees, most would be willing to accept a\\nslightly less generous pension if it prevented tens of thousands of fellow\\nemployees from losing their jobs.\\xa0 \\nExtravagant Teacher Pensions\\nAnother pension-plagued strike is the one that just ended in\\nChicago, where teachers went on strike for 11 days. In addition to lost\\neducation, families lost income and work days as they grappled with either\\nstaying home or finding child care. \\nAlthough wages were the big sticking point in the negotiations—the union wanted the 16% pay increase that the city proposed to occur over five years to instead accrue over three years—pension costs limit possible pay raises.\\nThat’s because in addition to being among the highest-paid\\nteachers in the nation, with a median salary of $75,000\\nthat would rise to nearly $100,000 over five years under the mayor’s\\nproposal, Chicago teachers enjoy extremely generous pension benefits. A teacher\\nwith a 30-year career receives a $76,500\\npension for life.\\nBut because past politicians and unions who promised\\ngenerous pension benefits failed to negotiate and put aside the funds to pay\\nthose benefits, Chicago is not only making pension contributions for current\\nteachers but also paying the unfunded costs of retired teachers’ pensions. \\nBecause of its sorry state, Chicago’s public school system\\nhas a junk\\nbond rating, below even that of Detroit.\\nAnd the city’s debt already is driving out residents and businesses. \\nChicago is the only city among the top 10 metropolitan areas\\nin the U.S. to have lost\\npopulation in each of the past four years. And enrollment in public schools\\nis down almost 12% over the past decade. \\xa0\\xa0\\nPerhaps that’s because high pension costs are chipping away\\nat other government services and requiring significant tax increases. \\nAlready, Chicago residents have\\nexperienced a $1.1 billion property tax hike, a 29.5% tax on water and sewage\\nbills, and a 100% increase in a telephone tax, among others, to pay for the\\ncity’s generous pension promises. If the teachers union had gotten its\\nway, property taxes would have increased by more than $220\\nper year.\\nThere’s no fair way to erase these pension costs, but there\\nare ways to minimize the consequences. For starters, the Chicago teachers union\\nshould allow modest reforms to its pension system. \\nAccording to an economic analysis, Illinois teachers valued additional pension benefits at only 20 cents on the dollar, yet the city of Chicago is contributing 27% of teachers’ salaries—about $20,000 per teacher—to the pension system. That means that pension reforms could save taxpayers money and provide teachers with the pay increases they want. \\nA Bankrupt Coal\\nCompany\\nFinally, we have the just-declared\\nbankruptcy of the largest coal company in the U.S., Murray Energy Corp. \\nCoal bankruptcies are nothing new, and Obama-era regulations\\nfurther exacerbated the industry’s decline. But most people don’t realize the\\ntoll that unfunded pension costs have taken on the coal industry. \\nMurray Energy was by far the largest remaining coal company\\ncontributing to the pension fund of the United Mine Workers of America. Although\\nmost coal production in the U.S. no longer is unionized, Murray Energy had a\\nsignificant number of UMWA employees for whom it was paying extremely high\\npension costs.\\nAccording to a 2016\\nhearing in the U.S. Senate, pension costs were about $2 per hour for every\\nemployee in the plan in 2007, compared to about $6 in 2016.\\nData from the union’s most recent financial filing, for\\n2017, suggests that Murray Energy may have been paying tens of thousands of\\ndollars per year in pension contributions on behalf of each of its roughly\\n2,000 employees. \\nEmployer contributions totaled $112 million, and if Murray\\nEnergy accounted for roughly 60% of the plan’s 3,500 participants, it would\\nhave paid $67 million, or $33,000 per worker. \\nAnd the sad reality is that current UMWA workers will\\nreceive little—if any—of those five-figure pension contributions because the union’s\\nplan will be insolvent within three years.\\nIt’s hard to compete with nonunionized coal companies that likely\\npay a couple of thousand dollars per year into their workers’ 401(k)s. \\nThe Solution\\nSo if high pension costs are dragging down companies and\\ngovernments, but those pension costs are compensation that employees earned, what’s\\nthe solution? \\nLong term, the solution is to transition to defined\\ncontribution 401(k) retirement accounts. If employers and governments\\ncontribute directly into workers accounts, they can’t short-change their employees\\nand the contributions cannot be used to finance other government spending. \\nAnd if workers own their retirement benefits, they know how\\nmuch money they have and no one can take that money away from them. \\nIn the short term, grappling with $638 billion worth of\\nunfunded private union pension promises and between $4 trillion and $6 trillion\\nin unfunded state and local pensions will be no easy task. But there are reasonable\\nsolutions. \\nEmployers and lawmakers need to be held accountable to properly fund the promises they make, and employers should be allowed to reform their benefit structures to minimize losses for employees and retirees.',\n",
       " 'At a hearing, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, pictured at an event in November, said the government should require at least eight weeks of paid maternity leave because puppies get eight weeks with their dog mothers.(Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\\n\\nRachel Greszler\\n\\nRachel Greszler is research fellow in economics, budget, and entitlements in the Grover M. Hermann Center for the Federal Budget, of the Institute for Economic Freedom, at The Heritage Foundation. Read her research.\\nAs a woman who gave birth to six children and is\\nraising them, I find being compared to a breeding dog incredibly offensive. \\nEarlier this week at a hearing held by the House Oversight and Reform Committee, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said the government should require at least eight weeks of paid maternity leave because puppies get eight weeks with their dog mothers.\\nOur research fellow Rachel Greszler—a mother of six—shared solutions to increase access to #paidfamilyleave.@AOC responded by ignoring her research and comparing new mothers to breeding dogs. pic.twitter.com/MgX6BvpxRJ\\nI hope that before Ocasio-Cortez uses this comparison\\nagain, she will consider how insulting it is. \\nIt’s also a terrible comparison, considering that puppies are taken from their mothers and sold after eight weeks (most states require an eight-week period for vaccination purposes). These puppies also never get to meet their fathers.\\nBut let’s consider the more serious matter of how we\\ncan help families who don’t have access to paid family leave. \\nIn the hearing, Ocasio-Cortez presented misleading\\ndata, failed to recognize basic economic principles, and ignored the evidence\\nof government-provided paid family leave programs across the world.\\nOcasio-Cortez and others claimed that 80% of workers don’t\\nhave access to paid family leave. That’s at best a half-truth. The 80% figure only\\nincludes workers who do not have access to formal paid family and medical leave policies\\nthat cover parental leave, personal medical leave, and family care leave. \\n>>> Problematic Women: Why Government-Funded Maternity Leave Is Not the Answer\\nMost\\nworkers who take paid family leave do not use a formal paid\\nfamily leave policy, but rather a combination of vacation, sick leave, and\\nother paid time off. In addition, 47%\\nof full-time private-sector workers have access to employer-provided short-term\\ndisability insurance policies covering maternity leave and their own medical\\nleave. \\nAlso, many workers have access to state-based paid\\nfamily leave programs. The eight states and the District of Columbia that have\\nenacted state-based paid family leave programs account for 29% of all U.S. workers.\\n\\nThen, there are the basic economics of paid family\\nleave. \\nThe\\nMarket Is Providing What Workers Want\\nWorkers want paid family leave. Employers want to be able to provide it because it helps them attract employees and keep them on board. \\nA strong economy and tight labor market are doing more for workers than any government paid family leave program ever could. With more job openings than there are workers available to fill them, employers have to compete to attract and retain the workers they need by offering higher wages and more benefits.\\nAnd when employers can keep more of the money they\\nearn and don’t have to waste resources on costly and unhelpful regulations,\\nthey can devote more resources to the pay and benefits workers want.\\nFinally, when workers have higher wage growth and can\\nkeep more of the money they earn, they are better able to afford taking leave\\nfrom work.\\nThat’s why the combination of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and fewer unnecessary regulations have been so helpful in improving workers’ ability to take paid leave. The tax cuts put $1,400 per year back into the typical American household’s pocketbook, spurred companies to provide more paid family leave, produced wage gains of about $1,500 last year for workers making less than $25,000, and lowered the unemployment rate to a 50-year record low.\\nBut despite all the benefits of paid family leave, we\\ncannot ignore that it has costs and consequences. A government-run paid family\\nleave program cannot erase those costs—it can only redistribute them.\\nThe\\nAOC-Backed Bill\\nThe FAMILY Act, which members like Ocasio-Cortez are proposing, purports that it would only cost workers a cup of coffee a week, but it would end up costing a tank of gas instead. \\nAs structured, the bill could provide 12 weeks of paid\\nleave to only a fraction of workers who want to take it. \\nIt’s simple math: If you collect $200 in taxes from\\nthe typical worker and provide an average benefit of $7,600 over 12 weeks, then\\nfewer than 3% of workers can take leave in a given year. \\nBut about 16% of workers take leave. That leaves a big\\ngap between who wants to take leave and who would be able to take it.\\nUnless the government implements a rationed paid\\nfamily leave policy, it will have to collect drastically more in taxes than it\\nclaims—closer to $1,500\\nfor the average worker. \\nThose costs would hurt low-income workers the most.\\nAnd this is the third point Ocasio-Cortez failed to\\nrecognize. \\nRedistributing\\nFrom the Poor to the Rich\\nAcross the world, government-run paid family leave policies are regressive, taxing everyone and redistributing that money away from low-income earners to middle- and upper-income ones. \\nHow can we increase access to #paidfamilyleave? Rachel Greszler offered insights and solutions—and explained why a federal program would be worse than the programs many workers have today. pic.twitter.com/KzgPL5vnux\\nThere are a number of reasons for that, including low\\nawareness among lower-income earners, and the fact that partial government\\nbenefits just aren’t enough—someone making $600 a week ($15/hour) can’t get by\\non a $396 government-provided paid family leave check.\\nConsider the evidence:\\nAnd attempts to reverse these failures have failed. San\\nFrancisco enacted 100% benefits for many workers, and still,\\nlow-income mothers were only half as likely to receive government-provided\\nbenefits as high-income mothers.\\xa0 \\nMoreover, a recent economic analysis of California’s\\nprogram found that it reduced\\nwomen’s employment and earnings, as well as their\\nfertility rates. And European-sized policies have hurt women’s career\\nprospects and their wages.\\nWell-intended policies like these too often produce\\nnegative results. \\nLet\\nEmployers and Workers Stay Flexible\\nMost American families are best served by flexible,\\ntargeted approaches that meet their individual needs through voluntary\\nemployer-provided benefits, personal savings, and family supports. \\nPolicymakers should work to increase access to paid\\nfamily leave through policies that help employers have the resources to provide\\nthese benefits, and that give workers more\\nincome and flexibility to choose what is best for them. \\nThe last thing our country needs is another unaffordable\\nand poorly targeted national entitlement program that fails to meet the real\\nneeds of workers.

Hermann Center for the Federal Budget, of the Institute for Economic Freedom, at The Heritage Foundation. Read her research.\\nIf you want less of something, raise its price. That’s\\nthe logic behind policies such as cigarette and soda taxes and plastic bag fees.\\nSomehow, policymakers in California thought that by\\nraising the cost of doing business with independent workers, they could make\\nall those workers better off.\\nBut now, instead of higher benefits and improved job\\nprotections, many independent workers are losing\\ntheir jobs, along with the flexibility and autonomy they value.\\nIn September, the California legislature passed, and Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law, AB 5—a bill that upends the gig economy and contract-based employment in California. \\nWith a little more than 10% of workers engaged in independent work as their primary job and as many as 1 in 3 workers participating in independent work on some level, California’s law could affect anywhere from 1 million to 5 million workers (not including its inconsistent exemptions).\\xa0\\xa0 \\nBy applying a three-part “ABC” test that forces companies to treat many individuals they simply do business or contract with as formal employees, the California law is causing havoc for many companies and, particularly, for independent workers—at least those that didn’t receive a special exemption under the law.\\n>>> California’s Disastrous State Illustrates Limits of Progressivism\\nSmall employers will be hardest hit because they rely\\nmore heavily on contractors. Businesses that have four or fewer employees use\\n6.7 contractors, on average. \\nImagine a small landscape company that has three\\nemployees and contracts with a half-dozen others for services such as tree\\nremoval, stonework, or sprinkler installation. \\nUnder the new law, those contract workers would have to become formal employees, meaning the owner would be in charge of the work they perform (even though he is not an expert in their services) and how many hours they work and would have to provide them with employee benefits. \\nSince that’s probably not feasible or advantageous, the\\nowner would instead have to cut ties with those contractors and stop offering\\ntheir services. That will make it harder for him to compete with bigger\\ncompanies who can fully and formally employ more specialized workers.\\nEven if big companies, such as Uber, might be able to\\nremain profitable by treating workers as employees, drivers and customers will\\npay a price. \\nUber is challenging the law in court, but if it and other gig platforms can’t negotiate or litigate their way out of AB 5, they presumably will have to take away the autonomy and flexibility that draw workers to the gig economy. \\nFor ride-share companies, drivers likely would be assigned prescribed shifts and locations, they could be required to pick up certain passengers, they would need to request time off in advance, and they might be forced to work exclusively for one company.\\nThese companies could also decide that the increased liability of formal employment means they need to monitor workers by video to ensure control over their employees’ workplaces and performance. \\nAnd gig economy customers can count on steep price hikes, which will reduce demand and lead to even fewer jobs and services.\\nIndependent truck drivers also are hit hard by the law. According to the California Trucking Association, which filed a lawsuit against the state in November, AB 5 will put 70,000 owner-operator truckers out of work. \\nIndependent\\ntruckers such as Brian Gray already have packed up their\\nfamilies and moved out of California, and may others, such as Jeff and Elyse\\nFink, are narrowing their relocation options. \\n“As of Jan. 1, I was told the\\ncompany can’t dispatch me with loads leaving California if we still want to\\nwork for the company,” Jeff\\nFink said. \\nThese drivers don’t want to leave the state, but\\nthey’ve invested in their trucks, and those investments won’t pay off under the\\nlaw as written. Fortunately, this group was granted at least a temporary\\nreprieve on Dec. 31, when a federal judge issued a temporary\\nrestraining order against the law’s application to\\nindependent truckers. \\nA hearing considering a permanent injunction for\\ntruckers is set for Jan. 13.\\nFreelance writers and photographers also are suing California over AB 5; the Pacific Legal Foundation is representing them in their argument that the law unconstitutionally restricts free speech and media. \\nThe groups also argue that the law’s unequal application deprives certain groups of equal representation. For example, juice drivers, journalists, and photographers are subject to AB 5, but milk drivers, grant writers, and fine artists are exempt. \\nThey also argue that AB 5 strips freelancers of their ownership rights, because formal employment usually requires these professionals to give ownership of their work over to their employer.\\nThe law should be applied equally. Laws that\\nnecessitate frequent exemptions and lead to numerous lawsuits are undemocratic\\nand destructive.\\nIf California lawmakers want to help independent workers, they should restore the flexibility and opportunity workers sought when they entered the gig economy. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, fewer than 1 in 10 independent contractors would prefer a traditional work arrangement. These workers want this arrangement. They don’t want to be “protected” from it. \\nMany of these independent workers are single parents, individuals with disabilities, and women, who tend to want and need more flexibility and autonomy than traditional employment provides.\\nYet, California policymakers seem intent on having\\neveryone answer to a boss—one who will determine their schedule, monitor the\\nwork they perform, and control how much income they can earn.

In total, the Pension Benefit\\nGuaranty Corporation estimates that multiemployer plans have $638\\nbillion in unfunded pension promises.\\xa0 \\nThe United Mine Workers covers fewer than 1% of multiemployer pension recipients, and its roughly $6 billion in underfunding is only the tip of the iceberg. \\nThe Central States Teamsters pension plan has about $44 billion\\xa0in unfunded pension promises, with the roughly five dozen other Teamsters-associated pensions plans adding even more.\\nWhile these two plans have drawn significant attention and consideration for taxpayer bailouts, they represent only a small fraction of all multiemployer pension plans, workers, and retirees. \\nIt’s wrong that employers and unions were allowed to make promises without properly funding them, and it’s unfair that nearly 100,000 coal miners, 1.4 million Teamsters members, and more than 9 million other workers and retirees with private union pensions across the U.S. stand to lose a significant portion of their pension benefits through no fault of their own. \\nBut taxpayers had no role in these broken pension promises, and despite the United Mine Workers’ claim, the federal government did not make a promise to coal miners. \\nThe solution to the multiemployer pension crisis is not to bail out just one of more than 1,300 massively underfunded union pension plans without doing anything to improve the system. \\nThat would either create huge inequities—with mine workers receiving 100% of promised benefits, while others receive mere pennies on the dollar—or else it would set the stage for a massive taxpayer bailout of numerous other private and public pensions.\\nIf Congress\\nopens the door to pension bailouts—including $638\\nbillion in private union pensions and up to $6 trillion in state and local pensions—the price tag could reach $52,000 for every household in the U.S. \\nCongress\\nneeds to change the rules so that this never happens again, to maintain the\\nPension Benefit Guaranty Corporation solvency as a pension safety net, and to require\\nplans to act sooner, rather than later, to minimize pension losses.\\nInstead\\nof tying a selective bailout for just one union pension plan onto an\\nend-of-the-year spending bill, Congress should provide a comprehensive solution\\nto the multiemployer pension crisis—one that doesn’t just shift the bill to\\ntaxpayers and one that doesn’t leave 99 out of 100 pensioners in the\\nlurch.\\xa0 \\xa0\",\n",

The first component would contain about $35 billion in loan costs. \\nUnder the bill, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that a new pension rehabilitation administration would provide $39.7 billion in loans, of which taxpayers would recoup only $7.4 billion in interest and loan repayments.

The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the Central States Pension Fund would receive $3 billion in direct cash in 2020 alone. \\nAlthough the bill includes some offsetting revenues, or “pay fors,” all but about $6 billion of that revenue is unrelated to the bill’s purpose, and some of those revenues have already been claimed by bills the House previously passed.\\nThe bill’s total cost of $100 billion—the equivalent of a new $600 tax on every worker in the U.S.—is a huge sum of money, particularly for a Band-Aid solution. \\nIn a Sept. 6 letter from the Congressional Budget Office to the Senate Budget Committee, the agency noted that even if more than $100 billion in taxpayer funds were given to a select group of pension plans, only a small portion of those plans could repay their loans, and most plans receiving assistance would still become insolvent. \\nThe letter states:\\nAbout one-quarter of the affected pension plans would become insolvent in the 30-year loan period and would not fully repay their loans. … Most of the other plans would become insolvent in the decade following their repayment of their loans.\\nBut even that\\ncostly and ineffective assessment only scratches the surface of the pervasive\\nmultiemployer pension crisis. That’s because only 139 pension plans would be\\neligible for taxpayer assistance.\\nAccording to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, there are 1,374 multiemployer, or union, pension plans across the U.S., meaning only about 10% of them would qualify for assistance under this bill. \\nYet, a whopping 96% of multiemployer pension plans are less than 60% funded, and collectively, they are on track to be able to pay out only 42 cents of every dollar in promised benefits. \\nWhile the proposed\\npension bailout reduces apparent costs by limiting assistance to only a small\\nportion of the most deeply troubled plans—those considered critical and\\ndeclining in 2019—it leaves hundreds of other multiemployer plans that will\\nbecome insolvent at later dates looming for subsequent bailouts by future Congresses.\\n\\nIf policymakers\\nare going to provide a taxpayer bailout, the least they could do is fix the\\nproblems that led to employers and unions promising $638 billion more than they\\nset aside to pay workers. \\nBut instead of improving the solvency of plans and preventing future underfunding, the bill would incentivize plans to become even more underfunded so that they could push their broken promises onto taxpayers. \\nThe Congressional Budget Office notes the incentives of the bill, such as plans changing their discount-rate assumptions in order to qualify for taxpayer assistance. \\nAnd it’s unlikely that future Congresses would withhold assistance from plans that become insolvent after the bill’s enactment, because excluded plans would argue that’s “unfair.”\\nThus, the roughly\\n1,200 plans that wouldn’t initially qualify for assistance would nevertheless anticipate\\na future bailout and continue to promise benefits without setting aside the\\nfunds to pay them. \\nTreating all\\nmultiemployer pension plans equally could lead to a taxpayer bailout in excess\\nof $638 billion for private-sector pensions and an\\nadditional $4 trillion to $6 trillion for state and local pensions.\\nAt a cost of $30,000\\nto $42,000 per worker, that’s more than many Gen-Xers and millennials have set\\naside for their own retirement.\\xa0 \\nIn short, this is\\na terrible deal for taxpayers, and it’s no good for pensioners—particularly\\nyounger ones—who will still end up with insolvent pension plans. \\nBut it’s great\\nfor unions and employers who wouldn’t have to pay for their broken pension\\npromises and could instead walk away with a lobbying victory to report to their\\ndues-paying union members. \\nA bailout without reform is no solution and would only make problems worse. \\nInstead, Congress should enact these 12 reforms to protect workers and retirees without forcing taxpayers to pay for private union pensions’ broken promises—and without setting a precedent for federal bailouts of nonunion private pensions and state and local pensions.',\n",
       " 'November saw very little change in the U.S. labor market, according to a new employment report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\\nEmployers added a net 178,000 new jobs while the unemployment rate dropped. However, unemployment fell in large measure due to a continued drop in labor force participation. The economy largely continued on its current trajectory.\\nThe November household survey reported mixed results. Headline numbers show the unemployment rate fell by 0.3 percentage points down to 4.6 percent—a large and statistically significant drop. However, the employment-to-population ratio (that is, the proportion of the adult population with jobs) remained unchanged.\\nUnemployment fell primarily because labor force participation continued to decline, dropping to 62.7 percent. Americans who aren’t looking for work do not count as unemployed. So when Americans leave the labor force, this mechanically decreases the unemployment rate—even if hiring does not improve.\\nDemographic changes, such as the aging and retirement of the baby boomers, can only explain one part of the ongoing exodus from the labor force.\\nAmong younger “prime age” workers (25-54 years old) labor force participation fell more than it did across the entire adult population. It appears that the labor market is weaker than the headline unemployment rate suggests.\\nInterestingly, the largest drop in labor force participation in November occurred among the college-educated. Their labor force participation rate dropped 0.4 percentage points.\\nLabor force participation rates did not change at all for workers with a high school education or some college. This could reflect a real change in the labor prospects of more educated Americans, though it could also just be statistical noise.\\nThe household survey presented other modestly good news. The long-term unemployment rate dropped, and the average duration of unemployment fell by almost a week. This could be a positive sign.\\nUnfortunately, the Bureau of Labor Statistics report does not identify whether those who have been long-term unemployed found jobs or stopped looking for work altogether. So falling long-term unemployment may simply represent the long-term unemployed giving up on finding work.\\nThe payroll survey showed modest gains across several industries. The professional and business services (+63,000), health care and social assistance (+35,000), leisure and hospitality (+29,000), and government (+22,000) sectors accounted for the vast majority of November’s net employment growth.\\nThe payroll survey also showed average hourly earnings falling by 3 cents last month. That change probably represents statistical noise, not an actual drop in wages.\\nMeasured hourly wages rose considerably between August and October. Part of that increase was probably statistical fluctuations that\\xa0did not occur in the November report. Over the past year, average hourly earnings have grown 2.5 percent—well above the roughly 1 percent rise in inflation over that period.\\nThe labor market continues to grow at a modest pace. The economy appears to be neither shifting into high gear nor falling into a recession. For the many workers hurt by the Great Recession, there could be worse news. But the recovery they’ve long been waiting for still has yet to come.',\n",
       " 'On Wednesday, President Barack Obama took an economic victory lap in Elkhart, Indiana. The\\xa0Bureau of Labor Statistics’ employment report, which came out Friday, shows he was far too optimistic.\\nBoth the household and payroll surveys showed employment growth slowing to a crawl in May, while hundreds of thousands of Americans stopped looking for work. Seven years after the recession officially ended, the economy is not out of the woods.\\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics has two principal employment surveys: the household survey (which interviews workers) and the payroll survey (which interviews businesses). Both showed tepid job growth in May.\\nThe payroll survey reported employers created just 38,000 net new jobs last month. Almost all this growth occurred in the health care sector (+46,000) and government (+13,000). Most other sectors showed slight gains or experienced job losses. Worryingly, temporary help service employment contracted by 21,000 jobs.\\nTemporary jobs are often a leading indicator of future hiring patterns: employers typically cut back on temporary employees before letting regular staff go. Additional payroll survey data also showed employers created 59,000 fewer jobs than previously estimated in March and April.\\nThe household survey showed even slower job growth (+26,000), although the difference between the two surveys was not statistically significant. If this hiring rate continues, job creation will not keep pace with population growth and unemployment will rise.\\nNonetheless, the household survey reported the unemployment rate fell significantly, from 5 percent to 4.7 percent.\\nThis was not good news; it happened because the number of Americans outside the labor force jumped by 664,000 in May. The government does not count people not looking for work as unemployed. Their exit caused the labor force participation rate to drop 0.2 percentage points, and pushed down the unemployment rate.\\nBut the overall employment-to-population ratio—the proportion of the population with jobs—did not improve at all. The May drop in labor force participation, coming on top of the decrease in April, entirely erased the gains in labor force participation that occurred in the first quarter of 2016.\\nEconomists had expected some of this decline. Demographers long forecast labor force participation would fall as the baby boomers began to retire. But labor force participation fell for younger workers too. The labor force participation rate for so-called prime age workers (25 to 54 years old) also dropped by 0.2 percentage points.\\nInterestingly, the entire drop in participation for workers 25 and older occurred among Americans without a high school degree. Labor force participation rose slightly for workers with at least a high school education, or more.\\nMore discouraging news came from part-time employment. The number of Americans employed part-time for economic reasons jumped by almost 500,000. In May, many more workers who wanted full-time hours could not find them.\\nThe only bright spot in the report came in wage growth. Average hourly earnings increased 5 cents in May and have risen 2.5 percent over the past year. Since inflation has grown just 1.1 percent over that period, real wages have grown roughly 1.4 percent in the past 12 months. That represents solid growth by historical standards. But it may not last if the labor market weakens.\\nObama has overseen the weakest recovery of the post-war era, and this\\xa0jobs report illustrates just how fragile this recovery has been.',\n",
       " 'Juggling work and family life is hard. On Wednesday the Labor Department made it even harder for millions of salaried workers. The administration’s new overtime regulations will effectively turn them into hourly employees.\\nThe regulation won’t increase their earnings, but it will greatly reduce their control over their schedules. The Fair Labor Standards Act requires employers to pay hourly workers overtime for working over 40 hours a week.\\nBut the Fair Labor Standards Act regulations exempt many salaried employees. This makes sense: Salaried employees get paid to do a particular job, not work particular hours. They also generally have more control over when and where they work.\\nMany salaried employees have the flexibility to do things like take off early in the afternoon to attend a child’s soccer game, and then finish their work from home in the evening when their child has gone to sleep. Similarly, millions of salaried employees telecommute at least once a month.\\nThe Labor Department just restricted this flexibility.\\nOn Wednesday it raised the overtime “threshold” test for salaried employees to $47,500 a year. All salaried employees making less than that—no matter how advanced their job duties—now qualify for overtime. Their employers must pay time and a half when they work more than 40 hours a week.\\nOn the surface this seems appealing. Why shouldn’t workers get extra pay for working longer hours? However, economic research shows that is unlikely to happen. Most employers respond to overtime laws by reducing base pay an offsetting amount. Combining new overtime pay and lower salaries, most workers will earn almost exactly what they made before.\\nThis is what happened when IBM reclassified 7,000 salaried and technical-support workers as overtime-eligible in a lawsuit settlement. It also cut their base pay by 15 percent, leaving total earnings unaffected. Even liberal supporters of the rule concede that the “wage offer reflects expected overtime hours” and so there will be “no change at the margin” in pay.\\nThe rule will change how employees work. Overtime-eligible salaried employees must carefully log their hours. Each time they respond to a work e-mail, take a work phone call, or do any other work from home, their employer must track and pay them for it. If they do not, they risk getting sued. Trial lawyers filed 8,800 Fair Labor Standards Act lawsuits in 2015, many of them for employers who did not compensate overtime-eligible employees for work done remotely.\\nIn order to avoid lawsuits, many employers deny flexible work arrangements to overtime-eligible employees. Virtually all employers who permit remote work and flexible work arrangements allow overtime-exempt employees to use them.\\nOnly about half allow workers covered by overtime regulations to do so. As the head of human resources for Pitney Bowes explained to reporters, the company turned down requests from overtime-eligible staff to work from home because: “You just don’t take the [legal] risk.”\\nThe Labor Department says this regulation will help workers. It is much more likely to make balancing work and family even more difficult.',\n",
       " 'The labor market didn’t change much in October, according to today’s Bureau of Labor Statistics employment report.\\nUnemployment and job creation have remained steady over 2016. Those trends continued last month.\\nThe household survey reported that unemployment fell by 0.1 percentage points, to 5.0 percent. However, this drop primarily occurred because over 400,000 Americans left the labor force. (Americans who aren’t looking for work do not count as unemployed.)\\nConsequently, labor force participation also dropped 0.1 percentage points, to 62.8 percent.\\nThis small movement is almost certainly statistical noise. In September, unemployment and labor force participation rose slightly. The October numbers reversed those shifts, bringing both the unemployment rate and labor force participation rate back to their August level.\\nThe labor market has not changed much over the past several months.\\nThe payroll survey tells a similar story. It found that employers created 161,000 net new jobs in October—close to the average rate of job growth over 2016.\\nThe payroll survey found all net job creation occurred in the service sector, primarily professional and business services (plus 43,000), health care (plus 31,000), and government (plus 19,000). In October, the goods producing sector added no net jobs.\\nThe hourly earnings figures of the payroll survey were the best news in the jobs report. Average earnings rose 10 cents in October, to $25.92 an hour. Over the past year, average hourly earnings have risen 2.8 percent—considerably faster than inflation (approximately 1 percent). Workers’ earnings have improved measurably over the past year.\\nNonetheless, some of the wounds from the recession have yet to heal. The average unemployed American has been without work for over six months (27.2 weeks).\\nThat figure has scarcely changed over the past year. While more Americans have jobs, many without them still find getting work very difficult.\\nThe October jobs report shows no sign of another recession. But it also shows little sign of an accelerating recovery, either.',\n",
       " 'The Aviation Innovation Reform and Reauthorization Act contains several reforms that move in the right direction. Notably, it removes America’s air traffic control system from the Federal Aviation Administration and establishes it as a federally chartered, nonprofit corporation.\\nBut the legislation includes troubling labor provisions. Its supporters seem intent on buying government union support by giving them even more leverage over the public than they now possess.\\nThis sets a terrible precedent for future privatization efforts. Congress should modernize America’s air traffic control system without enriching unions.\\nThe\\xa0air traffic control system is unquestionably outdated. The government still uses 1960s technology to track planes in the air. Other countries, such as Canada, have solved this problem by privatizing their air traffic control systems.\\nThese private entities have rapidly switched to more reliable modern technologies that reduce the risk of collision. It is promising that members of Congress have acknowledged the benefits of privatizing air traffic control and have proposed to remove it from federal control, as Canada has.\\nHowever, the Aviation Innovation Reform and Reauthorization Act (AIRR) does not address one of the problems impeding reform: the National Association of Air Traffic Controllers, the union representing air-traffic controllers. The union\\xa0has used its leverage to negotiate gold-plated and diamond-studded compensation packages for its members.\\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics reports the median air traffic controller makes $123,000 a year in cash wages. Including noncash benefits brings the average total compensation package to approximately $200,000 a year—vastly more than most private-sector workers in jobs requiring an associate’s degree.\\nThe public pays for these inflated compensation packages through higher taxes on airline passengers. The National Association of Air Traffic Controllers redistributes wealth from taxpayers and the flying public—most of whom make much less than $200,000 a year – to the union’s members.\\nThe “reform” measure\\xa0does nothing to stop this. Worse, it includes several provisions that strengthen the union’s\\xa0hand:\\nCongress could easily fix these problems. Leaving the current dispute reconciliation system in place—instead of shifting to arbitration—would eliminate most of the labor concerns. The rest would be solved by expressly authorizing the new corporation to fire illegally striking workers—as the federal government can do now.\\nThese changes would enable the new agency to keep labor costs in line. But\\xa0the\\xa0Aviation Innovation Reform and Reauthorization Act does not take these steps, and instead increases\\xa0the union’s\\xa0leverage. Why?\\nProbably because AIRR supporters want the National Association of Air Traffic Controllers to support the reforms. They appear to have bought this support by offering the union\\xa0even more power at the quasi-private agency.\\nUnsurprisingly, the union\\xa0has endorsed the legislation. But this legislative payoff sets a terrible precedent for future privatization efforts. A non-trivial portion of the financial benefits of privatization come from eliminating the monopoly power of government unions. AIRR\\xa0\\xa0instead strengthens that monopoly power. This would set an expectation that future federal privatization efforts would similarly benefit unions.\\nPrivatizing the air traffic control system is long overdue. But Congress should not strengthen the union’s\\xa0power over the flying public in the process.',\n",
       " 'The new jobs report shows employers cranked up hiring in June, creating 287,000 net new jobs. But the last jobs report, for May, showed the economy slowing to a crawl, with employers adding only 11,000 net new jobs in the month.\\nWhat explains these large gyrations? Probably statistical noise. \\xa0Americans shouldn’t read too much into May’s discouraging job numbers or June’s hopeful ones.\\nBoth the payroll survey (which estimates job growth) and the household survey (which estimates the unemployment rate) are large-scale surveys. Like any survey, they have a margin of error.\\nNine times out of 10, the payroll survey estimate is within plus or minus 115,000 jobs of the actual job growth rate. Similarly, the household survey is within plus or minus 0.2 percentage points of the true unemployment rate 90 percent of the time.\\nConsequently, statistical noise can cause the household and payroll surveys to fluctuate considerably month to month, even if job growth and unemployment do not change. And 10 percent of the time, the surveys will report estimates outside this confidence interval.\\nThis statistical noise appears to explain the recent whiplash. Job growth plunged in May and rebounded in June. However, the average across both months was plus 149,000 jobs—very close to average job growth in March and April (plus 165,000 jobs).\\nMany measures of labor market health showed this pattern: dropping in May and rebounding in June.\\nFor example, the labor force participation rate for 25- to 54-year-olds fell 0.2 points in May. It then increased 0.2 points in June. That increase simply returned the participation rate to its April level.\\nSimilarly, the seasonally adjusted number of Americans working part time for economic reasons increased by approximately 500,000 in May and dropped by approximately 600,000 in June.\\nThe unemployment figures also show this pattern. The number of unemployed Americans fell 484,000 in May and the unemployment rate dropped 0.3 percentage points, mostly driven by Americans leaving the job market and no longer looking for work.\\nUnemployment increased by 347,000 workers in June and the unemployment rate increased 0.2 percentage points, mostly driven by Americans returning to the labor force and looking for work.\\nStatistical noise almost certainly explains these swings.\\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics’ employment reports are surveys. Like all surveys, they have sampling error. Rather than focusing on monthly movements, Americans should look at the long term trend.\\nThese trends show job growth slowed over the past year, but remain far from recessionary levels.']"

    "The heritage foundation, as expected, focuses a lot on religion, state rights, tax, family, and law enforcement. It pays more attention to school/ education than I expected. Also, the high prequency superlative adjectives look quite positive, probably suggesting the point Professor James Evan's paper once talked about: Conservatives like to pretend that they are happy in their linguistic expression. Also, \"they\" is used more than \"we,\" and \"he\" is used more than \"she.\" This may suggest certain mindset, but I need to compare this with a liberal dataset first."

But using the word \"state\" so frequently may suggest a narrative of national myth and a focus on status quo. The adjectives associated with the word \"country\" also suggests a general patriot theme: 'free,' 'proud,' 'great,' 'only,' and 'perfect,' etc. No wonder why this is a corpus from the Heritage Foundation."

    "I parsed two sentences and displayed the phrase structure and dependency parse trees nested. More complicated sentences tend to have deeper parse trees. I also look at a set of focal words. First, \"Trump\" is often mentioned with Zelenskyy, suggesting a strong focus on impeachment topics. I also investigate the active and passive words used for Trump, Obama, and the word \"election.\" There are lots of active words used to describe Trump and the passive words used to describe Trump are mostly negative: it is either Trump say/ do something or Trump is threatened by something. The word Obama is mentioned much less and the active words have less implications of initative (be, leave, sign). Also the word election is mentioned mostly as \"won election\" rather than \"lost election,\" suggesting that the articles focus more on saying how great Trump is rather than analyzing the failure of the Democratic Party."
