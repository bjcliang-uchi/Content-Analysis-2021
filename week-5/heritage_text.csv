Editor’s note: This week we feature two letters that really grabbed our attention, from readers with compelling personal perspectives on the U.S. immigration system. Pull up a chair, and remember to write us at [email protected]—Ken McIntyre
Dear Daily Signal: I couldn’t agree more with Genevieve Wood in her recent commentary headlined “4 Keys to the Immigration Reform We Need.” My wife and I are immigrants from Canada under an E-2 investors visa. 
We are two legal immigrants who invested our
life savings in a small business called Shelley’s Casual Elegance Inc., specializing
in ladies’ fashions in South Florida. We left Canada in late 2005 and have
expanded and improved the business continuously, spending well in excess of
$100,000 of our money and employing over a dozen American citizens in the past
14 years. 
We have spent over $25,000 in fees (government
and lawyers) to ensure that we comply with the requirements of the laws of the
United States, yet in spite of that, we have no “pathway to citizenship.” Our
E-2 visa does not give us permanent resident status, but in fact classifies us
as resident aliens who are permitted to stay year-round, but leave at least
once every two years and return to comply.
We would gladly become citizens if the law
permitted it, but instead have to go back to the U.S. consulate in Toronto
every five years and beg for another extension to our five-year visa. 
We’ve done it a couple of times and as you can understand it is very stressful, knowing that we own a home here in Florida and  for 14 years have been debt-free, supporting ourselves and being a valued asset to our community. 
Self-sufficient and married for 38 years, we get upset when people talk about giving amnesty to those who effectively have cut in line in front of law-abiding people like us.
Hopefully, sanity will prevail and someday we’ll get a chance to be loyal citizens of this country. In the meantime, we have to go back to the consulate and hope the State Department staff person is not having a bad day when we appear in front of him or her.—Gary and Shelley Cahill, Naples, Fla. 
Dear Daily Signal: Please allow me to honor my father, Francis L. Ross, a true American patriot. Born in Sioux City, Iowa, in 1930, he grew up dirt poor. 
My grandmother had grown up in a
house made of sod, and my grandfather’s only skill was horse trading. My
father’s parents couldn’t even afford to buy my father a toy truck that cost only
a nickel. 
At 9, my father stood in the snow
late at night in bare feet. He watched while the only home he’d ever known
burned to the ground and left him with nothing but the pajamas he was wearing. 
The house my father’s family
subsequently rented was so filthy he had to shovel chicken droppings out of it
before they could move in. In high school, his parents couldn’t afford a lock
for his locker, so he couldn’t play football.
But he believed in the American dream,
and that was all he needed to get ahead. When his country called on him to serve
in the Marine Corps, he did his duty without complaint. As a navigator, he flew
48 missions in Korea, sometimes with the bottom shot out of the plane. 
When he returned to El Toro Marine
Base near Irvine, California, he married my mother. He attended UCLA on the GI
Bill, not a handout. He earned a master’s degree in engineering and paid high
taxes—as high
as 50 percent—for most of his life. 
He died in 2010 from cancer, hoping
his children and grandchildren would live the same American dream. Unfortunately,
that dream has been handed to people who have done nothing to deserve it. They
are only out for what they can get. 
If Americans are left with nothing in
the process, so be it. According to the progressives, illegal immigrants are
somehow morally superior to the rest of us. 
I am a senior citizen with a
disability, and no doctor wants to treat me because Medicare pays only half or
less than what private insurance companies pay for. If doctors work for a
medical group, they are contractually obligated to treat Medicare patients, and
so they deliberately inflict pain on me, frighten me, or anger me so I will go
away.
Now California Gov. Gavin Newsom
wants to give adult illegal aliens Medi-Cal, the Medicaid program in the state.
His predecessor already gave the benefits to illegal alien children. 
About the time he did so, I lost three
teeth. An unethical Medi-Cal dentist, I believe, destroyed two of them needing
crowns on purpose, so that I would go away. The other tooth was pulled because
I didn’t have money for a filling. Medi-Cal no longer covers fillings, only
tooth pulling. For that, dentists receive $15 instead of the usual $75.
When I think of the sacrifices my father made so that his children could have a better life, I want to cry. 
Those of us with ancestors and relatives who earned the right to be here are living a Third World existence, with the fear that the situation will get only worse as our elected representatives continue to hand our assets over to foreign invaders who erroneously believe it is their right to have them.—Melinda Santa Cruz, Escondido, Calif.
This and That
Dear Daily Signal: Why
are conservative media outlets dancing around the fact that the so-called
Antifa activists are no different than the Nazi Brownshirts and Blackshirts and
the KKK?  
We have mayors, members of Congress, and the media supporting Antifa’s actions, thuggery, and extreme violence. These black-clad people belong in jail cells, and the people funding their actions should be arrested for aiding and abetting terrorism.
Why hasn’t the Justice Department, FBI, and Homeland Security gone after the bagmen and thugs? The mayor of Portland, Oregon, should be charged with violating the civil rights of those recently assaulted by Antifa thugs. 
Notice any common denominators in locations that give these terrorists cover? Is the population of Portland so spineless it supports this kind of terrorism?—Chris Kastner

Dear Daily Signal: Thank you so much for Heritage Foundation President Kay Coles James’ true and beautiful Fourth of July message to us, the commentary headlined “A Nation Worth Lauding.”
It
was very difficult to read. Tears kept blurring my vision. 
God
bless and keep my dear sister and fellow American. I’m thankful for her
leadership, faith, godly wisdom, courage, example, and love. 
If she ever decides to run for president (of the U.S., that is), she most definitely would have my vote.—J.D.
***
Dear Daily Signal: I respectfully disagree with Olivia Enos’ commentary, “Trump-Kim Photo Op at the DMZ Fails to Deliver.” As long as Kim Jong Un isn’t shooting ICBMs over South Korea, Japan, and Hawaii, I think that President Trump is making significant progress with the unstable leader of North Korea. 
None of us expected Kim to
“instantly” shut down his nuke program.  But Trump’s
unconventional negotiation process of sanctions plus diplomacy is slowly
working. Kim may never shut down his nuclear testing, but as long he’s not
launching ICBMs, it’s a victory for Trump.
How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time.—Allen Muench
***
Dear Daily Signal: I want to thank your reporter Rachel del Guidice for the article regarding Alveda King and her comments about what Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has been saying recently regarding abortion and eugenics (“MLK’s Niece Applauds Clarence Thomas for Linking Abortion, Eugenics”).
I
had forgotten that Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger was a consultant
for the Ku Klux Klan. I also did not know that Alveda King is now working for
Priests for Life.
Although I am not able to afford a membership in The Heritage Foundation, I am praying for your organization and an end to the culture of death.—Mary Meurer, St. Louis, Mo.  
How Are We Doing?
Dear Daily Signal: Thank you for The Daily Signal’s thoughtful, well-written news and commentary. Your articles are where I go for help sorting out the mainstream media and Fox News Channel, as they make their news about the moment, impact, and sensation. 
Without your insightful stories, I would be less informed about the goings-on of this world.—Howard Otton 
***
I always thought that the “liberal” party in the USA was called the Democrat Party, composed of Democrats. It rankles when the party is labeled by the media as the Democratic Party. 
It
seems far less democratic than the Republican Party (composed, of course, of Republicans).
The word “democratic” has a specific meaning and connotation that does not
belong to the Democrat Party.—Stephen
Jessee

I appreciate your news. Thank you for being a good source on illegal immigration. I wondered if you know of some of the diseases that illegal aliens bring in, and are aware of the book “Fraud: How the Left Plans to Steal the Next Election,” by Eric Eggers. We really must stop the hemorrhages.—Alice K.
***
Please do not post tons of videos.  We don’t need music, pictures, etc., to get our information. At least include a script, so we can get the info and not be held hostage by endless videos.—Carol Stine
***
I enjoy The Daily Signal and appreciate the title and short blurb from each article included in your Morning Bell email. It would be nice if you also would add the author to each synopsis.—Marie Boyd
***
Do you think the left-wing corporate presidents (who the stockholders should vote out) and the left-wing media are trying to scare us into a recession in time for the 2020 election?—Robert Albanese
***
I absolutely love The Daily Signal. There is no other publication like it. I’d feel lost without it!—Loretta Lewis

"Volunteers paint over a wall covered in graffiti. (Photo: Jose Luis Pelaez Inc/Getty Images) 
The “Bethel effect” is a term used to describe the community impact of Bethel Church in Redding, California. The congregation has gained national and international attention for its hands-on approach to serving the city.
Pastor Kris Vallotton joins The Daily Signal Podcast today to explain how and why Bethel Church has chosen to love its community through action. He also explains how Americans can have real political impact and engage in dialogue with those who hold different views. Listen to the podcast or read the lightly edited transcript below. 
Virginia Allen: I am joined by Pastor Kris Vallotton of Bethel Church in Redding, California. He’s also a bestselling author, international speaker, and cultural leader. Pastor Kris, thank you so much for joining me.
Kris Vallotton: Thanks for having me on. Allen: You’re the senior associate leader of Bethel Church and co-founder of Bethel School of Supernatural Ministry.
Bethel has been gaining the attention of not just the church community, but people all over the world for quite some time. But recently, a lot of that attention has been focused around Bethel’s community impact, which we’re going to discuss a bit today. In fact, there’s been a phrase coined in Redding for this impact, and people have been calling it the “Bethel effect.” The San Francisco Chronicle wrote a great article about Bethel just a few months ago, saying that “no institution in our state is better at engaging with its hometown.” It went on to say that “the lack of structure and Bethel’s assistance to its hometown suggests a broader lesson for community building. Stop overthinking things and just throw yourself, heart and soul, into addressing people’s needs.” I mean, wow. It’s incredible to see the news media realizing the amazing impact this culture of service [at] Bethel is having in Redding and in Shasta County, where you are located. How have you all created this culture of service? Vallotton: Well, I don’t know that we’ve created it, actually, but let’s say we’ve influenced it. There’s a lot of participants, there’s a lot of heroes in the Redding culture that aren’t related to Bethel, of course, so I can only speak to the part that we play. 
And that is, some years ago, we asked ourselves the question: If it’s supposed to be, if Jesus taught us to pray that it would be on earth as it is in heaven—and our city at that time, about 17 years ago, was listed as one of the worst cities under a hundred thousand people to live in—how are we supposed to affect that? … Our church attendance is around 11,000 people on a weekend, our city is 90,000. If a church of 11,000—not including a whole bunch of other wonderful churches in our community—are living in a community and the commentary of that community and the social statistics of that community are [saying] “This is the one of the worst cities in America to live in,” what does that say about our actual ministry? So we started asking ourselves the question, “Is this our problem?” As a church, as a leadership team, is this our problem? Are these bad statistics our problem? Or is the fact that they’re not our problem the problem? 
If we’re supposed to make disciples of nations, and we’re supposed to pray that it’d be on earth as it is in heaven, and we’re supposed to pray that God prospers and blesses our city, and the commentary on our city is completely opposite of that, what do we do about that? So that’s where it started. And we started realizing that the truth is that large churches don’t necessarily mean healthy communities. 
I wrote a book that you might know about, it’s called “Heavy Rain.” And in that book I was doing a statistical study. We did a statistical study on American cities, and we learned that the cities that had the greatest Christian churchgoing population had the worst social statistics in our nation. You know, Jesus said, “You’re the light of the world.” And the problem is that most of the church thinks that the world needs to get darker and darker and the church gets brighter and brighter until Jesus gets back. 
But Jesus didn’t say, “You’re the light of the church.” He said, “You’re the light of the world.” So if the world’s getting darker and darker, it feels like it might be our responsibility to bring some light and hope. … Jesus is called the hope of the nations, so maybe we’re supposed to play a different role in our city. 
It began with, if you will, a theological, philosophical change. Like, this is our responsibility. It’s our responsibility to actually bring heaven to earth. It’s our responsibility to bring the full impact of a good God and a prosperous kingdom to bear on a broken city. Allen: You all have taken that responsibility on in really, really practical ways. I want to ask you about the Carr fires in the summer of 2018. Obviously, devastating across Redding and Shasta County. Vallotton: Totally. Allen: You all were in the center of some of the worst destruction. What was your community’s response to that tragedy? Vallotton: Well, our City Council did a wonderful job. Several believers on the City Council went to Santa Rosa, where they’d had a very similar fire two or three years before, and counseled with them and said, “What did you learn from your tragedy?” And they brought back some great information there. 
We said, “What can we do to help relieve the pain that’s happening in our community?” Of course, we opened up our church building, we partnered with the Salvation Army. We became the distribution center for food for several weeks, I think it was two or three weeks. And then we called out to our friends and said, “Can you help us? We’ve got 1,100 homes that have burnt down.” And we raised $1.7 million in two weeks from our friends around the world who just gave us money to help distribute. So we distributed a thousand dollars to every person who had lost their home, Christian or not. It didn’t matter if they went to church or didn’t go to a church. 
Then several of them were able to go back and give some more money too. And then we developed a team of people that went through and sifted through the ashes. It’s pretty traumatic, you know? You had to wear a hazmat suit, it was 105 degrees out. And we just went from house to house sifting through the ashes to find valuables. It sounds crazy, but that was really profound. 
And then when it was all over, and we developed a team—and Joyce Meyer’s ministry partnered with us, which was beautiful—we were able to take  almost $800,000 and buy equipment, because you can’t rebuild a house until you clear the property. 
We were able to buy tractors and chippers, and hire two full-time teams that just went from house to house and took down all the burnt trees and chipped them and got their property ready to rebuild. And we’re still in that process. We have two full-time teams right now that’ll probably spend another year and a half finishing just those properties. Allen: Wow, that’s amazing. … Obviously, Bethel got a lot of attention around the Carr fires, but it wasn’t a new thing to start reaching out and influencing. When the Redding Police Department was about to lay off four officers due to tight budgets, you all raised the money to keep them on the force. You volunteered your time and resources to clean the large, iconic Sundial Bridge in Redding when it was in need of repair. 
We all know that, yes, we’re supposed to care for the poor and care for those in need, but you all have taken this holistic approach to community-building and to caring for the community. Why did you feel like that was so important? Vallotton: Well, it’s our city. One of the things that we are learning together is that until you take ownership of your land, you’ll never be part of the solution. When you think about how important land was to the promises of God, you remember the children of Israel were in bondage for 400 years and God wanted him to lead them into a promised land. 
Think about 1st Chronicles 7:14, “If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves to pray, seek my face … ” and so on and so forth, “I will hear from heaven, forgive their sins, and heal their land.” And it just goes on and on and on. 
What we learned is that you just won’t solve the problem of your city without taking ownership of it. And we began to say, “This isn’t just a city, this is our city. This isn’t just a people, this is our people.” 
I think that you’ll see that that strategy is throughout the book of Nehemiah, in the resolution of the broken walls. You know, the walls of Israel were broken down for 114 years. They had tried to rebuild them for 72 years. And what they couldn’t do in 72 years, Nehemiah did in 52 days. One of the secrets of the restoration of the walls and gates of Israel is that he made everyone an owner, and even families worked on the wall together. … 
So we say, “This is our city…” And so we began to take ownership of it. 
As you know, we put 2,500 students to work in our city every week. Every single student has to work in our city as part of their education. When students graduate from our school and they go back to their homes, we want them not just to think about, “How do I lead someone to Christ?” We want them to think, “What can I do to make my city a better place to live in?” Allen: What are some of those practical tools that you give your students or church members who move on to other communities? Because it’s easy to hear all the amazing work that Bethel’s doing and think, “I want to do that here in my own city.” But honestly, it’s a little overwhelming when you don’t have a lot of resources. And maybe you’re the only one in your community that’s really gung-ho about this. 
So what would you say to someone that maybe is in a church of 100 or 300, or has a community group of 15, and wants to start doing this? Vallotton: First of all, I want to say, don’t despise the day of small beginnings, because if I explained to you where we started 17 years ago, you would be like, “Oh, how is that going to help?” It’s like, well, you have to start somewhere, you know? 
In those days we had no money, and we had a much smaller sphere of influence, and my congregation was much smaller. So we just began to reach out. You can’t do everything, but you can do something. You can’t help everyone, but you can help someone. So we just began to evaluate, like, “How can we help?” The first thing that we did, personally, is we went to see our city manager, and we said: “This is what we’re kind of good at, and we’d love to help, and we don’t know what is your vision, and is there any place where we can help?” And you can imagine it takes a long time to build trust. I’d say it took three to five years to build trust. 
But we didn’t come in and say, “Hey, here’s our vision. We’d sure like the City Council to vote in this way.” And, “Why aren’t our roads being fixed?” And, “How come you’re not … ” We didn’t do that. 
We went to our city manager and later to our City Council, and we said,        “[These are] the resources we have, and these are the people we have. Is there any way we can help?” Our city manager was very gracious, and he said, “Well, we have a very reduced park and rec budget. We’re not able to clean adequately our parks and our recreation areas, and if you have any desire to do that … ” 
We’re like, “Yeah, we’ll do that.” … 
The first year was terrible; we did a terrible job. We’d put 50 students on a team with five rakes. We’d have 45 people standing around. [We] just didn’t think through it well. But eventually, we hired a person to be in charge of that. I would say in a smaller church, obviously, you’d have a volunteer. 
And little by little, we bought $1 million worth of equipment. We didn’t do that right away, we did it little by little. We bought tractors and trailers and chainsaws, and we started a certification program for landscape. 
But you know, what we did is we just did ordinary things in a way no one had ever seen before. We did simple things like clean a park, but when we were done cleaning that park, no one had ever seen a park cleaned like that. When they gave us streets to sweep, we swept streets like no one had ever seen before. 
Whatever they gave us to do, no matter how menial the task, we did it like Michelangelo, who said, “I saw the angel in the stone and I carved to set it free.” I’d say, “We aren’t raking lawns, we are freeing angels.” 
And we just began to have a vision to prove to our city that we as a people of God have a spirit of excellence on us, and whether you give us a little project or a big project, we were going to handle it with responsibility and excellence and a great attitude. Allen: I love that, that’s so good.  I want to take a moment and dive a little bit deeper into this idea of impacting culture, and discuss it from a political perspective. 
You know, today, if I say the words “America’s political culture,” a lot of thoughts and opinions will instantly jump into someone’s mind. But Bethel uses the word “culture” quite a lot. And you specifically talk about creating a culture of honor. 
Can you explain what you mean by that, and what you think it looks like to bring a culture of honor into our political conversations? Vallotton: First of all, I think it means that every individual deserves honor no matter their opinion, whether it be political opinion or other opinions of life. Whether it’s around the subject of the gay community, or whether it’s the Republicans, the Democrats, the Independents, whatever. I think no matter your stance, because you are created by God, you are a child of God, you’re a son or daughter of God. So I think that we have to realize that we can have very different opinions and still value somebody. And I think when President [Barack] Obama was president, he didn’t carry a lot of my moral values in his presidency, at least publicly, I never have met him personally, but [he was] my president. And he’s a son of God. And I would post on my Facebook pages and social pages, and from the podium I would say, “I love President Obama. He’s my president. I pray for him.” 
Some of our people in our movement, which tend to be quite on the Republican side, they’d write me some really strong statements, and I’m like, “I never said I agree with President Obama. I said I love him and I’m praying for him.” And now President [Donald] Trump is president, and I do the same thing with President Trump. I love him and I pray for him. Whether I agree with him on issues or on every issue, that’s not the point. 
What’s going to happen if we stop praying for people? What happens when Christians pull out of culture? And when we vacate culture, we’re leaving that culture to the demonic realm, to lead that culture. And that’s just dumb. So if you want to actually have influence with the king or the queen, you don’t want to throw rocks at the palace. So I think that you have to decide if you want to be a Daniel, Joseph, or Esther. If you want to actually have influence in our country, in the White House, or with your mayor, or with your governor, throwing rocks at them—especially on a public platform—just doesn’t make any sense. So I understand the frustration that people have, and I’ve had it myself and I haven’t always gone about it right. But if I’m going to have any influence with someone I don’t agree with, I’m going to have to treat them honorably. Because you only have as much influence in people’s life as they have value for you. If they don’t have any value for you, you’re not going to be influencial with them. So that’s kind of our stance. Allen: That’s great. And Kris, you have built relationships with a number of national and international political leaders who span across the political spectrum. So how do you go about honoring those leaders in your interactions with them? Vallotton: Yes, absolutely. Well, I met with political leaders for the last 14 years in several countries and on both sides of the aisle. And when I meet with a Democrat or a Republican, I’m not there to talk through their view on abortion. If they want my opinion, I gladly bring it. But I’m there with this one agenda: “How do I make your life better? How can I help you fulfill the call that God has put on your life?” 
And if you’re a Democrat, if you’re a Republican, my job isn’t to question your political values as much as it is to bring wisdom to the decisions that you have to make every day. 
Some people are like, “I don’t see how you could sit with that person who’s pro-abortion.” I’m like, “Well, did you see how Daniel related to Nebuchadnezzar and four worldly kings?” 
I truly do not understand how people cannot have grace in America for politicians that they don’t agree with when we see so much grace demonstrated, even in the Old Covenant, by Joseph, Daniel, and Esther. 
I ask myself every day, “How could you be so critical of our president?”— whether it’s a Democrat or Republican president. And, “How do you expect to influence that president if you post horrible stuff about them?” 
And especially the kind of stuff where you judge their motives: “Oh, you’re trying to kill babies,” or, “You’re trying to destroy our country.” It’s like, “Oh, gosh.” Stuff that’s just not wise, you know? And it’s also not true. Allen: Thank you so much for sharing that. And I want to ask you, you have so many great resources on this topic and a host of others, so how can our listeners learn more, follow your work, and find out more about what Bethel is up to? Vallotton: They can get on my website, kvministries.com … I am on all the social pages. Or you can get on bethel.com and find out everything you want to know about Bethel. And there’s all kinds of free resources on both those sites if you like what you see there. 
Also we have, obviously, webcasts and podcasts and Bethel TV. You can get on Bethel TV and watch what we preach in the morning for free, and it’s quite extensive. Allen: Awesome. Pastor Kris, thank you so much for your time and for joining me today. Vallotton: Virginia, thank you so much for having me on. I hope I helped some people. Allen: Absolutely. Really appreciate it.

"Then-U.S. Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas raises his right hand as he is sworn in on Sept. 10, 1991, during confirmation hearings before the U.S Senate Judiciary Committee in Washington D.C. (Photo: J. David Ake/AFP/ Getty Images)
Justice Clarence Thomas is famously quiet on the Supreme Court. But a new movie, “Created Equal: Clarence Thomas in His Own Words,” is drawn from an exclusive interview with Thomas. Filmmaker Michael Pack shares what he learned about Thomas. Read a lightly edited transcript of the interview, pasted below, or listen on the podcast:

Jarrett Stepman: We are now speaking to filmmaker Michael Pack. Pack is the director of the soon-to-be-released documentary “Created Equal: Clarence Thomas in His Own Words.” The movie is set to come out on Jan. 31. Michael, thanks so much for joining us on The Daily Signal.
Michael Pack: Thank you for having me.
Stepman: First off, explain the thread of the documentary. I mean, Clarence Thomas wrote a memoir, “My Grandfather’s Son,” many years ago, but it seems that many Americans don’t know a lot about Clarence Thomas the man. Does the documentary delve into his childhood, his upbringing, his past?
Pack: It does, I mean, exactly. Most Americans don’t know about it. And really the purpose of the film is to tell his whole story and to dispel the myths and fabrications that have grown up over the years. 
The format of the film is called “Created Equal: Clarence Thomas in His Own Words” because it’s mainly Justice Thomas speaking directly to camera and telling his story from birth all the way up to today. 
It’s based on a three-hour interview that I conducted with Justice Thomas and Ginni, his wife. And only them. There are no other interviews.
He tells his story as he sees it from the very beginning, right to camera. There are recreations, there’s archival footage, there are stills, but there’s no other interview. You hear the story from Justice Thomas because it’s a great story, and in talking to people, he was overwhelmingly the best to tell it. He’s a great storyteller with a wonderful voice.
Stepman: Yeah. That really will be something, especially as Thomas is notably quiet on the Supreme Court. Getting to actually hear this from Thomas himself seems to be one of the most interesting aspects of this documentary.
One thing that really struck me, certainly about Thomas’ life, is his kind of political transformation. Obviously, [he] had rich experiences growing up. [He] grew up in, at the time, [the] still-segregated state of Georgia. Obviously, some harrowing times there. 
But he really had a political transformation. He really was, as a young man, a man of the left, I think [he] even supported the Black Panthers and ended up as an appointee of the Reagan administration, obviously, an appointee to the Supreme Court of Republican President George H.W. Bush. 
Can you kind of explain that transformation? Because it seems kind of wild on its face.
Pack: Well, that’s right. That’s one of the reasons it’s a great story, because it’s … not only a Horatio Alger story of going from dire poverty and segregation, as you said, to the highest court of land, but of these political, emotional, spiritual changes. And he’s very articulate about it. 
As you say, he was born in the South, he was born in Pin Point just outside of Savannah, Gullah Geechee area. So he grew up speaking a dialectic, a Geechee dialect, not even English. They were dirt poor. His mother worked in a crab factory. But they had a lot to eat. It was relatively idyllic. 
And then she moved to Savannah where she worked as a maid and took care of Justice Thomas and his brother. But she just couldn’t make ends meet. He was hungry. He was cold in the winter. She’d take him to school, he’d wander the streets. It was really dire poverty of a kind few experience and in the midst of the segregated south.
So then, [when] he was about 8, she brought him to her father, his grandfather, to raise because she realized she couldn’t take care of him. And that is what turned Justice Thomas’ life around. His grandfather who was poor and nearly illiterate, but he had a small home heating oil business. 
He gave Thomas and his brother a decent home, discipline, hard work, values. He had converted to Roman Catholicism. He sent them to parochial school, also a segregated school, but run by Irish nuns who gave him more discipline, a great education. And that really turned his life around from the sort of drifting in poverty to this new path. 
And he was so successful. He wanted to study to be a priest and he entered seminary and he would’ve been one of the first African American priests in Savannah. But as you implied, or as you said, he became disenchanted with all that. 
It was the late ’60s, … he was watching Martin Luther King [Jr.] being shot on TV in ’68 and one of the seminarians said, “I hope that son of a b—- dies,” and that was just too much for Justice Thomas. It was just too much racism there. The church was doing too little about civil rights, and then he flipped and felt, “No, this is all wrong.”
And he lost his vocation. He said he wanted to leave the seminary. 
When he told his grandfather, his grandfather kicked him out, the only home he had ever known and he was adrift and he became an angry black man. He saw race and racism explained everything. His grandfather was a sucker, but he was on his own, he had to go wherever he could.
He happened to have a full scholarship at Holy Cross College in Worcester, Massachusetts, a Catholic school. He went up there and there he partook, as you said, in the black radicalism of the ’60s. He helped form the Black Student Union. He engaged in walkouts. As you said, he invited a Black Panther to come speak on the campus. And as Thomas said, they were supporters of everybody who was in your face, Angela Davis, Huey Newton, whomever.
And then a large part of the film is Justice Thomas’ turning away from that, recapturing his faith, coming back to Catholicism, his discovery that all the programs on the left were not working, especially busing in nearby Boston and affirmative action and a lot of the ideas and anti-Americanism of the black radicalism no longer appealed to him. 
He sort of started to see through it and drifted to the right until, as you say, he finally went to work for the Reagan administration in the ’80s, and worked first in the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Education, and then the EOC. And then finally he was nominated by George H.W. Bush for the Supreme Court and had that extremely contentious confirmation battle.
But from the time he went to work for Reagan and was a public figure, he was battling people who didn’t agree with him. Civil rights leaders, people on the left, people who said, as he says in the documentary, that he was the wrong kind of black man. 
So it culminated in the hearing and that’s a very dramatic story and he tells it in a very moving way. And then he talks about the jurisprudence on the Supreme Court.
So you’re right, it’s a very complex story. It’s hard to understand if you don’t hear it directly from Justice Thomas, which viewers will be able to do.
Stepman: Of course. What made you tell this story of Clarence Thomas now? Does this have anything to do with the recent confirmation battles over Brett Kavanaugh? Did it have to do with some of his tussles with Joe Biden? Why now? Why come forward with the story at this point?
Pack: Well, documentaries take a long time. We’ve been working on it for almost three years, but I have to say, it’s become more relevant. 
The Kavanaugh hearing happened in the middle of our production period. The #MeToo movement happened. But I think all that makes it very important to hear a Thomas’ story. 
The #MeToo movement likes to say that Anita Hill is its Rosa Parks, founding mother of the movement. But it’s good to look at the real story. I think your podcast is very focused on correcting the myths of history, and that’s a myth.
And the same thing with the Brett Kavanaugh hearing. It was, in a lot of ways, a replay of the Thomas hearing. A lot of people noticed that on both sides. So it’s worth thinking about what it was that was replayed. 
I think it’s very current for the time. But I actually think it’s current beyond the time. I think Justice Thomas’ story is a great story, a great American story, and will be 20 or 30 years from now as well as now. 
Although I think it’s ripe for the moment, it’s beyond that. I think it’s an inspiring story of overcoming great obstacles, of resilience in the face of many, many challenges. And of somebody who could easily have defined himself as a victim and chose not to. 
It’s a great illustration of that path, which is maybe not adequately celebrated today. So I think although it’s of the moment, it’s beyond that.
Stepman: Yeah, absolutely. And to get more [to] the connection to now modern politics, you could say one of the more interesting aspects in the movie is getting into Thomas’ confrontations and his battles in the Senate, especially with now-presidential candidate Joe Biden, who was the chairman, I believe, of the Judiciary Committee at the time.
Today is actually the anniversary, the 47th anniversary, of Roe v. Wade. Obviously, Clarence Thomas has been critical of that decision. That did come up during his hearings. But there’s actually an interesting moment. 
I wonder if you could explain where Thomas actually talks about his battles with Biden and some of the debates over natural law jurisprudence in the Constitution. Can you kind of talk about that a little bit?
Pack: Yes. Justice Thomas’ attitudes toward natural law are actually a theme of the film and his sense of how natural law and originalism inform his jurisprudence. 
But in the first part of the hearing, Biden asked extremely complex philosophical questions along those lines. But for Justice Thomas, it was that they were a meandering way to get him to say something about Roe and to commit himself. And I think this was the first part of the hearing. 
Some people don’t remember that his hearings had two parts. There was a week of very grueling testimony where the Biden inquiry came in. And also they accused him of lots of stuff—smoking marijuana, being an anti-Semite—that he had to answer that was in the press. Plus, very tough grilling.
Then he felt it was over. And these senators had voted split on the committee, but sent his name forward. And then when this full Senate was getting ready to vote, the Anita Hill allegations were leaked. And then it went back to the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
So it’s in the first hearing that Joe Biden sort of pressed him on natural law, as Justice Thomas says, as a way to get him to say something about Roe that they could use as a reason not to confirm him. … Since you say, it’s the anniversary of Roe, many, many of the groups opposed to him had that as their explicit reason for doing it. I mean, it was a very political, very concerted effort.
Stepman: Yeah. Again, there seems to be some connection, especially when you talk about the modern Kavanaugh hearings as well, that that issue seems to come up very big and play prominently. 
And then, of course, you get the ugliness of the accusations, the sexual assault, and, of course, the media really plays into that as well in creating that storm. 
So one question I think I’d like to ask is who is your intended audience of the movie? If you could sit any group of people in this country down and say, “Watch this movie,” who would it be?
Pack: I really made the movie for people who don’t know Justice Thomas and don’t have their minds made up. Those are beyond just your listeners. 
I believe it’s convincing to people who don’t know him and have many of these misconceptions: he’s quiet, he doesn’t speak, he’s not smart, he doesn’t have many opinions, he’s not active on the court. And I think you can’t think that after you see this film.
 … It’s going to be in movie theaters, as you said, Jan. 31. And the people who are partisans of Justice Thomas and maybe your listeners need to go and show up and buy tickets. The people on the other side are very good at doing that. 
Our film is often compared or contrasted to “RBG,” about Ruth Bader Ginsburg. It did fabulously well at the box office. All of her fans … showed up. So the people who might be sympathetic to Thomas have to show up, too. 
It’ll be in 15 or so theaters on Jan. 31, and if people show up, it’ll be in many more. They can go to our website, JusticeThomasmovie.com, and see where it’s playing in their area. And if it’s not playing and there’s a big enough group of 30 or 40, we can make a showing in the area that they are [in]. There’s ways to sign up for that on the website.
So the purpose of the film is really to bring Justice Thomas back to the prominence and respect that he deserves. And I don’t think that will happen unless there’s some groundswell out there. So I hope that your show helps create that groundswell.
Stepman: Yeah, we definitely hope so, too. 
It’s interesting. There were some controversies at the African American museum here in Washington, D.C., that Clarence Thomas didn’t get enough of a prominent position. 
Obviously, you could say, at this point, [he’s] one of the greatest Americans who’s been on the Supreme Court, and has an incredible story. I think that’s inspirational, especially for young Americans who do grow up in bad circumstances. 
I mean, few have experienced the kind of struggles that he did as a young man and yet rose to this position and became not just a man who succeeded but is such a learned man and understanding of the law, really one of the most prominent positions in American life. 
It seems that a lot of young Americans, in particular, can learn from that story and create an inspiration that they can empower themselves rather than feeling like victims.
Pack: Absolutely. That is really true. And we hope that beyond its time in theaters and on TV, or wherever it goes, that we’ll be able to get excerpts from it and curriculum materials into schools [for] Black History Month. There’s a lot of counter narratives to that. 
The 1619 Project has curriculum materials and Black Lives Matter and there’s [the] reparations movement. And we hope that our film, or parts of our film, with curriculum materials can be incorporated into every high school across America because I think it is inspiring to young people, especially African Americans, but not only. And I think it’s a counter narrative to the sort of victimhood that many put forward. I mean, it’s another way of living your life that Justice Thomas illustrates, and I think it is very inspiring.
Stepman: Yeah, that’s great. That’s definitely maybe a pro-1776, a man who’s actually experienced racism and terrible things in this country yet embraces the principles that made America great to begin with. Truly inspiring story, as you said, very much counters the opinions of some at the 1619 Project that directly counters and says that are founding ideals are wrong. So absolutely an inspirational story. 
Michael, thank you so much for joining us. The name of the movie is “Created Equal: Clarence Thomas in His Own Words.” It’s out Jan. 31 and it’s definitely going to be a must-see. Thank you so much, Michael, for joining us.
Pack: Thank you. And go to that website, JusticeThomasmovie.com.
Stepman: Thank you very much.

"White House counsel Pat Cipollone arrives Tuesday with President Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Jay Sekulow, for the Senate impeachment trial at the Capitol. (Photo: Mark Wilson/Getty Images)
President Donald Trump’s lawyers briskly completed final arguments against removing their client from office Tuesday, taking a fraction of the 24 hours allotted to them in the Senate impeachment trial.
Their wrapup Tuesday after less than two hours—following two hours Saturday and eight hours Monday—was a stark contrast from House Democrats’ impeachment managers. 
The Democrats logged three marathon days in the Senate, arguing for more than 21 hours in all for Trump’s ouster for abusing his power and obstructing Congress in connection with a July 25 phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. 
Next, senators will be able to submit questions in writing for the prosecution and defense teams to answer for up to eight hours Wednesday and Thursday.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., announced late Tuesday that Democrats so far may have enough Republican votes to call witnesses in the trial.  
Here are highlights of the Trump team’s closing arguments.
During their phone conversation in July, Trump and Zelenskyy briefly discussed Trump’s interest in Ukraine’s investigating the dealings there of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. 
The younger Biden joined the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy firm, while his father was President Barack Obama’s point man on Ukraine policy. 
Trump also told Zelenskyy that he would like Ukraine to investigate whether that nation interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
At the time, Ukraine’s president didn’t know that Trump had put a hold on $391 million in military aid, which he would release in September. 
Early on Tuesday, Trump personal lawyer Jay Sekulow took on revelations reported over the past day about a Ukraine-related passage in former Trump national security adviser John Bolton’s forthcoming book.  
The book, The New York Times and others reported, will say that Trump told Bolton he put a hold on the military aid to Ukraine because he wanted the former Soviet republic to investigate the Bidens. 
“You cannot impeach a president on unsourced allegations,” Sekulow said. 
He cited another of Trump’s lawyers, Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, who said the night before that even if true, the incident did not rise to the level of impeachment.
“I want to be clear on this, because there is a lot of speculation out there,” Sekulow said. “With regard to what John Bolton has said … here’s what the president said, in response to that New York Times piece: ‘I never told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens.’”
Sekulow was reading from Trump’s tweeted response to the Times’ story Sunday. He also invoked Alexander Hamilton’s sentiment on cautious impeachments.  
“What we are involved in here as we conclude is the most solemn of duties under our constitutional framework: the trial of the leader of the free world and the duly elected president of the United States. It is not a game of leaks and unsourced manuscripts,” Sekulow said. 
“Hamilton put impeachment in the hands of this body, the Senate, precisely and specifically to be above that fray,” he said. “This is the greatest deliberative body on Earth.”
White House counsel Pat Cipollone gave the last argument, in which he made the case against continuing the trial with witnesses.
Cipollone called on senators to end what another Trump lawyer had called the “era of impeachment” on Monday.
“The Senate cannot allow this to happen,” the White House counsel said, adding: “This should end now, as quickly as possible. Reject these articles of impeachment for our country and for the American people.”
Sekulow argued that impeaching and removing a president through two articles of impeachment that do not allege a crime is a dangerous path to establish for future presidents.
He said the words “danger, danger, danger” at several points in his closing argument.
“In our presentation so far, you have now heard from legal scholars from a variety of schools of thought, from a variety of political backgrounds. But they do have a common theme with a dire warning: danger, danger, danger,” Sekulow said.
Sekulow said future presidents could be “paralyzed from their first day in office” if the Senate allows the impeachment standard for Trump to stand.
“To lower the bar of impeachment based on these articles of impeachment would impact the functioning of our constitutional republic and the framework of that Constitution for generations,” he said.
Specifically, Sekulow said, this could intrude on a president’s foreign policy by giving the legislative branch veto power if lawmakers question a president’s intentions:
The claim that foreign policy decisions can be deemed abuses of power—based on subjective opinions about mixed or sole motives that the president was interested only in helping himself–demonstrates the dangers of employing the vague, subjective, and politically malleable phrase ‘abuse of power’ as a constitutionally permissible criteria for the removal of a president.
Sekulow stressed that elections are supposed to determine the next president.
“You are being asked to remove a duly elected president of the United States, and you’re being asked to do it in an election year,” he said, adding:
There are some of you in this chamber right now that would rather be someplace else. That’s why we’ll be brief. Why would you rather be somewhere else? Because you’re running for the nomination of your party. I get it. But this is a serious deliberative situation.
Elections are the reason a president runs the executive branch and not executive branch employees who work for a president, White House deputy counsel Patrick Philbin said in making the first arguments of the day. 
“For two centuries, the president has been regarded as the sole organ of the nation in foreign affairs. So the idea that we are going to find out when the president had the wrong subjective motives by comparing what he did to the recommendations of some interagency consensus among staffers is fundamentally anti-constitutional,” Philbin told the senators.
The House Intelligence Committee’s impeachment report to the House Judiciary Committee criticized Trump for acting in his own interest when he did not follow the recommendations of foreign policy advisers regarding his conversation with Zelenskyy.
“It inverts the constitutional structure. It’s also fundamentally anti-democratic because our system is rather unique in the amount of power that it gives to the president,” Philbin said, adding:
The executive here has much more power than in a parliamentary system. But part of the reason that a president can have that power is that he is directly, democratically accountable to the people. There is an election every four years to ensure that the president stays democratically accountable to the people. But those staffers in the supposed interagency who have their meetings and make recommendations to the president are not accountable to the people.
There is no democratic legitimacy or accountability to their decisions or recommendations. That is why the president is the head of the executive branch. That is why he has the authority to actually set policy and make determinations regardless of what the staffers may recommend.

"Roger Scruton has died. Conservatism has lost one of its great thinkers. 
Scruton,
who died Jan. 12 at age 75, authored more than 50
books
on an astonishing number of subjects. He wrote about conservative political
philosophy and Western civilization with erudition and grace, and was a
trenchant critic of leftist thought. 
But Scruton also wrote about other aspects of philosophy, aesthetics, art, music, architecture, literature, conservation and environmentalism, religion, sexual desire, hunting, and wine. He also wrote novels and operas. 
His books
reflect deep learning, but they aren’t academic or ponderous. They explain.
They are clear, compelling, and a joy to read. His work
deepens our understanding of what it means to be human and how to promote human
flourishing.
Among British conservatives, he was rightly regarded as a national treasure. He was knighted in 2016. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted, “RIP Sir Roger Scruton. We have lost the greatest modern conservative thinker – who not only had the guts to say what he thought but said it beautifully.” 
RIP Sir Roger Scruton. We have lost the greatest modern conservative thinker – who not only had the guts to say what he thought but said it beautifully.
Scruton
influenced ideas and events not only in Britain, but around the world. At
significant personal risk, he spoke to, taught, and assisted dissidents in
communist Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Hungary during the Cold War. Many of
those he helped became leaders in post-communist central Europe.
Those
seeking an introduction to Anglo-American conservative thought could do no
better than to read Scruton’s 2018 book “Conservatism: An Invitation to the
Great Tradition.” 
Those seeking to hear him discuss the importance of private property and markets (and a wide variety of other topics) could watch “An Interview with Roger Scruton,” recorded during his visit to The Heritage Foundation in October 2018. 
In 2015, Heritage published his paper, “The Good of Corporations.” Later that year, he gave a lecture at The Heritage Foundation, “The Future of European Civilization: Lessons for America.” In 2003, he spoke at Heritage about “The United States, the United Nations, and the Future of the Nation-State.”
Sir
Roger Scruton is gone, but we are fortunate to have his body of work to inform
us, to challenge us, and to help us continue the work of conserving a free
society.

Whether by accident or by deliberate osmosis, Israel and the
U.S. have adopted similar solutions to their existential problems.
Before 2002, during the various Palestinian intifadas,
Israel suffered hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries from suicide
bombers freely crossing from the West Bank and Gaza into Israel.
In response, Israel planned a vast border barrier. The
international community was outraged. The Israeli left called the idea nothing
short of “apartheid.”
However, after the completion of the 440-mile border barrier—part concrete well, part wire fencing—suicide bombings and terrorist incursions into Israel declined to almost nil.
The wall was not entirely responsible for enhanced Israeli
security. But it freed up border manpower to patrol more vigorously. The
barrier also was integrated with electronic surveillance and tougher laws against
illegal immigration.
The wall also brought strategic and political clarity. Those
who damned Israel but freely crossed its borders sounded incoherent when they
became furious that the barrier prevented access to the hated Zionist entity.
The Trump administration is currently seeking funds to
create new border walls and replace old, porous fencing in order to stem
illegal immigration on the southern border.
The strategy seems similar: The wall will free up manpower
for better border policing. It likewise provides a certain political clarity.
The United States is often criticized by Mexico and other Latin American
countries. It is now being taken to task for the effort to make it more
difficult to illegally enter such a supposedly unwelcome and hostile landscape.
For years, Israel’s great weakness was its dependence on imported energy, while its neighboring enemies grew rich exporting oil and natural gas. Yet in the last decade, Israel has ramped up production to take advantage of its vast natural gas reserves—to the point that it is not just self-sufficient in fossil fuels but soon will become a major exporter.
Now, Israel cannot be threatened economically by either Iran
or various Persian Gulf monarchies. Its economy is stronger than ever. Europeans
suddenly are more accommodating, given that Israel may well become a natural
gas exporter to a fuel-hungry Europe.
Like Israel, but unlike Europe, the U.S. was eager to frack
and horizontally drill to tap vast new fossil fuel reserves. The change in U.S.
strategic energy independence is similarly astounding.
America is now the largest producer of natural gas and oil in the world. Its output has increased world supply, dropped prices, and hurt America’s oil-exporting enemies.
The relative power of Russia and Middle Eastern nations, such as Iran, over U.S. decision-making has radically diminished—along with the need to station huge numbers of American troops in the volatile Middle East.
As in Israel, opponents either argued that more drilling would
ruin the environment or that it would not work. They seem to be wrong on both
counts.
Israel’s foreign policy could be called Jacksonian. Israel allies with friends, neutrals, and former enemies whenever they share particular strategic goals.
In the topsy-turvy Middle East, Israel is now sometimes a strategic partner with formerly hostile regimes in Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and other Gulf monarchies. They all share greater fears of theocratic Iran and its terrorist appendages in Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen.
Apparently, much of the Arab world is no longer as
interested in the Palestinian desire to destroy Israel. Many Palestinian groups
are allied with a despised Iran, while many Arabs believe that Israel’s
strength can sometimes be strategically useful.
Current American realism is similar. The U.S. is neither isolationist nor an interventionist nation-builder. Its foreign policy goals are to enhance its military, expand its already powerful economy, limit its strategic exposure, and bank its resulting hard and soft power to use only as a deterrent force against those who kill Americans or endanger U.S. interests.
Instead of cajoling allies to join us in expeditionary wars
abroad, the U.S. increasingly appears reluctant to intervene, especially in the
Middle East. As a result, former critics are now becoming suppliants requesting
U.S. assistance.
As with Israel, the U.S. is less eager to apply political
litmus tests to its occasional allies. It also seeks to avoid quagmires where
its overwhelming conventional firepower can be neutralized by terrorists and
urban guerrillas.
The promoters of these unconventional policies, Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Donald Trump, are both
despised by their respective establishments and under constant threat of
removal by their livid political opponents.
Yet they both have transformed their respective countries. Their policies remind us that it is sometimes preferable to be respected rather than just be liked—and that when a nation is strong and does not beg for help, it often finds more than it needs.

Editor’s note:  This week’s dip into the mailbag isn’t impeachment free, but does show that much more is on the minds of The Daily Signal’s audience. You too can write us at [email protected]
Dear Daily Signal: Thank you for Katrina Trinko’s well-written, objective article about conditions in San Francisco, which is very rare these days (“Tents, Homelessness, and Misery: 9 Things I Saw in San Francisco”). Living on the East Coast my whole life, I knew nothing really about San Francisco before reading this.
My children and I were studying life in urban America and the problem of homelessness when we came across the article. Ideas have consequences, and bad ones have very bad consequences. 
When
we see the fruit of some of our beliefs we would do well to reconsider the root
rather than trying to hose off the sidewalks.—Heather Peterson
***
Good
to read an honest view of San Francisco. I was last there two years ago. Stayed
at a cheap hotel in the Marina. 
The only part of the city that was awful was the Tenderloin. The rest was pretty clean and in places beautiful. Some homeless, as you will find in all major cities. 
Not sure why the right wing wants to paint San Francisco as far worse than it is—just to condemn some policies they don’t agree with, I guess. 
If you really think SF is awful, you probably haven’t been there—and are probably afraid of big cities in general, country mouse.—Todd Carlson 
Katrina Trinko’s article on the homeless in San Francisco was an excellent description of exactly what exists in that city and other parts of the Bay Area. 
For the past two years, I have been
trying to get the attention of leadership in Oakland and San Francisco to look
at the causes of homelessness and a number of creative and workable solutions to
address the problem.
After reading this article it occurred to me that The Daily Signal may have an interest in doing a follow-up article addressing the causes and solutions. I have put together material and would be happy to offer it.— The Rev. Samuel H. Shafer, California

Dear Daily Signal: I just listened to a Daily Signal Podcast that is one of the most compelling interviews I have ever heard. Speaking about “8 Days,”  his film on sex trafficking, Jaco Booyens was eloquent, compelling, and a moral pillar in his words (“His Sister Was Sex-Trafficked for 6 Years. Here’s How He’s Devoted His Life to Fighting It”).
I really appreciate the questions posed by Rachel del Guidice, and Booyens’ insightful comments regarding moral imperatives for a society and for healthy families as the societal foundation.
We are in approximately the fifth
generation since teaching of a moral code was removed from schools nationwide.
Since most people do not attend churches or receive significant moral teaching
and reinforcement, it is imperative we reinstate teaching of a moral code in
the only place all children can be reached consistently—school. 
Broaching the subject that our society
has largely lost its moral foundation, that morality is no longer a
foundational pillar of society, is so important. And Booyens did that
spectacularly in this interview.
I hope his message is very widely heard. His views need to become a national conversation in media circles. Thank you, Daily Signal, for your part in spreading this message in the way it should go.—Georgia Fallaw, Rincon, Ga.

What
an emotional interview about the movie “8 Days.” I, and probably most of my
friends who are Christian, can’t conceive of what’s going on. This is the best
article I’ve read on sex trafficking. 
I
pray I don’t close this and go on about my life without doing more to stop this
awful crime. Thank you again for putting this out for us to realize the reality
of what’s happening.—Gail Smith, Franktown,
Colo.

Wonderful podcast with filmmaker Jaco Booyens. He voiced so much of what I think has happened to our society, but I don’t know the words to express it.
God will bless his work and may save our country.—Carol Swartzendruber, Syracuse, Ind.
Dear Daily Signal: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s ceremonial signing of the articles of impeachment against President Trump was hilarious (“What to Know About Democrats’ 7 Impeachment Managers” ). Pelosi deserves a Screen Actors Guild card from Hollywood for that podium solemnity performance as she introduced the House’s impeachment managers.
Alas, we had the privilege of witnessing the second act unfold as Pelosi passed out that plethora of pens, engraved with her name, to those impeachment managers as each appeared to be a dutiful little boy or girl awaiting pieces of candy from teacher.
Then
there was Act 3 as Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., and the rest of the Pelosi
scrum stood giggling, snickering, and smiling during
the media photo op. Priceless! 
Act
4, the best, was topped off by that hilarious yet bizarre
looking “perp walk” featuring the stiffly postured merry little band
of Democrat soldiers marching their impeachment articles to
the Senate.—Earl
Beal, Terre Haute, Ind.
***
Trey Gowdy, former Republican congressman from South Carolina, recently came out with another view on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s impeachment tactics. I believe he’s spot on.
During the Senate impeachment trial, senators are not allowed to campaign. Therefore, Gowdy theorizes, Pelosi held the articles of impeachment long enough so that if they could get any kind of delay in the Senate for even limited witnesses, those Republican senators who are up for reelection would not be home campaigning but be stuck in the Senate trial. 
Gowdy
theorizes that Pelosi didn’t hold the articles of impeachment for fear of them not
being enough to convict and remove President Trump; she knows there’s no way
it’s going to happen.
Therefore, her true reason, Gowdy says,  is to do her maximum effort to take back the Senate. Should Democrats do that, she basically could cripple Trump for his second term.
I
believe Pelosi has this in mind. Anyone who could arm-twist and cajole the
House at all hours of the day and night, weekends, calling them back into
session and so on, and get Obamacare passed, easily could concoct a plan such
as this.
Senate
Majority Leader Mitch McConnell must get the trial over in just days, not weeks.
No testimony, everyone knows it’s useless, and don’t worry about being called
unfair. 
Try to
appease the critics on this impeachment proceeding, and the Republicans might just
end up losing the Senate. That’s unconscionable.—Stuart B. Harnden, Bedford, N.H. 
  
The Iranians are at it again. They blame Trump for what their air defense network did to neutralize a Ukrainian commercial airliner departing Tehran, killing 176.
Of all things to now do, Rep. Jackie Speier of California, the mainstream print media, and left-wing talking heads blame President Trump for this tragedy.  With hostilities between the United States and Iran escalating, Iranian airspace should have been closed to all commercial air traffic. But the Iranians left it open. 
Commercial
aircraft possess operational transponder systems that propagate coded
signals to ground-based radar systems, differentiating aircraft as friend or
foe. These patterns are not raw data returns, as would be
the case when emitted from hostile aircraft or incoming missiles. 
Simply stated, the Iranians blew it by failing or refusing to acknowledge the airliner’s coded-signal radar returns. One must conclude from Iran’s initial lies that the regime’s compliance with the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal agreement with the West is questionable.
But
now Democrats and vacuous media types extend favor to Iran. Their
incessant referrals to a killer, Qassim Suleimani, as an individual
who was revered and loved by the Iranian people is an
abomination. 
The
time has arrived for patriotic Democrats and media types to stand
by the president in these times of geopolitical and
strategic challenges thrust upon the United States by
those who fervently yearn to bring this nation to its knees.—Earl Beal, Terre
Haute, Ind. 
***
One point of proper terminology: We didn’t “assassinate” a legitimate, respected Iranian general named Qassim Suleimani. 
Suleimani was a terrorist in charge of killers, not an actual army representing a lawful nation. His Quds Force operation was centered around Hezbollah and illegally occupied many nations while illegally murdering (mostly) Muslim civilians.
Even if Suleimani were a legitimate general and recognized as such by all other nations, since he was conducting his own war and murdering civilians wherever he felt like it, his killing by the U.S. would be called a casualty of war, not an assassination.
I’d sure appreciate it if we’d stick to time-honored terminology and stop using the left’s eulogies and terms for their heroes. It makes any good American sick.—Craig Brougher, Independence, Mo.
Dear Daily Signal: I was glad to see a documentary has been made about the life of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and read your article with great interest (“Clarence Thomas Skewers Joe Biden, ’91 Hearings in New Documentary”).

Editor’s note: Jarrett Stepman’s report from a conference of socialists over Fourth of July weekend in Chicago prompted a huge response from The Daily Signal’s audience. Here’s a sampling.—Ken McIntyre
Dear Daily Signal:  Anyone who wants to understand why American political life is so debased should consider what socialist influences have done to our public schools; that’s my response to Jarrett Stepman’s commentary (“I Went to a Socialism Conference. Here Are My 6 Observations).”
The promises are
relentlessly upbeat and even humanistic. The reality is always more decay, more mediocrity, more people prevented
from reaching their potential.
My thesis is that public
schools are the political reality served up billboard-size. Everyone can
understand if they bother to look. 
For example, public
schools claim to teach reading, but we have 50 million functional illiterates.
That’s socialism in action, also known as liberalism, progressivism,
collectivism, communism.
The claims are always gimmicks to gain more power. The claims are always without sincere intent. This is the part that the ordinary citizen has trouble with: The people at the top promise things they never intend to deliver.

Commies lie. Expect it.—Bruce Deitrick Price, Virginia Beach,

Dear Daily Signal: When I was stationed with the Army in West Germany, a friend and I talked with an East German man in, of all places, the German Alps in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. 
The man had escaped from East Germany and was running from the KGB. His description of life behind the Berlin Wall was not inspiring to us free American soldiers, or the German civilian.
These
are the stories the “new” Americans need to hear. There is no benefit
to surrendering our liberty and freedoms to a tyrannical government. 
There
is nothing free without someone paying the cost. Freedom is not free. Look at
Arlington National Cemetery. 
I
was trained in the Army to eliminate communist and socialist fighters. I never
imagined I might have to use that training in the land that I love and swore to
die for. 
Communism
is destructive and only beneficial to those who are in control. They are also
some of the richest people. What say, Bernie, Obama, Pelosi? 
Come
what may, I will defend my community and country against any attack on our
Constitution and our freedoms.—Gary Sackman
***
All communist, Marxist, fascist, socialist teaching in government schools needs to be removed, tenure or not. Best way to do that is to pass a school voucher system like the ones used it Switzerland, so parents can determine which schools educate their kids. 
End
tenure. End the National Education Association. That should get these people
dropped from our schools. Get our kids away from the communists infecting them.

Also,
if we can, get President Trump re-elected along with a supermajority of fiscal
conservatives in both the House and Senate. We need to return the true American
history, all of it, to the classroom from kindergarten to college.
And
the Constitution must be stressed in all public schools, not just our military
academies, which are currently the only colleges teaching it. We must take back
the minds of our young.—Theresa Rodriguez

Socialism,
what a joke. I think it was in 1984 that a client sent me to Milan, Italy. I
was put up in a very nice expensive hotel, the Principe di Savoia. 
Just
checking online, a room for two adults for one night currently starts at £280 ($350)
and goes up to £4,000 ($4,999). It’s not basic lodging. 
When
I was there, an international socialists’ conference was underway at the hotel.
I know because I asked the concierge who were all the people in blue Mao
jackets and military fatigues milling around in the public spaces. 
There
were hundreds of them, including someone the bartender told me was Moammar Gadhafi’s brother, enjoying a drink with
his very large shillelagh-carrying bodyguard. 
Socialists
sure know how to choose a good hotel. But then of course, they aren’t paying
for it.—Edward Vix

these communists want social justice? Well, what about some social justice for

sort of retribution? 
And
who see enormous amounts of money they worked to earn confiscated so the
government can give it to those who don’t work, those who are trying to destroy
all these Americans believe in, and those who support causes these Americans
find abhorrent? 
What
about those who obey the laws being ignored or even excoriated by those who
disregard the laws? What about some justice for them?—Maude

Dear Daily Signal: These are cowardly, pampered whiners who have reaped all the benefits of a free, capitalistic society but have taken it all for granted and are now offended by it. 
I doubt any of these
spoiled malcontents ever had to support themselves, let alone a family. It’s a
lot different when you have to work to support yourself and a family than it is
when everything you want and need is provided to you by parents.
When you are struggling
to provide for yourself and your family and then have others who have no such
obligations tell you that you need to provide for millions of others, you start
to see things a little differently. 
Send these spoiled brats
to Cuba for a year or two, with no money from home. Have them live like the
average Cuban does. Let them see firsthand how Cuba treats its political
critics. Let them feel how Cuba treats those in mobs who wear masks and protest
their government.
If it’s so bad here, all they have to do is leave. Cuba is only 90 miles off the Florida coast. And Canada isn’t that far away and you can get there by car.—Drew Page

Dear Daily Signal: It’s hard to believe this is happening in the United States. 
Years
ago, socialists were shunned in our society. But now with the millennials—poorly educated in the history

socialism as if it were akin to social media, we face a terrible menace in the

So
if they think they want to be socialists, aka communists, then treat them to a

for six months or so.
Feed
them about a 1,000 calorie-a-day meal, with mostly bread and only water to
drink, no coffee. If someone doesn’t like it, separate that person from the
others, move him or her from the jail to someplace else for an attitude
adjustment. 
That

generation has never had to deal with hard times. They’ve always had it handed

All kidding aside, this
keeps up and at some point there’s gonna be a SHTF moment and only one of the

The road America is on diverges ahead and, as Robert Frost said, we will choose a path. Whether that choice is through a great awakening or apathy or bloodshed cannot yet be seen. 
The path we are currently on—growing debt, growing social programs, less restrictive immigration, not enforcing existing laws (immigration, drugs, voting), ignoring the Constitution in creating and enforcing new laws (firearms, property rights)—heads toward a cliff.—Neil Christie

"Multiple news outlets last week reported on a 2018 video recording in which two men with Ukrainian connections, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, apparently inform President Donald Trump that the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, was undermining his policy and asserting that he soon would be impeached. 
In response, Trump reportedly ordered: “Get rid of her.”
Unsurprisingly, this recording became part of the broader impeachment debate, which accuses Trump of abuse of power, even though Yovanovitch herself acknowledges that she “served at the pleasure of the president.” 
The Constitution vests the president with the authority to appoint ambassadors, with the Senate’s advice and consent. Although not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, the authority to remove officials is consistent with that authority, along with the president’s position as the head of the executive branch. 
Indeed,
although the removal power has a convoluted
and complex history, it is strongest where the president’s constitutional
authority—such as in the conduct of foreign affairs—is explicit and broad. 
Moreover,
Congress has explicitly endorsed the president’s authority to remove and
reassign ambassadors though the Rogers Act of 1924 and the Foreign Service Act
of 1980, which established the rules, mission, and parameters of the U.S.
Foreign Service. 
Indeed,
the U.S. Code (Title 22, Chapter
52, §3941(d)(2))
makes explicit that “Chiefs of mission, ambassadors at large, and ministers
serve at the pleasure of the President.”
Congress
was correct to support this authority. In addition to their diplomatic and
bureaucratic duties as head of a U.S. Embassy under the State Department, U.S.
ambassadors serve as the president’s personal representative to a foreign head
of state and government.
Ambassadors are understood to speak for the president, and for this reason, serve at the president’s discretion. A relationship of less than full confidence is incompatible with the role. 
In practical terms, if a president lacks faith in an ambassador, there will be a strong incentive to circumvent him or her, possibly sowing discord and confusion. 
The proper remedy, instead, is removal. Ideally, the president’s authority to remove ambassadors should empower the State Department by bolstering the president’s confidence that its officials will faithfully execute his policies. 
People
can disagree with the president’s tone or comportment, but it’s clear that
Yovanovitch had lost the president’s confidence. As such, he was perfectly
within his authority to call for her removal.

Greg Scott

@GScottSays

Greg Scott is director of media for The Heritage Foundation.
In an age of moral outrage and endless Twitter war, a more refreshing and hopeful vision of America’s future is a rare and welcome blessing. 
A new book, “American Restoration: How Faith, Family, and Personal Sacrifice Can Heal Our Nation,” by Timothy Goeglein and Craig Osten is just such a blessing, and it comes at an opportune time, having just celebrated our nation’s founding.
A History Channel TV series—also coincidentally called “American Restoration”—tells stories of antique-restoration experts from across the country “as they not only restore pieces of America’s history, but create new and awe-inspiring works from vintage items.” 
In much the same way as these antique hunters apply their craft to uncover the underlying beauty of pieces from our cultural past, Goeglein and Osten reintroduce readers to the treasures—some all but buried—of self-governance, civil society, and personal virtue that our Founders left us, presenting these treasures in their original brilliance with a bright finish for tomorrow’s retelling.   
While the authors don’t completely avoid “back in the good old days” sentimentality, they do openly acknowledge and lament the sins of our country’s history, many that linger still today. 
This balance allows two deeply patriotic men, who rightly see our country as a force for good, to urge readers to look ahead, rather than behind, and to re-embrace the ideas that have sustained history’s longest-surviving experiment in liberty without being shackled to a sanitized retelling of our past.
Each succinct chapter offers a panoramic flyover of some
of the crucial cultural, political, and spiritual issues facing our country. 
Most of the warnings are familiar—about dwindling
respect for religious freedom, free speech, and the sanctity of life, along
with a crumbling education system and an unraveling of America’s
Judeo-Christian consensus—but are foundational in understanding what problems
the authors mean to help us solve and how.
The strength that sets “American Restoration” apart from other offerings in the genre is its simple and practical advice. Instead of a garment-rending rehearsal of all that ails us, the authors instead elegantly and accessibly identify big problems and guide the reader to “own” their part in the American restoration. 
>>> Listen to or read Timothy Goeglein’s interview with The Daily Signal
Recalling former House Speaker Thomas “Tip” O’Neill’s famous maxim that “all politics are local,” the authors insist that all politics are really, really local. 
While they do believe that massive structural, spiritual, and cultural change is needed, Goeglein and Osten appeal to the reader to start from the inside, to inculcate virtue and character in the home with one’s own family, to love and fellowship with one’s neighbors, and to perform acts of service and mercy in one’s community. 
Instead of a revolution that razes existing institutions
from the top down, the authors envision a restoration that raises future
generations to make change for good from the bottom up.
The authors offer numerous
examples of Americans who have transformed their esteem for our republic into actions
intended to “keep it”—some quietly in their communities in small ways and some
at great personal and professional risk on the national stage. 
The authors themselves take some risks, as their
proposed remedies are truly countercultural. 
They warn that radical individualism and demands for the customization of everything will not create a nation of contented citizens who have gotten exactly what they want. They argue that this continued trend fosters greater
division and feeds contempt for those outside the “tribe.” 
To say in a most narcissistic age that self-fulfillment is not the ultimate end, but rather a toxic pursuit, may be a new and dangerous idea for a generation brought up on the idea that its every thirst must be slaked—and now. 
Goeglein and Osten urge readers to look inside
themselves not to inquire of their appetites, but to subordinate them in favor
of seeking good for their neighbors. We should restore virtue. We should even
raise our boys to be gentlemen. 
“Virtuous people are those who have learned to put the needs of others above their own, while moderating their behavior in a manner that keeps them from making poor moral choices that would not only negatively impact them, but would impact society as a whole,” they write.
Virtuous people, the authors say, are the key to
inaugurating the restoration of community, cohered by the “little platoons”
represented by strong families.
And this is where the authors say that Christians should
play a leading role. 
Regular attendees of biblically orthodox churches have not abandoned the model of family life that nurtures virtue. 
Additionally, churches represent some of the last remaining strong community-centric institutions. So, churches and their members have a special responsibility to reintroduce these blessings to a hurting world that desperately needs such a witness. 
In the final analysis, “American Restoration” is so hopeful because the authors’ “it starts with you” advice for cumulative cultural change at the most local level is so doable. 
And if enough Americans in their homes, churches, communities, and civic organizations make it their mission to reignite the spirit that made our nation that “shining city on the hill,” Goeglein and Osten are optimistic that we will indeed see an American restoration.

Congressional hearings were created to educate lawmakers so
they have knowledge before they pass bills or impeach a president. 
Not today. Today, hardly any education happens. 
During the President Donald Trump impeachment “testimony,” legislators tried to score points. At least five times, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., shut down criticism by shouting, “Gentleman is not recognized!” 
I get that politicians are eager for “face time”
in front of a larger audience, but I assumed they would at least try to learn things. Nope. 
Maybe they don’t want to ask real questions because they
fear looking as dumb as then-Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, did at a hearing on
Facebook. He asked Mark Zuckerberg, “How do you sustain a business model
in which users don’t pay for your service?” 
“We run ads,” smirked Zuckerberg. “I
see,” said Hatch. 
What’s obvious to most people somehow eludes the oblivious
“experts” in Congress. 
At another Facebook hearing, Congress grilled Zuckerberg
about his plan to launch an electronic currency called Libra. Zuckerberg said,
“I actually don’t know if Libra is going to work, but I believe it’s
important to try new things.” 
He was right. But instead of asking about technological or
economic implications of the idea, Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, asked Zuckerberg, of
the companies partnering with him, “how many are headed by women?” 
“Congressman, I do not know the answer,” replied
Zuckerberg. 
“How many of them are minorities?” asked Green.
“Are there any members of the LGBTQ+ community?” 
Green doesn’t want to learn anything. He wants to sneer and
score points. 
Politicians’ sloppy ignorance is extraordinary. Rep. Steve
King, R-Iowa, grilled Google CEO Sundar Pichai about iPhones, citing a story
about his granddaughter using one, leading Pichai to explain,
“Congressman, iPhone is made by a different company.” 
Today’s posturing is not what the Founders had in mind when they invented hearings in 1789. 
George Mason said members of Congress “possess
inquisitorial powers” to “inspect the Conduct of public
offices.” 
Yes! Investigate government. 
But today, they are more likely to threaten CEOs and bully
opponents. 
“Are you stupid?” then-Rep. Darrell Issa,
R-Calif., said to one witness. They want to showboat, not learn. Often, they
ask questions even when they know the answers. 
“Ms. DeVos, have you ever taken out a student
loan?” asked Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., of Education Secretary Betsy
DeVos. “Have any of your children had to borrow money?” 
Warren knows that DeVos is a billionaire, but she wanted to
score points with her fans. 
One of the louder showboaters today is self-proclaimed
socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. She asked Wells Fargo boss Tim
Sloan, “Why was the bank involved in the caging of children?” 
“We weren’t,” replied Sloan. 
Some of today’s hearings are useful in that we get to see
how absurd and ignorant our representatives can be. 
During a hearing on military personnel being stationed on
the island of Guam, Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Georgia, said, “My fear is that
the whole island will become so overly populated that it would tip over and
capsize.” Really. He said that. 
Then there was the time Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., chair
of the House Financial Services Committee, summoned bank CEOs to Washington and
demanded, “What are you guys doing to help us with this student loan
debt?!” 
“We stopped making student loans in 2007,” Bank of
America’s Brian Moynihan told her. 
“We actually ended student lending in 2009,” added
Citigroup’s Michael Corbat. 
“When the government took over student lending in 2010
… we stopped doing all student lending,” explained Jamie Dimon of
JPMorgan Chase. 
The chair of the Financial Services Committee didn’t even know that her own party kicked bankers out of the student loan business, insisting that government take over?! Apparently not. She is so eager to blame business for government’s mistakes that she didn’t research her own topic. 
The more I watch politicians, the more I hate them. 
Let’s give them less power.

Rachael Menosky is a research and administrative assistant for the Thatcher Center at The Heritage Foundation.
Aggression by Iran and trade with China may dominate U.S. foreign policy headlines, but a plan recently announced by Russia to increase its presence in the Arctic should command our attention.
The Northern
Sea Route Development Plan—known as Plan NSP—marks a 15-year effort by Russia
to strengthen its involvement in the Arctic by focusing on developing the
Northern Sea Route.
Plan NSP, approved by former Russian Prime
Minister Dmitry Medvedev on Dec. 21, “includes as
many as 84 points and covers a wide range of priorities, from the development
of needed infrastructure and building of new ships to the mapping of natural
resources and launch of new satellites and meteorological equipment.” 
The plan,
designed to make Russia more mobile, resourceful, and powerful in the Arctic, calls
for starting the project this year and completing it by 2035. 
The plan states that it is in accordance with the decree of the president of Russia, dated May 7, 2018, which declares that Russia needs to increase cargo flow through the Northern Sea Route by at least 80 million tons. 
In 2018, 18 million tons travelled across the coastline—an 80% increase from 2017. In 2019, 26 million tons of cargo passed through the area. With Plan NSP in place, land, air, and sea routes will become available for the transportation of both goods and people.
This should
not surprise anyone, because Russia in recent years has steadily increased its military
and economic presence in the Arctic in search of economic opportunity and
sought militarily to make the Arctic its own. In 2007, the Russians even planted their flag at the bottom of the Arctic Sea under
the North Pole.
In addition,
Russia has either renovated or built from scratch at least seven military bases in the region. It broadcast that Siberian huskies would be trained to pull military
personnel and equipment into areas where military vehicles cannot handle the
terrain and disclosed it planned to install an “air defense
dome” made of S-400 missiles all across the region. 
Although much
of Russia’s Arctic progress in the last few years has been dedicated to
security, Plan NSP focuses heavily on the potential for greater economic involvement in coming years.
The plan calls for a Northern Sea Route, which Russia hopes will become a boon
to a stagnant economy.
According to the plan, within the first half of this new decade, the Russian government will decide whether to continue building several rail lines across the country. By the end of 2022, the decision will be made whether to continue the Belkomur railway line that would link Perm in the Ural Mountains to the Arctic port city of Arkhangelsk. 
It also will decide on rail lines from Sosnogorsk to Indiga, from Sabetta to Novyj Urengoj that also could serve to boost Arctic commerce, as well as one that would run across the River Ob to Novy Urengoy and Nadym. The government also plans to finish the Murmansk Transport Hub, with a 46-kilometer railway and several port facilities all along the west of Kola Bay, by December of 2021. 
Four civilian
airports will be upgraded in the coming years: Amderma in the west and Pevek,
Chersky, and Keperveyem in the east. Additionally, a dredging operation in the
Gulf of Ob, scheduled to be completed in December 2021, will allow for larger
vessels to pass through.
Finally, perhaps the most significant aspect of the plan is the launch of at least 40 new Arctic vessels, including eight nuclear-powered icebreakers and 16 rescue and support ships by 2035. Some of these ships will be Lider-class ice breakers, allowing them to break through extremely thick Arctic ice and open wide enough shipping lanes for large commercial ships. 
Plan NSP also includes plans to upgrade several nuclear icebreakers and nuclear materials special-purpose vehicles. 
The United States and its Arctic allies would do well to closely follow not only Russian militarization of the Arctic, but also planned economic investments in the high north. The plan is an ambitious effort to expand Russia’s presence in the Arctic, but how much of that plan comes to fruition remains to be seen. 
What is clear is that the way the Arctic continues to drive Russian strategic thinking should concern the U.S. and its allies.

"The partisan nature of this particular impeachment will end up weakening not just Trump, but the office of the presidency. Pictured: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi addresses reporters Jan. 16 during her weekly news conference on Capitol Hill. (Photo: Mark Wilson/Getty Images)

@KayColesJames

Kay C. James is president of The Heritage Foundation. James formerly served as director of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management and as Virginia's secretary of health and human resources. She is also the founder and president of The Gloucester Institute.
Whether the American people yet realize it or not, the House’s handling of the impeachment of President Donald Trump has inflicted serious damage on America’s constitutional system of government and threatened the very safety of our nation.
The partisan nature of this particular impeachment will end up weakening not just Trump, but the office of the presidency. Every future president—Democrat and Republican—will be second-guessing his or her decisions to avoid crossing members of Congress and being threatened with impeachment based on the flimsiest of evidence.
The latest alleged revelations from former national security adviser John Bolton don’t change the fact that last week, both lead House impeachment manager Rep. Adam Schiff and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer admitted that the House voted to impeach the president without the evidence to prove he was guilty, demanding that the Senate call witnesses so they could do more evidence gathering.
When Congress uses impeachment as a political weapon, it has the potential of stripping an enormous amount of constitutional authority from the presidency and shifting it to Congress. The House has created a precedent where future executives will feel compelled to run major decisions by Congress before carrying them out—even decisions that are solely in the president’s purview.
The delay created while a president attempts to seek consent from Congress could cost American lives when quick, decisive actions are needed. Just think of the kind of havoc that could be wrought when such permission-seeking ends up delaying military action necessary to stop an attack on an American embassy, when it prevents counterterrorism measures required to thwart an imminent terrorist threat at home, or when it delays federal help to respond to a natural disaster threatening the lives of thousands of citizens.
The office of the president has suffered additional long-term harm when one considers that when Trump chose to invoke executive privilege to prevent his staff from testifying in the impeachment hearings, the House charged him with “obstruction of Congress.” 
The long-held legal tradition of executive privilege allows a president to receive the best and frankest advice with which to make critical governing decisions, giving him and his staff the freedom to fully explore all sides of an issue.
Throughout my career, I was blessed to work in senior positions in both state and federal government, and I will say that those deliberations can be very messy—but also very effective. 
To function effectively, a president needs the ability to consult confidentially with his closest advisers. Taking that privilege away severely limits a president’s ability to serve citizens, as his advisers will be deterred from providing frank advice for fear their communications will be shared with millions—including foreign powers and political adversaries—on the evening news.
If executive privilege is abused, Congress has the ability to take the president to court to challenge his claims. Yet the House failed to do that, perhaps surmising that, based on past precedent, the courts might disagree with it. 
Instead, the House decided to charge the president with obstruction of Congress, despite the fact that executive privilege is a tool that many presidents have used and that the Supreme Court repeatedly has affirmed. Impeaching a president for invoking executive privilege essentially guts this important tool.
The Constitution’s Framers were very concerned that impeachment would be used as a political weapon, as is happening today. They never meant it to be the “no-confidence vote” of parliamentary systems that create turmoil by changing leadership anytime such a vote is called. Impeachment was meant for presidents who engaged in crimes so grievous that removing them from office couldn’t wait until the next election.
With this impeachment, the House has threatened our very constitutional system, effectively turning presidents into mere puppets of Congress, rejecting the idea of a separate and co-equal branch of government. In doing so, the House has damaged the unique system of checks and balances the Framers crafted to prevent any one branch of government from becoming too powerful.
The House also has made the American people the casualties in the process. The mere threat of impeachment may be all that is needed to stop future presidents from implementing policies that they know are popular with the people but unpopular with the opposition party in the House. 
In the worst-case scenarios, presidents who become paralyzed in their decision-making about national security and natural disasters could end up putting Americans in harm’s way.
Only time will tell the extent of the damage that has been done.

@KenMac55

Ken McIntyre, a 30-year veteran of national and local newspapers, serves as senior editor at The Daily Signal and The Heritage Foundation's Marilyn and Fred Guardabassi Fellow in Media and Public Policy Studies. Send an email to Ken.
Editor’s note:  Kids of all ages are returning to school, and “We Hear You” is back from a summer hiatus. What could be more fitting than some of your letters on the state of public education? Remember to write us at [email protected]—Ken McIntyre
Dear Daily Signal: I’m writing with thoughts arising from Stephanie Curry’s commentary about Colorado public schools (“Colorado Sex Ed Bill Would Force Kids to Learn LGBT Ideology, Ban Talk of Abstinence”). “Free” comes with a price tag.
I graduated as valedictorian from a public school in Charlotte, North Carolina, in 1989. I completed a bachelor’s degree in political science from Davidson College and a master’s in public administration from UNC-Charlotte. 
In part because of my experiences in the public school system, we have chosen to educate our five children at home. 
It is my impression from observing families who normally would object to much of what goes on in state schools that they tolerate it because it is free. They’d rather have two or three  cars, a boat, trips to Europe, a larger home, and so on than pay the money necessary to place their children in a well-run private school, or take the time to homeschool them.
It isn’t
easy being with children 24/7, although I can say thanks be to God for giving
me the grace to do so, and now true joy in being able to. 
I’ve wondered, what might happen to state schools in terms of funding if there were to be a mass exit of their “customers” when enough parents got tired of letting the state indoctrinate their children?
Fewer
teachers would be needed, fewer facilities. Maybe this would lead to real change
in the bloated education bureaucracy. Of course, the government always finds
another way to spend money. 
But parents
must remember that free isn’t free. I believe our society is paying a massive
price for decades of godless teaching. Certainly this is not the case across
the board. 
However, when we surrender our children to these state-run institutions influenced so heavily by groups like Planned Parenthood, we can’t expect the content or outcome to be what we want. The problem is systemic and not particular programs.—Karen Cox, Waynesboro, Ga.
***
Dear Daily Signal: Do you know why such things as this sort of sex ed in public schools are happening in America and in most parts of the Western world (“2 California Moms Sound Alarm About Lewd Sex Ed Coming to Schools”)?  Isolation and lack of connection among people. 
No
one knows what is happening around them. Some do not care enough for moral
values and the sanctity of the human body.
I am
an immigrant in my mid-60s from an Asian country, who came to this country 17
years ago. The government of my country and politicians are very, very corrupt.

Yet I
can tell you that if something like this happened in our schools there or in
the Muslim countries, people are quite connected. The public would go after the
school board, and even beat up members who support such measures. 
In
contrast, I think that in the Western world those in power—though not as
corrupt as those in other countries—are bought off easily by big corporations
and rich political donors, and few know when it is done. 
It is a sad situation, but Americans are slumbering when the bad have become powerful. To protect the ruin of future generations, it will take good, patriotic journalists and a few parents like those you have interviewed to awake the sleeping giant.—S.F.
Dear Daily Signal: It’s unbelievable that local school boards would promote the curriculum  and provide the resources you describe (“2 California Moms Sound Alarm About Lewd Sex Ed Coming to Schools”). 
However, it’s a wake-up call about the sometimes subtle, almost subliminal practices resorted to in education today. Eventually, I suspect there will be a tax revolt in communities driven by the fact that property taxes that primarily fund local schools also have become confiscatory, and shortfalls paid through state and federal subsidies. 
More people every year are sending their kids to private schools or homeschooling at their own expense. It’s sad, universal public education has been a pillar of strength for America and is being seriously damaged.—Norm Mayall, Hatboro, Pa.

Dear Daily Signal: In an op-ed early this year in The Wall Street Journal headlined “Masculinity Isn’t a Sickness,” clinical social worker Erica Komisar wrote: “In my practice as a psychotherapist, I’ve seen an increase of depression in young men who feel emasculated in a society that is hostile to masculinity.”
Unfortunately,
the debate on the transgender bathroom issue is often phrased in such a
way that males, even boys, are portrayed as the antagonists. 
For instance, a commentary by Monica Burke in The Daily Signal shows a lack of concern for boys’ privacy and portrays them as predators (“Supreme Court Rejects Case on Transgender Bathrooms. Here’s Why It’s Still a Huge Issue”). 
But
the very case the article addresses (Doe v. Boyertown Area School District) wasn’t
even initially started by a girl. Alexis Lightcap joined the lawsuit
later. Here’s how the case actually started, according to Alliance
Defending Freedom:
“During
the 2016-17 school year—without informing parents or students—the Boyertown
Area School District opened its high school locker rooms and restrooms to
students of the opposite sex based on those students’ beliefs about their
gender. Some male students learned of the policy while they were undressing in
their locker room and discovered that a female student was changing clothes
with them. Embarrassed and confused, the students sought help from school
officials, who told them they should just ‘tolerate it’ and ‘make it as natural
as possible.’”
I
hope you would agree that open bathroom policies aren’t good for either gender.
Absolutely, girls and women should have privacy. But many boys and men also
have a sense of decency and privacy.
Here’s
another example of male students
having their privacy violated:
The
Fairbanks North Star Borough School District, in Alaska, disciplined a female
student who kneed a male student in the groin in April after he barged into the
girls’ restroom. That student was part of a group of seven male students who
entered the restroom in protest after a female student who identifies as a male
took a photo in the boys’ restroom and posted it on Snapchat.
People
got upset with the school district for disciplining the female student who
kneed the male student. But what about privacy for the male students who had
the biological female take a photo in the boys’ restroom? 
Who is standing up for boys’ privacy rights? Shouldn’t we be concerned for girls and boys? Please take these things into consideration for future stories.—Nathan Zoschke

Dear Daily Signal: These groups that don’t like history exposed, as in the case of the George Washington mural covered up in a San Francisco school, “send them back” to where they or their ancestors came from (“San Francisco School Board Votes to Paint Over George Washington Mural”). 
We have got to get strong against
these kooks. We can’t let them rule this country like they did their countries.
It all went to hell, then they fled to ours. 
Well, quit bitching. We have to come up with some tough laws.—Willie Bitz
***
Dear Daily Signal: In case you haven’t noticed, we have been on a progressive slide into socialism over the past 50 years (“She Survived China’s Forced Labor Camp. Now She’s Urging Americans to Reject Socialism”). The wolf is no longer at the door, it is now inside and savaging at will. 
Karl Marx would be pleased to see his philosophy so progressively entrenched in the USA. “From each according to his ability, to each according to his need” is now widely accepted and only faintly resisted. 
The Daily
Signal falls clearly in the faint resistance camp.
Big government: check. Progressive taxes: check. Food stamps: check. 
Subsidized
housing: check. Subsidized medical: check. Subsidized education: check. 
Merit
trashing: check. National debt of $23 trillion: check. 
The list goes on, but it is crystal clear that our country is in a severe crisis mode, set on a path to destruction. 
Marx, Mao, Lenin, and Castro are all smiles with a big high-five celebration as the global elites join hands embracing world domination.—David Harned
***
Dear Daily Signal: Regarding Kevin Mooney’s reporting, before government hijacked education in our nation, we had a wonderfully successful public education system (“New Jersey Parents to Rally Against LGBT Education Law”).
Now
retired, I volunteer at a museum in our community that attracts hundreds of
guests from every country on the globe in addition to every state and province
in North America. 
With
exposure to so many guests, it amazes me how many U.S. citizens actively opt to
homeschool their children rather than send them to public schools. Not only do
these homeschooled children get a better education, it includes what actually
happened in history instead of the rewritten agenda.
Also
eliminated are the cost of child care with moms staying home, bullying in the
classroom, and threats of school shootings and other violence. 
Ultimately,
our government-managed public education system would appear destined to self-destruct,
eventually to be replaced by parents’ adopting higher quality homeschooling
programs associated with reduced costs and increased safety.
If we are to have affordable, commonsense programs, the private sector and/or individual citizens excel while government-run programs always falter due to misguided policies.—Ron Dale, Boise, Idaho
***
Dear Daily Signal: Per Lee Edwards’ article on socialism, 50% of students polled say they think socialism is good and capitalism bad (“3 of the Most Telling Failures of Socialism”). Most come out confirmed leftists. Why? 
The single
biggest enemy of America is the current public (government) school system, from
kindergarten through college. (Plus the media, but that’s another story.)
It’s the
schools that teach kids to like socialism and hate capitalism. Russia and
China together could never have undermined and hurt the U.S. as much as our
education system.  
The Daily
Signal should do an article on how the system trains and indoctrinates students
to be leftists, to like socialism, and to hate America. 
How do these
teachers get away with it? Who establishes the curriculum in public
schools, and what exactly is that curriculum? Why isn’t conservatism being
taught as well? How can we change the system to be more balanced and
pro-American?
If the education
system doesn’t change, America is lost. A World War II veteran—who won every
battlefield medal offered and fought in all five of the major European
campaigns—told me, “America
is disintegrating.”
I didn’t believe him then, but I do now. The schools are causing it.—Rob Zache, Verona, Wis.
How Are We Doing?
Dear Daily Signal: Articles provided by The Daily Signal are often quite informative and very timely, and offer insight into what is taking place in Washington on a daily basis.   As these articles cannot certainly cover all the specifics about legislation which is being written about, I’d like to recommend that articles pertaining to legislation include the House of Representatives (HR) and/or Senate (S) number so that the reader can go to congress.gov to read the actual legislation.   All too often an article is very interesting, but trying to find the related legislation for further reading is trying and cumbersome, as congress.gov is not very user-friendly. Having clarity by citing in text the specific HR and/or S number of the bill would be quite welcomed.—Dan Cutter

Please block comments beneath your articles that contain
profane or foul language. To some of us this is still very offensive. Profanity

It is time to stop this intrusion into intellectual discussion. FYI, my high school counselor told me that swearing showed a lack of vocabulary.
Thank you for offering this opportunity to tell you how many

"The word democracy appears nowhere in our nation's two most fundamental documents, the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution. 
 (Photo: Getty Images)

Walter E. Williams

@WE_Williams

Walter E. Williams is a columnist for The Daily Signal and a professor of economics at George Mason University.
During President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial, we’ll hear a lot of talk about our rules for governing. One frequent claim is that our nation is a democracy. 
If we’ve become a democracy, it would represent a deep betrayal of our Founders, who saw democracy as another form of tyranny. 
In fact, the word democracy appears nowhere in our nation’s two most fundamental documents, the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution. The Founders laid the ground rules for a republic as written in the Constitution’s Article IV, Section 4, which guarantees “to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government.”
John Adams captured the essence of the difference between a democracy and republic when he said, “You have rights antecedent to all earthly governments; rights that cannot be repealed or restrained by human laws; rights derived from the Great Legislator of the Universe.” 
Contrast the framers’ vision of a republic with that of a democracy. In a democracy, the majority rules either directly or through its elected representatives. As in a monarchy, the law is whatever the government determines it to be. Laws do not represent reason. They represent power. The restraint is upon the individual instead of the government. 
Unlike that envisioned under a republican form of government, rights are seen as privileges and permissions that are granted by government and can be rescinded by government.
Here are a few quotations that demonstrate the contempt that our Founders held for a democracy. James Madison, in Federalist Paper No. 10, wrote that in a pure democracy, “there is nothing to check the inducement to sacrifice the weaker party or the obnoxious individual.” 
At the 1787 Constitutional Convention, Edmund Randolph said that “in tracing these evils to their origin every man had found it in the turbulence and follies of democracy.” 
Alexander Hamilton agreed, saying: “We are now forming a republican government. [Liberty] is found not in “the extremes of democracy but in moderate governments. … If we incline too much to democracy, we shall soon shoot into a monarchy.”
John Adams reminded us: “Remember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There was never a democracy yet that did not commit suicide.” 
John Marshall, the highly respected fourth chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, observed, “Between a balanced republic and a democracy, the difference is like that between order and chaos.” 
Thomas Paine said, “A Democracy is the vilest form of Government there is.” 
The framers gave us a Constitution replete with undemocratic mechanisms. One constitutional provision that has come in for recent criticism is the Electoral College. In their wisdom, the framers gave us the Electoral College as a means of deciding presidential elections. That means heavily populated states can’t run roughshod over small, less-populated states. 
Were we to choose the president and vice president under a popular vote, the outcome of presidential races would always be decided by a few highly populated states, namely California, Texas, Florida, New York, Illinois, and Pennsylvania, which contain 134.3 million people, or 41% of our population. 
Presidential candidates could safely ignore the interests of the citizens of Wyoming, Alaska, Vermont, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and Delaware. Why? They have only 5.58 million Americans, or 1.7% of the U.S. population. 
We would no longer be a government “of the people.” Instead, our government would be put in power by and accountable to the leaders and citizens of a few highly populated states. It would be the kind of tyranny the framers feared.
It’s Congress that poses the greatest threat to our liberties. The framers’ distrust is seen in the negative language of our Bill of Rights such as: Congress “shall not abridge, infringe, deny, disparage, and shall not be violated, nor be denied.” 
When we die and if at our next destination we see anything like a Bill of Rights, we know that we’re in hell because a Bill of Rights in heaven would suggest that God couldn’t be trusted.

"A 2017 Supreme Court decision suggests that there might be as many as seven judges on the same side of this decision about religious schools and tax credits. (Photo: Getty Images)
Should families be able to use school choice tax credits on religious schools? That’s the question that’s at the heart of Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue, which the Supreme Court is hearing Wednesday. Heritage Foundation legal scholar and host of the podcast “SCOTUS 101” Elizabeth Slattery breaks down the case for us. Read a lightly edited transcript of her interview, or listen on the podcast:

Daniel Davis: Well, it’s a big day at the Supreme Court, where the justices are hearing arguments in a case involving religious schools. The case is Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue. Joining me to break it down is Elizabeth Slattery, a legal fellow here at The Heritage Foundation. Elizabeth, thanks for coming in.
Elizabeth Slattery: Thanks for having me.
Davis: So this case is out of Montana. What exactly is the dispute over?
Slattery: Back in 2015, the Montana Legislature set up this tax-credit scholarship program that would provide scholarships for income-eligible children to use at qualified schools, private schools. 
Initially, recipients could use the scholarship funds at any qualified school, including religious ones. But then the Montana Department of Revenue implemented a rule to exclude religious schools, citing a provision in the Montana Constitution that bars state funds from aiding religious organizations. 
Parents were relying on these funds to send their children to religious schools and they sued in state court. And that is the case that’s up at the Supreme Court.
Davis: So, the state Supreme Court ruled according to the state Constitution, but I’m assuming the Supreme Court is going to have something to say about the U.S. Constitution. Do you think the two might be in conflict here?
Slattery: Yeah. So, the parents raised federal constitutional claims in addition to some state law issues. And what the Montana Supreme Court ended up ruling was, it struck down the tax-credit program in its entirety. 
It said that, “Look, when the Legislature set this up, they were allowing funds to go to religious schools and our Constitution says that you can’t do that.” And so they struck down the program in its entirety. So no children can use the scholarship program right now.
Davis: You’ve written that the Supreme court’s recent ruling in the Trinity Lutheran case from 2017 might be relevant here as a precedent to maybe correct this ruling or overturn it. Can you explain that?
Slattery: Sure. Trinity Lutheran was a case out of Missouri from back in 2017. And that case involved a day care center that was run by a church. And they wanted to apply for this state-funded grant to help them resurface the playground at the day care center. But they were denied the grant solely because it was brought by a religious institution. 
Missouri, likewise, has what’s called a no-aid [amendment] or a Blaine Amendment. Some people call them that in their state constitution. And this case went all the way to the Supreme Court. And the court held that Missouri had violated the federal Constitution by discriminating against an organization solely on the basis of religion.
Davis: So the parents in this Montana case, they’re going to argue the same thing. They’re going to say that this tax credit is a generally available public benefit and that, therefore, they should be able to use it to go toward religious schools?
Slattery: Yeah. And there’s an additional wrinkle here, particularly with regard to the no-aid provision because what we’re talking about here is a tax credit. So it isn’t actually state money that’s flowing to the schools. It’s people giving money to a scholarship-granting organization and then the money goes into the hands of a private actor or the parents to decide where to use that money. 
And the Supreme Court, the U.S. Supreme Court has long held that there’s a distinction between direct government funding of religion and indirect funding such as a tax credit, in this case.
Davis: Zooming out, big picture, what’s really at stake in this case for other Americans who aren’t involved in this particular case?
Slattery: Between 37 and 38 states have similar no-aid provisions in their constitutions. And many of these states enacted these no-aid provisions. 
They’re also called Blaine Amendments … named for Sen. James Blaine, who tried to get the federal Constitution amended to prevent funds from going to what he called “sectarian” schools. And this was a code word for Catholic schools because he didn’t want funding of Catholic institutions or Catholic schools. 
A number of states have these amendments. So you can see … in the Montana case how they can conflict with school choice efforts. And really this case is about just trying to allow parents to decide what the best educational opportunity is for their children and using programs like this tax-credit program to give their kids the best education that they can.
Davis: Right now the court is considered conservative by a 5-4 majority. What outcome should we expect from this case?
Slattery: Well, if we look at the Trinity Lutheran case from a couple of terms ago, that’s when Justice [Neil] Gorsuch had just joined the Supreme Court. Justice [Anthony] Kennedy was still on the bench. So we have switched Kennedy for [Justice Brett] Kavanaugh. But that was a 7-2 ruling. 
So Justices [Elena] Kagan and [Justice Stephen] Breyer joined with the so-called conservative members of the court to uphold the First Amendment and to find that what the state of Missouri had been doing was religious discrimination. So we could see a similar breakdown in this case. 
Justice [Sonia] Sotomayor wrote a dissent back in Trinity Lutheran and Justice [Ruth Bader] Ginsburg joined her saying that they thought that the Trinity Lutheran case weaken the separation of church and state. But we’ll see what happens in this one.
Davis: And then with Kavanaugh, I would assume he’s even more likely to go conservative in this case?
Slattery: Based on his jurisprudence from the D.C. Circuit and the limited jurisprudence we have from the Supreme Court, he has been strongly in line with the conservatives when it comes to establishment clause and other First Amendment cases. So it’s hard to predict how cases are going to turn out because you never know what might happen. But I think that there is affirm majority that will rule to side with the parents in this case.
Davis: If that happens, does that automatically amend the other state constitutions that currently ban this practice?
Slattery: Not necessarily. So, the parents in the Montana case have argued that as the state court applied the constitutional provision, it violates the federal Constitution. But they can see that there could be other applications of this provision that are in line with the federal Constitution. 
Now, interestingly enough, the Trump administration filed a “friend of the court” brief supporting the parents in the Montana case. And they say that these no-aid provisions should be struck entirely, but the parents who are the litigants in the case didn’t go quite that far in what they were asking the Supreme Court to do.
Davis: When should we expect the ruling?
Slattery: It’ll be by the end of June most likely. That’s when the court will wrap up for this term. And they have been issuing opinions, some of the ones from the fall setting. 
I think since this is going to be argued in January, we may not see an opinion until maybe April at the earliest. But it may not be until the very end, which is the last week of June.
Davis: All right. Well, we’ll wait to see how the arguments go. If you want to listen to more of Elizabeth’s analysis of cases like this, check out her podcast “SCOTUS 101.” Elizabeth, thanks for your time today.
Slattery: Great to be here.

Walter E. Williams

@WE_Williams

Walter E. Williams is a columnist for The Daily Signal and a professor of economics at George Mason University.
It’s nearly impossible to have even a short conversation with a college administrator, politician, or chief executive without the words diversity and inclusion dropping from their lips. 
Diversity and inclusion appear to be the end-all and be-all of their existence. So, I thought I’d begin this discussion by first looking up the definition of diversity.  
Here’s my question to those who are wedded to diversity and inclusion: Are people better off the less they have in common with one another? 
For example, women are less likely to be able to march 12.4 miles in five hours with an 83-pound assault load. They are also less likely to be able to crawl, sprint, negotiate obstacles, and move a wounded comrade weighing 165 pounds while carrying that load. 
Would anyone argue that a military outfit would benefit from diversity by including soldiers who can and those who cannot march 12 miles in five hours while carrying an 83-pound load?
According to the Oxford Dictionary, diversity is “the practice or quality of including or involving people from a range of different social and ethnic backgrounds and of different genders, sexual orientations, etc.” 
The definition gratuitously adds, “equality and diversity should be supported for their own sake.” 
The standard definition given for inclusion is involvement and empowerment where the inherent worth and dignity of all people are recognized. 
You say, “Williams, the military is an exception!” 
What about language? 
The International Civil Aviation Organization has decreed that all air traffic controllers and flight crew members engaged in or in contact with international flights must be proficient in the English language as a general spoken medium. 
According to the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, there are about 7,000 languages in the world. The International Civil Aviation Organization could promote language inclusiveness by requiring language rotation. 
Some years, Cebuano (of the Malayo-Polynesian language family) and in other years Kinyarwanda (of the Niger-Congo language family) could be the language of pilots and air traffic controllers. 
Keep in mind that it is claimed that the great benefit of diversity and inclusiveness is that it promotes and fosters a sense of belonging. It values and practices respect for the differences in the talents, beliefs, backgrounds, and ways of living of its members.
Another issue is what should be done when people who should know better praise non-diversity and non-inclusiveness? 
Civil rights leader Rev. Jesse L. Jackson said, “I applaud commissioner Adam Silver’s commitment to diversity and inclusion within the NBA.” 
During the 2018-2019 season, more than 33% of NBA teams had head coaches of color. The number of assistant head coaches of color was over 42%. The number of black NBA players was 82%. 
In the face of these statistics, Oris Stuart, the NBA’s chief diversity and inclusion officer said, “Diversity, inclusion, and equality are central to every aspect of our game and our business.” 
I would like for Jackson and others who claim that there’s racial diversity and inclusiveness in professional basketball to make their case. The same question can be asked about professional football where 70% of NFL players are black, and 9% of team head coaches are black. 
The thornier question and challenge is what can be done to make professional basketball and football look more like the American population?
Most of the diversity and inclusiveness insanity has its roots in academia. 
An example is a paper titled “Equilibrium Grade Inflation with Implications for Female Interest in STEM Majors,” written by Naval Postgraduate School professor Thomas Ahn, Duke University economics professor Peter Arcidiacono, Duke University researcher Amy Hopson, and James R. Thomas of the Federal Trade Commission.
The authors argue that science, technology, engineering, and mathematics programs at colleges and universities lacking female enrollment can be attributed largely to harsh grading policies in these fields. 
Their solution to increase the number of women’s involvement in STEM is to standardize grading curves, in order to grade less “harshly.” The insanity of this approach is to not only weaken standards for women but to weaken standards across the board. 
This is more evidence that George Orwell was absolutely right when he said, “There are some ideas so absurd that only an intellectual could believe them.”

@KenMac55

Ken McIntyre, a 30-year veteran of national and local newspapers, serves as senior editor at The Daily Signal and The Heritage Foundation's Marilyn and Fred Guardabassi Fellow in Media and Public Policy Studies. Send an email to Ken.
Editor’s note: We’re back with a roundup of your emails, beginning with one on the state of public schools from a correspondent who recently moved from California to Virginia. Don’t forget to write us at [email protected]—Ken McIntyre
Dear Daily Signal: About your “Back to School Edition” roundup of reader comments: I served on a consultative diocesan school board in Southern California from 1999 to 2019. We moved to Virginia when our youngest was enrolled in a college in Michigan. I’ve stayed reasonably active in civic affairs. 
While our kids were still in public
schools, first in Long Beach and then Newport Beach, California, the singular
thing that separated the two K-6 schools in each community was the
preponderance of “whole families” in Long Beach and mostly white, single-parent
families in Newport Beach. 
The small Long Beach school allowed
inner-city kids to commute to the school if they came from a home with two parents.
It was some sort of deal that had been arranged with the school district, and
the imported students made the attendance numbers work and the little
neighborhood school viable. It was a wonderful school.
In contrast was the K-6 school on
the sand in Newport. Totally out of control, poorly administered. We stuck
there for over a year and then bolted to a Catholic parish school on the advice
of some new friends. I eventually caught the attention of the LaSallian brother
who served as superintendent, and was invited on his board. 
The traditional model for Catholic
parish schools is 35 pupils in a class. That number floats the boat
economically, and in schools throughout the country has been part of what
filled the freshman classes at places such as University of Notre Dame and
Gonzaga University. 
With all the babble in California about reduced class sizes in public schools, it didn’t take long for parents in the parish school to start voicing concern that 35 was just too many kids. There was an effect, and it wasn’t positive. 
The other matter was “credentialed”
teachers. I know of at least three persons at the parish school where our kids
attended who did not have a teaching credential. They were the most effective
teaching professionals I’ve ever met. 
But once that news spread to the
families at the parish school, the die was cast. The teachers were released. 
There is another matter of
“formation” that goes missing in many Catholic schools these days. The teachers
are mostly formed in the
public university education programs. Need I go on?
Where we live now in Virginia is the belly of the beast, so to speak. (Do you recognize the name Gavin Grimm?) Although the county is small (population 37,000), there are five K-6 schools, two middle schools, and one high school. The district enrollment is declining, but nonteaching staff is increasing. 
At public meetings, unionized
teachers rise to talk on the subject of salaries and pay increases. The
complaint is that they need more money in order to live. Throughout the county
are signs boasting “we’re hiring” and other messages to entice job seekers for
positions with businesses of varying size and type. 
The schools have some positions open
even while they concede falling enrollment. Recently there were 22 open
positions but only three were classroom instructors and one was a substitute. 
They have an entire K-6 campus that
used to be a segregated school, but is used now for various state and federally
funded programs for students who have “special” needs and so on. It also
serves for the superintendent staff offices and district administrative offices
and the miscellany of a bureaucratic swamp. It has an amazingly full parking
lot. 
Many comments on The Daily Signal bemoan
the struggle we’re having over the move toward socialism versus a free market
economy. 
Anyone thinking about homeschooling
needs to attend a school board or board of supervisors meeting in my little
corner of the world. Listen carefully to the bilge that angry teachers spew in
favor of pay increases divorced from the product of their efforts: a learned
pupil, honest and prepared to meet the challenges of a competitive society. 
Parents need to get their kids out of there. Thanks for your efforts at The Heritage Foundation.—Ken Larson, Virginia
Here are answers to some common questions about ‘red flag’ gun laws. https://t.co/ffGSxVr5Fa via @AmySwearer @DailySignal
Pondering Red Flag Laws
Dear Daily Signal: I was extremely disappointed in The Daily Signal for supporting and trying to convince the general public that an infringement of their constitutional rights without due process is a good thing. 
I have a number of issues with Amy Swearer’s commentary on red flag laws (“Answers to Common Questions About ‘Red Flag’ Gun Laws”), and obviously she has no problem with secret court hearings and restricting someone’s rights without probable cause or evidence beyond a reasonable doubt. 
The
author talks about the family of the Arizona shooter and how they tried to hide
his guns. Why didn’t the family take the guns away? Why is it that
everyone for some reason thinks it is the government’s responsibility to do
everything for someone? 
Civil
commitments are a long and intensive process because the state is looking at
restricting someone’s rights when he or she hasn’t committed any crime. It
should be long and intensive. But allowing anyone to go to court to say someone
else is a danger, and have a secret hearing, is where red flag laws fly in the
face of the Constitution, not only in terms of the Second Amendment but the
Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth.
Swearer
really thinks that the federal government will craft a law that is specific and
narrow in scope? Come on, be realistic. 
Saying
red flag laws are dangerous but not a big deal for law enforcement since they
face dangerous things every day is really shortsighted. 
The
author fails to mention that the man was killed by police when they arrived to
seize his guns without any due process. That officer now has to live with
the fact that he ended someone’s life. 
As
a retired officer, I know the job is difficult enough without having to add
seizing guns from some unsuspecting person. There are already courts looking at
officers being responsible for using force when needed if their actions pushed
the situation. 
Coming
to take someone’s guns is going to be an escalation of the situation. So are
these laws going to give officers immunity for the force they may need to use? 
Already
people complain about officers being too militarized. Well, when they are going
to have to go do a gun seizure they are going to need the SWAT team. Are the
media going to back off and let the officers do their job the safest way they
know how, or are they going to make a spectacle of officers again anytime they
are dressed to protect themselves?  
Please don’t pander by saying their jobs are dangerous anyway. That is a childish argument. How about you stand for the individual’s rights?—Traci Ciepiela 
***
 Amy Swearer’s commentary on the supposedly wonderful “red flag” laws is a sellout of the Constitution, and by association your sellout of same.
­­­Red flag laws allowing “Extreme Risk Protection Orders” flagrantly violate not just the Second Amendment but the Fourth and Fifth amendments. 
Swearer is advocating that people be deprived of their constitutional rights without probable cause and due process—and when you’ve opened that door, you’ve made it available to remove all of our other rights.
I’m ending my subscription as soon as I send this. You disgust me.—Steven Peter Yevchak Sr.
This and That 
Dear Daily Signal: First of all, I love viewing The Daily Signal’s articles and videos, which offer a different perspective than I’m hearing from most media outlets. So thank you for all you do.
I live in Orange County, California,
which until recently was a bastion of conservative thinkers. I read The Orange
County Register for a portion of my daily news. While the Editorial Page staff
is mostly conservative in its views, I’m noticing a heavy bias in national news
stories presented in the paper.  
It appears that local new stories are
covered by staff at the paper, but most or all national news stories are obtained
from the Associated Press. Time and time again, while reading news stories
about significant national events, it appears that only one side to the story is
presented by the Associated Press.  
Just this morning, I read an article on immigration titled “Trump: Detain Children Longer.” There was not one quote or argument made in favor of the president’s position for taking this approach, even though I know there are arguments to be made.
Why am I not getting both sides of the
story from the Associated Press?  Is this
common for a local paper to use the AP for all of its national news?
While I have heard plenty of examples of bias in network TV news and newspapers like The New York Times, I have never seen a story about the AP. Can someone please write about it? —Greg S. Johnstone, Ladera Ranch, Calif.
***
Dear Daily Signal: The story of Canton, Mississippi, is certainly bad, but not the worst we face in the future (“There’s a Silver Lining to the Voter Fraud Scandal in Mississippi”). California, New York, and other states are giving driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants. They will flood our voting booths.
Voters across our nation are being misinformed on who to vote for through fake news media, the internet, and social media. Even the candidates misinform the public with false promises, just to get votes. 
A voter should be educated and well informed to vote, but now
there are calls to lower the voting age.  We are doomed.
Congress needs to pass a law that no political ads can be made on
social media platforms. This would help eliminate fraudulent ads and bogus ads
from foreign powers.—Pat
Ellis, Clinton, Miss.
***
Dear Daily Signal: It’s about time  judicially approved removal orders are executed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement against illegal aliens living their good lives in the United States. 
Those
under legal deportation order via enforceable federal immigration law under
the Immigration and Naturalization Act have received their due process of
law, whether under the Fifth or 14th amendments. 
Those
sought by the government for deportation have had their claims and asylum
applications before a judge denied, but defied these court holdings and decided to
remain in the United States in violation of the law. To
these individuals, it’s time to leave.
For
the bleeding hearts who concern themselves with the welfare of those attempting
to enter the U.S. from Africa, Asia, Central America, and Mexico over the
plight of homeless and military veterans permanently injured from war,
immigration law as established by your Congress is the law, like it or
not.
Presidents ranging back to the mid-1970s failed miserably in dealing with the issue of illegal aliens. Whether you love or loathe President Trump, he is the only one to engage this issue with an element of Article 2 executive leadership on behalf of the American people.—Earl Beal, Terre Haute, Ind.
Each American Is $240,000 in Debt Because of Government Spending https://t.co/jLaXWQhobE @DailySignal #AAG
And Then Some…
Dear Daily Signal: Regarding your article on Social Security, why is nothing mentioned about how it has been robbed blind by politicians (“Each American Is $240,000 in Debt Because of Excessive Government Spending”)?
It was set up brilliantly. Except for allowing politicians to get their hands on the money, and paying Social Security benefits to those who never paid into it. 
Refunding Social Security should be a high priority. I would vote to knock the politicians’ salary back to the $15 an hour they seem to like for others, move their retirements to Social Security, and pay them per diem, with two weeks’ vacation per year.—Kathy Scott
***
 The country barely votes. We have 325 million people, but 120 million voting. The problem is not duplicate voting, but the absence of voting. 
The reason you should care is because those who do not vote will
eventually want their own country. If you want to marginalize over 100 million
people from voting and having their voices heard, sure, do that. 
But do realize that eventually, much like all other countries all over
the world, they are going to demand equal representation. You should be
advocating that everyone vote–I mean everyone.
What’s the matter, afraid of a little democracy? If you don’t like people voting, move to China and North Korea. Look at Australia, where everyone votes. It is the law.—Ali Khan

I just read the commentary “The Left Can’t Stop Lying About the Tea Party” by David Harsanyi, and I must say he has a gift with words. And “right on!” A neighbor insists that “Trump lies!”  I’ve not been able to get her to tell me what he’s lied about, but it must be coming from leftist “news” sources.—  Tim Gales
How Are We Doing?
Dear Daily Signal: Thank you very much for your insightful, thought-provoking analysis of current events. Your reports provide excellent guidance for class discussions and principled, foundational philosophy of citizenship for my students. 
I appreciate the diligent efforts of your staff. You are making a difference in America.—Brett Keefer
***
Don’t get sucked into identity politics. Seeing you add six new contributors is great, but the choice to feature their minority backgrounds in it is not great “The Daily Signal Adds 6 New Contributors”). 
As a whole, we cannot care what gender, ethnicity, or skin color people have. And that choice of image may easily be construed to mean that The Daily Signal does discriminate, whether for good or bad. Food for thought.—Slate Rehm
***
I find your organization to be of the same values and principles as I am. 
I recently watched Heritage Foundation President Kay Coles James
on CSPAN, and wanted to call right away to praise and encourage her for the
fantastic job she is doing. I highly commend Mrs. James for her spirit and am
so sorry for the past appalling horrific treatment of her ancestors. 
Please continue to do the great job your organization is doing for such a great cause. —Joanne Quina, Pensacola, Fla.
***
Praise for the knowledge brought by The Daily Signal. Agree or disagree, the articles are all well written. My comments are not so well written. In literacy in the English language, I will forever be challenged.
Brevity increases this challenge for me. Like Imprimis, even if I can’t read or absorb it entirely The Daily Signal gives me hope. To connect with intellects of integrity tells me over and over the value of debate, of an Irish pub and a pint of Guinness.—Mark McClure
***
Dear Daily Signal:  I started receiving The Daily Signal’s articles through a family friend.  I enjoy most of them. Hard-core leftist points of view definitely are offending and are a danger to our country, liberty, and our Constitution. 
We let the camel into the tent years ago and now the whole body has followed.  Time for real Americans to stand up.  We are the majority, not some fringe group like Antifa, or terrorists like the Muslim Brotherhood.  
This is our country, and it’s time to stand or fall to the communists and terrorists. I am a former soldier and will not let this happen to my community. Thanks for your articles.—Gary Sackman
***
Why call illegal aliens “immigrants”? They are not immigrants. They are thieves who have stolen the privilege of being able to live in the USA. Thieves should never be allowed to keep what they have stolen for themselves or their children.—Doug Wilkerson

 You folks are doing a wonderful thing. I know I can trust and believe what I read from you. God bless you!—Bruce Donahue
Superior news reporting.—Jim Keeler
Love to read your informative articles daily.—J.J. Weiland Excellent. Great job.—William G. Rosch III
Like your site, and put The Daily Signal first under “conservative” on my  Lookseek search engine.—Harold Hofmeister, Westwood, N.J.

Dear Daily Signal: Excellent commentary, as usual. Thank you for sharing the real story on so much of the half-true or even wholly false mainstream media versions.—Deborah G.

@JustinBogie

Justin Bogie is a senior policy analyst in fiscal affairs at The Heritage Foundation.
The Congressional Budget Office has released its budget and economic projections for fiscal years 2020-2030. 
The latest report confirms what the Congressional Budget Office
has been telling lawmakers for years: The nation is hurtling toward a spending-driven
debt crisis. 
Without major reforms to mandatory spending programs, it is
not a question of if, but when, all Americans will feel the financial impacts
of Congress’ spending addiction.
The Congressional Budget Office projects the annual budget
deficit will surpass $1 trillion (4.6% of gross domestic product) in fiscal
year 2020 and rise to over $1.7 trillion annually by the end of the decade. Cumulative
deficits will top $13.1 trillion from 2021 to 2030.
The Congressional Budget Office also estimates that debt
held by the public will rise to $17.9 trillion this year (80.8% of GDP) and to
total $31.4 trillion by the end of fiscal year 2030—nearly 100% of GDP.
To be clear, the increase in projected deficit and debt
levels is not a matter of the federal government taking in too little revenue. Revenues
are projected to keep rising from 16.4% of GDP in fiscal year 2020 to 18% of
GDP in 2030—higher than the 50-year average. 
However, spending is set to rise from 21% of GDP in 2021 to 23.4%
of GDP over the next 10 years. That’s 3% above the historical average. 
Here are five takeaways from the Congressional Budget Office’s budget and economic outlook:
At the end of fiscal year 2019, debt held by the public rose to 79.2% of GDP. By 2030, debt held by the public is set to reach 98.3% of GDP.
According to Office of Management
and Budget data,
the highest level of debt held by the public ever recorded in the U.S. was
106.1% of GDP in 1946—in the immediate aftermath of World War II.
It is “unprecedented” for the country to be facing such high levels of debt in a time of relative peace and economic prosperity. 
Over the next decade, the Congressional Budget Office estimates entitlement spending will rise by a combined 2.7% of GDP. Health care programs and Social Security are projected to consume 59% of all federal revenues by 2030. 
Besides net interest payments, the
Congressional Budget Office projects all other areas of federal spending to
decline as a percentage of GDP.
Both Medicare and Social Security are
unsustainable in their current forms and on a path to insolvency. Congress
should fundamentally reform these programs to lower costs and return control
over health care and retirement needs to the American people. 
Without action to slow the growth of entitlement spending, it will be nearly impossible to achieve a sustainable federal budget. 
By the end of this decade, the Congressional Budget Office estimates the federal government will spend $819 billion annually on interest payments on the national debt. That is more than double what the government spends on interest today and will amount to 10% of total projected spending in 2030.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates
that in the next 10 years, the federal government will begin to spend more
money annually on debt service payments than it will on either Medicaid or the Disability
Insurance program. Interest costs would approach the level spent on national
defense.
Interest payments on the debt are
crowding out other national priorities. If debt continues to grow, interest
payments will further strain federal resources.
The first step to reversing this trend is to ensure that lawmakers know the interest costs of legislation that comes before Congress. Under current scoring rules, interest payments are not included in cost estimates. Lawmakers should enact reforms requiring interest costs to be included in all Congressional Budget Office estimates, giving Congress a fuller picture of the impacts of its spending decisions. 
Between fiscal years 2020 and 2030, revenues are projected to rise by 2.6% of GDP. 
Some will attribute rising revenues
to the expiration of the 2017 tax cuts. But revenues will continue to grow even
if the tax cuts are made permanent because Americans get wealthier over time,
meaning more of our paychecks will be taxed at higher tax rates. 
Rising deficit and debt levels point to a spending problem. If Congress allows the tax cuts to expire, deficits will likely grow even faster than projected. Historically, tax increases are paired with increased spending, not deficit reductions. 
Projected debt of nearly 100% of GDP should serve as a sobering warning to lawmakers. But if Congress ignores that warning, the Congressional Budget Office’s long-term projections get even more dire. 
The Congressional Budget Office estimates
that without reforms aimed at lowering the debt, debt held by the public will
rise to a projected 180% of GDP in just 30 years. The report warns that
“growing debt would dampen economic output over time” and “pose significant
risks to the fiscal and economic outlook.”
This could leave lawmakers with few options
other than significantly raising taxes on all Americans, meaning less
opportunity and economic prosperity for future generations.
The Congressional Budget Office’s latest budget and economic
outlook reiterates that the current budget path is unsustainable. There is no
time to waste. Congress should act now to implement reforms that will reduce
federal spending and stabilize the national debt.
If lawmakers fail to heed these warnings, all Americans will
pay the price.

The Christmas season is here, which means the clock’s a-ticking to find the perfect gifts for your loved ones.
Here are 29 books that our friends at The Heritage Foundation think you and your family will enjoy.
1) “A Republic, If You Can Keep It” by Neil M. Gorsuch
In a collection of speeches, judicial opinions, and anecdotes,
Justice Neil Gorsuch offers advice to legal and lay audiences alike on the
importance of civility, courage, and humility in American society. Gorsuch
offers a rare glimpse into his private world, sharing poignant stories about
his final moments of anonymity before being thrust onto the national stage with
his nomination to the Supreme Court. He reveals how a neighbor helped him evade
reporters camped out near his home in the Colorado countryside and how he
enjoyed coloring pictures with a little girl on the plane ride to Washington
that would change his life forever. While fans of Gorsuch will enjoy reading
his speeches and opinions, it’s the brief piercing of the judicial veil that
leaves the reader wanting more. 
—Elizabeth Slattery is a legal fellow in The Heritage Foundation’s Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies and host of “SCOTUS 101,“ a podcast about the Supreme Court.
2) “The Unholy Trinity: Blocking the Left’s Assault on Life, Marriage, and Gender” by Matt Walsh
The fabric of American culture that was once deeply rooted
in fundamental biblical principles is rapidly unravelling at a pace that many
conservatives often don’t recognize. Matt Walsh does not mince words when it
comes to calling out the dangers of the left’s three key social battlegrounds
of redefining life, marriage, and gender. He argues that if progressivism can
reshape the meanings of gender, family, and life to its own desire, it has
established relativism over God as the supreme law and now holds the power to
destroy Western civilization. 
—Thaleigha Rampersad is a production specialist at The Heritage
Foundation.
3) “Open Borders: The Science and Ethics of Immigration” by Bryan Caplan and Zach Weinersmith
In this book, Bryan Caplan and Zach Weinersmith produce an
incredibly thoughtful book on one of the most critical policy issues of the
day. It should be read by anyone who is at all interested in immigration policy,
regardless of what one currently thinks about open borders. 
—Paul Winfree serves as
director of the Thomas A. Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies at The
Heritage Foundation.
4) “A History (and Future) of the Budget Process in the United States: Budget by Fire” by Paul Winfree
Join Paul Winfree for a fun romp through the exciting
history of America’s federal budget process. OK, maybe not a “fun romp,”
but definitely an educational and entertaining excursion. Informed by his
experience on Capitol Hill and at the White House, Paul brings a truly unique
perspective to explaining how the seemingly arcane federal budget process
actually lies at the center of nearly every major governing decision throughout
the nation’s history. In the end, Paul teaches us what we already kind of
knew: The men and women who built and governed this nation never really knew
exactly what they were doing. But by hook or by crook, driven by
principle, a little politics, and maybe a skosh of luck, they somehow succeeded
in building (and funding) a pretty amazing place. 
—Jack Spencer is vice
president of the Institute for Economic Freedom and Opportunity at The Heritage
Foundation.
5) “Political Visions and Illusions: A Survey and Christian Critique of Contemporary Ideologies” by David Koyzis
“There’s often a grain of truth in a lie.” We hear that saying in everyday life, but it’s a deeply true insight when applied to political thought, as David Koyzis shows in his winsome and accessible book. Liberalism, nationalism, socialism—each of these contain something of the truth, even if they’re ultimately wrong. How can that be? As a Christian, Koyzis points to Scripture, which teaches that God created all things good. The problem in life, and in politics, is that we’re prone to pick one good thing out of creation and ascribe ultimacy to it, putting it in the place of God. For liberals, that means giving ultimate value to the individual. For democrats, the voice of the collective people is ultimate. For socialists, material equality is ultimate. Koyzis argues that each of these political ideologies (and others) are a form of idolatry that, at root, are deeply religious—no matter how secular they may claim to be. His solution is to stop elevating one aspect of reality over others, and instead to find order in all that God has created.
Koyzis’ book offers Christians a helpful and salient way to assess political ideologies. For the non-believer, it shows how biblical truths make sense of the politically charged world we find ourselves in.
—Daniel Davis is the commentary editor of The Daily Signal and co-host of The Daily Signal Podcast.
6) “Letters to the Church” by Francis Chan
The early Church, as described throughout the book of Acts,
was called to be an unstoppable force in a broken world looking for answers,
and hope that could only be found in a life following Christ. Francis Chan
reminds readers of these fundamental principles that marked the Church at its
inception. He challenges believers to risk it all for God’s mission in the
world and passionately pursue His vision for the Church, and to transform their
Sunday attendance from what’s often become a mundane ritual to a genuine
spiritual encounter with the one true God. 
—Thaleigha Rampersad is a production specialist at The Heritage
Foundation.
7) “You are Worth It: Building a Life Worth Fighting For” by Kyle Carpenter
Kyle Carpenter’s book is an insightful reflection on living
for others. Carpenter, the youngest living Medal of Honor recipient, shares his
story from childhood through his fateful moment during a deployment in
Afghanistan when he threw himself on a grenade to protect his unit. Despite his
significant injuries, Carpenter explains how he had to choose to accept his
disabilities with humor and humility in order to use his story to support
others going through challenges. 
A particularly poignant moment that provided the name of the
book came from a conversation with his Uber driver, an immigrant who was
profoundly grateful for the opportunity to be an American. After being thanked
for his service, Carpenter without thinking replied, “You are worth it.” One of
the most inspiring takeaways from the book is that we are all given the chance
to be someone else’s miracle as we go about our daily lives, something that
Carpenter sees as his new mission after leaving the Marines. 
—Abby Bird is the
recruitment and training coordinator at The Heritage Foundation.
8) “When Breath Becomes Air” by Paul Kalanithi
This paradigm-shifting book was recommended to me by Heritage colleague Joshua Meservey. An auto-biography, “When Breath Becomes Air” drops you into the life of up-and-coming neurosurgeon Paul Kalanithi, who receives an unexpected diagnosis of terminal cancer in his early 30s. It takes you on a journey exploring the meaning of life and death as Kalanithi grapples with these concepts during his final days. The book is simultaneously about the eternal and the present, and its beautiful prose calls you to contemplate the meaning of your own life and death. Easily in my top three books I’ve ever read.
—Olivia Enos is a senior
policy analyst in the Asian Studies Center at The Heritage Foundation.
9) “The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York” by Robert A. Caro
This Pulitzer Prize-winning biography shows not just how one
man corrupted New York, but how pervasive corruption can be hidden from the
public—even in America. Caro’s legendary, meticulous research shows the reader
how power works in America and proves that our perceptions of power can be
disastrously wrong. Robert Moses, for example, built public works that were
adored by the masses on an unparalleled scale (many are still in use today),
making himself the most popular man in New York in the process. However, his
strong arm methods and explicitly racist philosophy broke New York City’s
government and infrastructure for generations to come. 
This in-depth history classic reads like a novel. He leads
the reader to hope that “maybe they can stop him this time,” only to see him
time after time subvert the checks and balances of liberty in the most creative
ways. Caro’s conversational style guides the average reader through complex
political issues at a very accessible level. A must-read for any American who
thinks they would know if their government was hijacked.
—Patrick Hulehan is a senior accountant at The Heritage Foundation.
10) “Storm of Steel” by Ernst Jünger
This book is about soldiering, plain and simple. First published in German in 1920, and later translated into English, this is a story about trench warfare in World War I as told by a plucky young German soldier. Jünger does not delve into the complex origins or political circumstances that led to the outbreak of war. If he held any political views about the Kaiser or the conduct of the war, he does not share them. If that’s what you are looking for, then this book is not for you. If you’re looking for a raw account of what it was like to fight as a young man (wounded seven times) on the losing side of one of the deadliest conflicts in human history, this is your book. 
—Luke Coffey
is the director of the Allison Center for Foreign Policy Studies at The
Heritage Foundation.
11) “Miles Gone By: A Literary Autobiography” by William F. Buckley Jr.
Buckley offers a selection of previously published writings
that limn “a narrative story of my life, at work and play.” The pieces reveal
what matters most to the founder of the modern American conservative
movement—family, friends, and his travels on land and sea. 
—Lee Edwards is the
distinguished fellow in conservative thought at The Heritage Foundation’s B.
Kenneth Simon Center for Principles and Politics.
12) “Why Soldiers Miss War: The Journey Home” by Nolan Peterson
I was first introduced to Nolan Peterson in 2015 and soon realized his tremendous talents as a writer and war journalist when we hired him as The Daily Signal’s first foreign correspondent. What I came to learn later was his rich history as a combat veteran. In his latest book, Peterson draws from his own experience as a U.S. Air Force special operations pilot in Afghanistan and Iraq to explore the lasting effects of war and the challenges of coming home.
—Rob Bluey is executive
editor of The Daily Signal.
13) “Leaving Cloud 9” by Ericka Andersen
If you enjoy memoirs, you’ll love the heartbreaking story in
“Leaving Cloud 9” of a boy who grew up amid abuse and poverty—ultimately
overcoming his past through a transformational relationship with God. After
joining the Army at 18, suffering through PTSD, divorce, and extreme
depression, Rick was at rock bottom. Meeting his wife led him through church
doors he had long abandoned. This book has been compared to “Hillbilly Elegy”
and lives up to the name. You’ll walk away recognizing that the power of God
and individual influences in our lives are far more powerful than any
government policy. A truly incredible story of redemption.
—Michelle Cordero is the digital
content manager for The Heritage Foundation.
14) “Option
B: Facing Adversity, Building Resilience, and Finding Joy” by Sheryl Sandberg and Adam Grant
“Option B” combines the story of a real-life tragedy,
experienced by tech executive Sheryl Sandberg, with insights by psychologist
Adam Grant to help people through grief and onto a path to healing and
thriving. It’s a tremendously moving and inspiring book that will be
particularly valuable for those suffering from loss and the people that
surround them. Whether you’re the person who is in pain or are trying to help a
family member, a friend, or a colleague who is experiencing grief, “Option B”
is an invaluable guide for living through pain and building resilience to find
joy again.
—Romina Boccia is the director of the Grover M. Hermann Center for the Federal Budget at The Heritage Foundation. 
15) “The Only Plane in the Sky: An Oral History of 9/11” by Garrett M. Graff
It’s often been said that there isn’t a New Yorker that
doesn’t have a Sept. 11 story. This book pieces together some of the most
poignant ones interspersed with the stories from some of the key players of the
Bush administration who were with the president on the day time stood still for
the nation. Whether you pick up an audio version (which has powerful playback
from voicemails left for loved ones from passengers on the planes before they
crashed) or purchase the hard cover copy, Graff places you directly into the
shoes of people who were affected by the events of Sept. 11, 2001. 
Once Air Traffic Control and the country’s leadership
understood the grave danger of the events that were unfolding, all planes
across the country were grounded until further notice—except one, Air Force
One. Some of the most moving testimonies are from members of the Bush
administration and the fastidious notes they took on the day of the attacks.
Recognizing that they may have had one of the most unique and interesting
points of view from that day, the stories they tell are ones so often not heard,
but so pivotal in the scheme of history. 
—Thaleigha Rampersad is a production specialist at The Heritage
Foundation.
16) “The Great Partnership” by Christian B. Keller
You don’t have to be a Civil War buff to find this book
interesting. Sure, it’s filled with historical details from several key Civil
War battles, but they’re all in the service of showing how the partnership
between Robert E. Lee and Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson developed, and why it
produced a string of military wins that stunned the pre-Gettysburg Union
Army—victories that are studied to this day. 
So while Keller’s book will probably prove most appealing to
those who love history, it’s also valuable for those trying to learn more about
leadership and how to forge an effective team—in war, yes, but also in sports
or business. Drawn from numerous primary sources, it can help just about anyone
looking for insights into what makes a partnership work, offering lessons that
can help readers in any field.
—Paul Gallagher is manager
of editorial services at The Heritage Foundation.
17) “Hymns of the Republic: The Story of the Final Year of the American Civil War” by S. C. Gwynne
In Gwynne’s third historical volume, he tackles a critically
important but seldom reviewed chapter of American History. He follows the Civil
War and its major characters from Ulysses S. Grant’s ascension as Abraham Lincoln’s
top general through the aftermath of the president’s assassination. This is a
stirring, beautifully written book that will give each reader an appreciation
for the narrative and significance of the war’s final year. Gwynne carries you
through the military, political, and personal dynamics that finally reunited
our nation. 
—Raz
Shafer is senior assistant to the president for donor relations at The
Heritage Foundation.
18) “Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup” by John Carreyrou
Elizabeth Holmes was the founder of Theranos, a Silicon Valley startup that promised to revolutionize medical treatment. Theranos said they had developed a printer-sized device that could carry out blood tests using only tiny samples. It would enable more people to identify potentially fatal diseases in their earliest stages, saving countless lives. Holmes visualized one in the home of every American. 
The concept was a sensation, and Theranos regarded as potentially the Apple of health care (a dream for Holmes, who was so obsessed with Steve Jobs she would dress like him and attempt to speak in his tone of voice). Holmes herself was a rising superstar who titans of the business and political world were scrambling to work with, including Gen. James Mattis, Henry Kissinger, and George Shultz. At its peak, Theranos was worth $9 billion.
There was, however, a catch. Theranos’ technology didn’t work. It was all a con. 
Holmes is today awaiting trial on two charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and nine counts of wire fraud. She faces up to 20 years in jail. “Bad Blood” explains how she went from being the darling of Silicon Valley to the disgrace of it. The ugly, full extent of Holmes’ megalomania, her attempts to conceal the scale of her deception, and the damage she did to all those in her orbit, are thrillingly laid out in a tale steeped with ambition, paranoia, and obsession.
—Robin Simcox is the
Margaret Thatcher Fellow at The Heritage Foundation.
19) “The British Are Coming” by Rick Atkinson
History buffs will remember Atkinson as the author of the critically acclaimed Liberation Trilogy describing the liberation of Europe in World War II, a volume that won the Pulitzer Prize. Atkinson, a former journalist, has embarked on a new enterprise, the Revolution Trilogy. The first volume, “The British Are Coming,” was published in May 2019 and covers the start of the war at Lexington to the Battle of Princeton in January 1777. Bottom line: It is a delight. Even for those well-acquainted with this period, Atkinson provides new insights and vivid color. It’s almost as if Atkinson is present, looking over the shoulder of King George as he directs the war effort, or Washington as he despairs over the state of the Continental Army. Even though it weighs in at 800 pages, you won’t want it to end. I can’t wait for volumes 2 and 3.
 —Tom Spoehr is the director of the Heritage Foundation’s Center for National Defense.
20)  “Endurance:
Shackleton’s Incredible Voyage” by Alfred Lansing
This is a riveting tale of one of the greatest survival stories in history, and how leadership, character, teamwork, and sheer gutsy determination enabled the crew of the Endurance to prevail against the overwhelming odds of Antarctica for two years. Their ship crushed by pack-ice near the outset of the expedition, the men were faced with the challenge of surviving not only the brutal winters, but the unexpected dangers of “summer” as their makeshift camps were threatened by splitting ice floes. Survival would ultimately depend on an 800-plus mile voyage by six of the crew, crossing the stormy south Atlantic in an open lifeboat only 20-feet-long to reach one of the remotest outposts of civilization on Earth.
—Dakota Wood, who served America
for two decades in the U.S. Marine Corps, is the senior research fellow for
defense programs at The Heritage Foundation.
21) “Gods of the Upper Air: How a Circle of Renegade Anthropologists Reinvented Race, Sex, and Gender in the Twentieth Century” by Charles King
A handful of renegade anthropologists reshaped how we think,
for good and ill. It’s worth reading their story to understand how we got from
there to here.
—James
Jay Carafano is The Heritage Foundation’s vice president for foreign
and defense policy studies, E. W. Richardson fellow, and director of the
Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Institute for International Studies.
22) “Covert Cows and Chick-fil-A: How Faith, Cows, and Chicken Built an Iconic Brand” by Steve Robinson
Written by the former chief marketing officer of Chick-fil-A
for over 30 years, Steve Robinson takes the reader on his journey from joining Chick-fil-A
before it was ever a household name in the fast food industry to where it is
today. Robinson also explains the impact Truett Cathy’s leadership had on his
faith, family, and career. Full disclosure: You may want to be within the
vicinity of your local Chick-fil-A while reading this as it inspired several
impromptu trips to the now widely-known and beloved fast food chain. 
—Thaleigha Rampersad is a production specialist at The Heritage
Foundation.
23) “A Partial History of Lost Causes” by Jennifer duBois
After observing the slow, painful disintegration and eventual death of her father at the hands of Huntington’s disease, the main protagonist and Russian-American academic, Irina, discovers that she will unquestionably suffer the same fate as her father. After his passing, she searches for any link to her father’s life when he was healthy and thriving and discovers a letter written by her father to famed Russian chess player-turned-politician Aleksandr Besetov. Irina and Aleksandr’s lives become inextricably linked across oceans and later in-person after Irina determines to meet him. Through beautiful and unexpected parallels to the actual game of chess, author Jennifer duBois does a masterful job tying two seemingly disparate lives together in a narrative of striving, suffering, and set-backs that, in the end, will leave you wanting more.
—Olivia Enos is a senior
policy analyst in the Asian Studies Center at The Heritage Foundation.
24) “The Murmur of Bees” by Sofia Segovia
This novel by Mexican writer Sofia Segovia, recently published in English, is really outstanding. As the blurb on Amazon notes, it’s about a mysterious child with the power to change a family’s history in a country on the verge of revolution.
—James Roberts is the
research fellow in freedom and growth at The Heritage Foundation’s Center for
International Trade and Economics.
25) “A Fire Upon the Deep” by Vernor Vinge
It’s very rare to find a book that can scratch the itch for both Tolkienian high fantasy and Star Trek-style space opera at the same time. But Vernor Vinge’s genre-defining 1992 masterpiece does just that. On the one hand, it deals with the highest of sci-fi concepts—a techno-libertarian galaxy menaced by godlike artificial intelligences, and dependent upon an endless communication network called “Known Net.” On the other hand, half the story focuses on two children who crash-landed on a medieval planet of swords and castles. The collision of these two societies results in one of the great spectacles of 20th-century sci-fi. This book is a total mind-bender that features intergalactic message-board posts, compound minds assembled from multiple dogs, and the greatest act of heroism ever committed by a potted plant. This might be a bit grim for kids, but if you want to totally sink into a world beyond your wildest imaginings, give this one a go.
—Adam Brickley serves as
program associate for lectures & seminars at The Heritage Foundation.
26) “Death Comes for the Archbishop” by Willa Cather
Best known for her stories of the Nebraska prairies, Cather makes the southwestern desert and sky characters in this beautifully written story. “Death Comes for the Archbishop” is an elegy to a mythic land and a requiem for a devout missionary who epitomizes the classic virtues of courage, justice, and wisdom.
—Lee Edwards is the
distinguished fellow in conservative thought at The Heritage Foundation’s B.
Kenneth Simon Center for Principles and Politics.
27) “Nobody Knows How to Make a Pizza” by Julie Borowski
A pizza is just some dough, sauce, cheese, and toppings. How
difficult could it be to make one? In this beautifully illustrated book, Julie
Borowski shows that there is much more to it than meets the eye. She takes
concepts from Leonard E. Read’s classic economic essay “I, Pencil” to
introduce the wonders of voluntary exchange, the division of labor, and
spontaneous order to children in a fun and engaging way. Economics explained in
a way that even children can understand. 
—Romina Boccia is the director of the Grover M. Hermann Center for the Federal Budget at The Heritage Foundation. 
28) “Mr.
Mehan’s Mildly Amusing Mythical Mammals” by Matthew Mehan
This treasured tome is a collection of 26 poems about
mythical mammals (one for each letter of the alphabet), accompanied by
paintings depicting each mammal. The poems tell a story about the Dally and the
Blug as they face life’s challenges, buoyed by the grace of their friendship.
The paintings are rich and detailed—compelling fodder for young imaginations.
The author’s desire to pass on his love of language is clear throughout, though
best punctuated in the glossary, which weaves together definitions and
references to the books prodigious literary ancestry. Mehan impressively
deploys these and other facets (did I mention the treasure hunt?) into a book
that simultaneously challenges and delights the young, old, and in-between.
—Tim
McGovern is the director of information technology at The
Heritage Foundation.
29) “The Man Who Cooked For Himself” by Phyllis Krasilovsky
“The Man Who Cooked For Himself” is a good book. His friend
who usually does his shopping for him goes on vacation, and the man eats up all
the food, so he has to go out and find food for himself. He catches fish with a
paper clip and makes pancakes out of acorns. Also, his cat is cute.

"Newsweek's retraction of a story written about conservative Dennis Prager's comments on Anne Frank has not stopped left-wing sites from misleading readers. (Photo: 
Darrin Klimek/Getty Images)

Dennis Prager
/
@DennisPrager

Dennis Prager is a columnist for The Daily Signal, nationally syndicated radio host, and creator of PragerU.
In my last column, “Newsweek Hits a New Low,” I
wrote about Newsweek’s dishonest description of what I had said on one of my
weekly PragerU “Fireside Chats.” A viewer had asked me to respond to
a statement Anne Frank made in her epic Holocaust diary. Frank said,
“Despite everything, I believe that people are really good at heart.”

The Newsweek headline, “Conservative Radio Host
Ridicules Anne Frank,” was simply a lie. In order for readers to
appreciate the level of mendacity, I had my entire response transcribed and
placed it in the column.
A few days later I received a message from Nancy Cooper,
global editor-in-chief of Newsweek. She emailed me her personal cellphone
number and asked me to call her. I did, and we had a good conversation. She
agreed that what Newsweek published mischaracterized my remarks and corrected
both the headline and the article, written by deputy editor Benjamin Fearnow.
She changed the headline to “Conservative Radio Host
Counters Anne Frank’s View That People Are ‘Good at Heart.'”
In addition, she deleted Fearnow’s sentence characterizing
me as having mocked Anne Frank. And she deleted another Fearnow falsehood: “He
also brings up Nazi comparisons frequently on his radio program, “The Dennis
Prager Show,” to criticize modern Democrats and liberals.”
I told Cooper that in 37 years of radio, I have never
compared Democrats or liberals to Nazis; Fearnow had made that up out of whole
cloth. 
In its place, she wrote the truth: “He also brings up Nazi comparisons on his radio program, ‘The Dennis Prager Show,’ saying the left ‘cheapens’ Nazi evil by using the term to dismiss political opponents or that liberals focus on Nazism while failing to acknowledge the horrors wrought by Communism.”
The following notice now appears at the end of the article:
“Update 1/8, 4:45 p.m. ET: The original headline on this story
misrepresented Prager’s comments; the headline and story have been edited to
reflect that Prager did not ‘ridicule’ or ‘mock’ Anne Frank but took issue with
her view.”
As I wrote to Cooper, “Your attention to this says a
lot about you and your hopes for Newsweek. Thank you.”
But the story doesn’t end there.
First, has Newsweek disciplined Fearnow in any way? (I never
heard from Fearnow.)
Second, and more important, the original lie about me has
taken on a life of its own. It was conveyed on numerous left-wing sites.
Wonkette, under the sarcastic headline “Dennis Prager Will Not Be Bullied by Anne Frank,” wrote a deceit-filled article about my comments about Anne Frank. At this writing, the column is followed by 654 reader comments—virtually every one of them repeating the lie started by Newsweek and continued by Wonkette.
There has not been a word on Wonkette about Newsweek’s
correction.
The Daily Dot—”conceived as the Internet’s ‘hometown newspaper,’ focuses on topics such as streaming entertainment, geek culture, memes, gadgets, and social issues, such as LGBT, gender, and race,” as Wikipedia describes—reprinted the original Newsweek charge. 
There has not been a word on The Daily Dot about Newsweek’s
correction.
Under the headline “Dennis Prager on Anne Frank: ‘I
Don’t Get My Wisdom from Teenagers,'” the Patheos website’s Friendly
Atheist page wrote, “Leave it to right-wing commentator Dennis Prager,
founder of a fake online ‘university’ … to dismiss Frank’s comment …
because she was a child and therefore too dumb to understand anything.”
There has not been a word on Patheos about Newsweek’s
correction.
Inquisitr, which claims 40 million readers a month,
headlined its disparaging article “Conservative Pundit Dennis Prager
Ridicules Anne Frank.”
There has not been a word on Inquistr about Newsweek’s
correction.
Democratic Undergound’s headline read, “Conservative
Radio Host Dennis Prager Ridicules Anne Frank.” It features a tweet from
@Kokomothegreat that has 499 retweets.
There has not been a word on Democratic Underground or from
Koko about Newsweek’s correction.
I note all of this to make three points.
First, as I have said for decades: While truth is a
conservative value and a liberal value, it has never been a left-wing value.
Second, the left’s primary response to those with whom it
differs is to smear.
Third, smears cannot be undone.
This was brilliantly brought home to me in a famous Jewish
story I first heard when I was a student in yeshiva.
The tale is told of a Jew in Eastern Europe who had
slandered his rabbi but soon regretted it. So, he went to his rabbi, told him
what he had done, sincerely apologized, and asked the rabbi’s forgiveness.
“Bring me two feather pillows,” the rabbi
responded.
The man did. 
“Am I now forgiven?” he asked.
“Now cut open the pillows,” the rabbi responded.
The man had no idea why the rabbi made these requests, but
deeply wanting the rabbi’s forgiveness, he did as he was told. 
“Am I now forgiven?” the man asked.
“Now let the feathers fly away,” the rabbi responded.
Once again, the man did as the rabbi requested.
“Am I now forgiven?” the exasperated man asked.
“Just do one more thing,” the rabbi responded.
“Bring back the feathers.”
Benjamin Fearnow and the left-wing websites cannot bring back the feathers. Nor, apparently, do they want to.

Every year, colleges raise tuition prices yet again. That’s helped create the student debt crisis, and it’s causing more young people to skip college altogether. But what’s the government’s role here? Is it making things worse? And if so, what’s the solution? Richard Vedder, author of  “Restoring the Promise: Higher Education in America” shares his thoughts. Read the interview, posted below, or listen on the podcast:

Daniel Davis: I’m joined now by Richard Vedder. He is senior fellow at the Independent Institute and author of the book “Restoring the Promise: Higher Education in America.” 
Mr. Vedder, thank you for joining us.
Richard Vedder: Delighted to be with you, Daniel.
Davis: So, lots of younger folks, in my generation and younger, are saddled with student debt and I want to ask you about that. 
We often think of student federal aid as a good thing, something that helps us afford college, but you write in your book that government aid actually contributes to the problem. Can you explain that for us?
Vedder: Sure. When they started the student loan programs around 1970, and they grew very large in the late ’70s, an extension of the Student Loan Act provided this money. 
When this happened, colleges said, “Aha! Kids are going to be able to afford college more than before, so we can be more aggressive in raising our fees.” 
So colleges, starting in the late ’70s, started to raise their fees. They used to go up a little bit more than the inflation rate, maybe 1% more a year than the inflation rate. Now they started going up far faster, 3% or more faster than the inflation rate. 
And if you compound that over 40 years, which is the amount of time that has passed since then, … kids are now paying about double the tuition fees they would’ve paid if that had not happened.
So the tuition fees in America have been pushed up by the student loan programs. I think Bill Bennett, who was secretary of education, wrote a op-ed in The New York Times, of all places, in 1987 where he made that point. 
And a lot of people poo-pooed it and said, “Ah, that’s not true.” But the research from the New York Fed and the National Bureau of Economic Research has validated what Bill Bennett said.
Davis: Wow. So would you say government intervention really is the key driver, the main driver of tuition these days? We see tuition every year going up.
Vedder: It has been. Now, in fairness, in a lot of recent developments, tuition fees are starting to rise less rapidly and schools are desperate because enrollments have been falling. 
Fees went up so much that college became prohibitively expensive for some people, particularly low-income people [who] saw these massive sticker prices and they just didn’t apply in some cases to college. 
So the irony of it is we put in student loans to help mostly low-income people, supposedly, and the reality is the low-income people have been scared away from college more than the affluent, middle-income or upper-income people. 
I call this the law of unintended consequences. Things turned out to be just the opposite of what the government intended.
Davis: Do you think there’s any hope of reversing that with federal policy?
Vedder: It’s going to be tough because our vested interests are always going to fight change. If we did things right, we would start reversing that and we can whittle away at it. 
We can limit student loans, the number of years you could borrow, we could limit it to only undergraduate education and not expensive graduate education. We can cut out something called Plus loans, which are loans often made to parents of students. 
We could also make the loans more on a commercial basis, that is you don’t get the money unless there’s some reasonable prospect that you’re going to graduate. You got to have a minimal academic status. 
There are a lot of things we could do to improve the system, but we need to start doing those things.
Davis: I want to ask you also about the issue of free speech on campus, which is increasingly an issue that even the president has addressed. 
Back in the ’60s, the sort of young, new left on campus were championing free speech. And speculate as to why, I mean, it certainly helped their voice. But now that they have a monopoly on the university, it seems that they’re more in favor of shutting it down. 
Just historically, I’m curious about when this started. When did free speech really start getting shut down on campuses? Is this a recent phenomenon?
Vedder: You could argue that free speech has been closed down on campuses since the 15th, 16th century. Galileo wasn’t allowed to say what he wanted to say and faced the consequences. But when the Enlightenment came in the 18th century, the idea is that free speech is liberating. It improves the mind, it improves the economy, and so forth. 
And we had the classical liberal revolution that is what made us what we are today as a nation and planet, really, a wealthy and prosperous place. All that started way back then and then we were getting rid of barriers to free speech, the ideas enhancing free speech.
 … We had, in the 1950s, some restriction on free speech, but in what was called the McCarthy era, where Sen. [Joseph] McCarthy, who was … most people would say was a conservative Republican, but I don’t look at that in quite that way, he was fiercely anti-Communist. And we had loyalty oaths that some professors had to sign in order to have jobs as teaching and so on. 
So we’ve had episodes in American history where government has interfered with the process of education to impose certain restrictions.
That’s coming back again, it’s not so much the government, it’s … well, in some sense, the government is enforcing it, I think, because diversity of ideas is not part of the agenda of the welfare state. And indeed, the agenda the welfare state seems almost to be the opposite. 
We all have to think alike because there is a progressive way of thinking and that problem has grown, I think gradually, since the ’80s and the ’90s, but it is certainly reached a crescendo level in the last decade or so.
But again, if the federal government weren’t in the higher ed business at all, which essentially they weren’t before 1960 or ’65, I don’t think we would be having these problems. Or at least we wouldn’t have them at the level of severity that we do. Because colleges were competing for students without subsidies from the government. 
There are consequences when you turn people off and a lot of these protests have turned people off.
Look at Evergreen State in the state of Washington where they went wild with protests and, at one time, were even telling certain students, white students, that they couldn’t go to campus. And what’s happened there, dramatic decline in enrollments and so forth.
I think the American people, by and large, have a different set of values with respect to these things than is prevailing in the collegiate communities. 
Schools like Yale get away with murder in this regard because for one thing, they have huge endowments so no matter what they do, they’re insulated from the market. And we need to let market forces work more and the biggest single thing that would help that is for the government to get out of the higher education business.
Davis: Yeah. I saw a few years ago … the Mizzou controversy with the professor getting fired because she was involved in the physical confrontation. I mean, they saw a drop-off of students.
Vedder: Dramatic at Missouri. Several thousand, they’ve had to let go a number of faculty members and what not. 
The irony of it is, a secondary effect is appropriations on the part of the state government from the university have fallen significantly because the legislators are fed up with this. And rightfully so, I might add, in this case.
So protesting is costly to universities, but they feel they have to allow [it] because they’re being intimidated by a small group of students. Sometimes not so small, sometimes medium-sized group of students on some of these campuses. 
It’s time that we stand up to this and one way to do it is to threaten the removal of federal funds. President Trump intimated as much in his recent executive order.
Davis: Last question I just want to ask you. … Some members of Congress [are] talking about how … they’ve kind of been turned off by the way that universities have gone and are saying that college isn’t for everyone, it’s not as good as it’s cooked up to be, we need to consider trade schools, look at those. 
I think a lot of conservatives are interested in that because it would break up the monopoly that, among other things, is indoctrinating a new generation of people. 
So with that, with the college costs, and everything that goes into a four-year university, do you think it’s still worth it for young people to attend the four-year college?
Vedder: There are some people that benefit from a four-year college and will continue. There are things that colleges do that some people will benefit from. 
Part of it is vocational, they’ll develop credentials that make them look good to law schools and look good to employers and so forth. And so there are some students, some people for whom this is true. 
But there’s a large group of students for whom this is not true or who drop out or fail. Forty percent of the kids drop-out, another 40% graduate and they end up doing jobs like being a barista or working in a Walmart or a Home Depot or something like that. So the risk of going is rising. The risk of going to college.
So is it less risky to be trained to be a welder or a plumber? Yes. Even there you can fail, but if you fail, the consequences are not as great. You don’t have four years of schooling, you have less money involved.
Davis: You make a lot more money welding.
Vedder: And you make more money welding. 
So I generally wish [for] government [to] get out of the education business. But if you’re going to be in the education business, I think it would be smart to turn some of our resources away from the traditional universities toward these kind of programs. 
Vocational education, which, by the way, 50, 75 years ago, we did have a more vibrant vocational education program in America and we got away from that because we told everyone, “College is for all. You have to go to college.” That was very bad advice and we’re reaping the consequences of it now.
Davis: Well, the book is called “Restoring the Promise: Higher Education in America.” Richard Vedder, really appreciate your time.
Vedder: Thanks.

@UrbanCURE

Star Parker is a columnist for The Daily Signal and president of the Center for Urban Renewal and Education.
It has been said that the very moment a man finds himself, he finds God.
That captures the story of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, a man of deep faith whose youthful struggles with racism caused that faith to be shaken, but who later returned to it more deeply and more resolutely because of his great character and refusal to settle for anything but truth.
The new documentary film “Created Equal: Clarence Thomas in His Own Words” will be released in theaters nationwide Friday, exquisitely timed with February being Black History Month. 
But this is also a time of great tensions and divisions
in our nation, with race continuing to be one of the main issues dividing us.
In 2007, Thomas published his memoir “My Grandfather’s Son,” which tells the story of his journey from beginning life dirt-poor in Pin Point, Georgia, to his confirmation as U.S. Supreme Court associate justice in 1991.  
Now, filmmaker Michael Pack delivers Thomas’ remarkable story to us in his own words, bringing to the screen exclusive interviews with Thomas and his wife, Virginia Thomas, in which they speak their minds.
Thomas strikes a strong personal note with me because I know well what he means when he talks about being attacked for being black by not acting and saying what is expected from a black person.
I was in the early days of my own work in policy activism when Democrats brought Anita Hill into Thomas’ confirmation hearing. I helped organize a large group of black pastors to come to Washington from around the country and demonstrate support for him.
When Branch Rickey, president and general manager of the then-Brooklyn Dodgers, recruited Jackie Robinson to be the first black player in Major League Baseball, Rickey warned Robinson that he would be challenged to focus on the game and not react to the racist jeers that would come—not just from the stands, but from his own white teammates.
“They’ll taunt you and goad you,” Rickey warned. “They’ll do anything to make you react. They’ll try to provoke a race riot in the ballpark.”
Clarence Thomas had to stand the same test.
Except this time, it was not whites trying to drive a black man off the field. It was liberals—black liberals and white liberals—trying to drive a black conservative off the field.
Thomas describes what he had to endure: “[Y]ou’re not really black, because you’re not doing what we expect black people to do.”
And with regard to what the left was trying to achieve with Hill, he said: “People should just tell the truth: ‘This is the wrong black guy. He has to be destroyed.’”
That circles back to Thomas’ similarities with Robinson. Both men drew their strength from their deep faith to stand with integrity in the face of merciless attacks.
Thomas talks about the restoration of his Catholicism after his youthful rebellion and black radicalism: “I asked God, ‘If you take anger out of my heart, I’ll never hate again.’”
Anger and hate are just other forms of slavery. Other people are controlling you.
Thomas became a free man once his faith was restored.
Thomas is now the most senior justice on the Supreme Court and has become one of America’s great conservative elder statesmen. His opinions over the years already have created a legacy of finely and rigorously reasoned jurisprudence, faithful to the core principles on which America was founded.
When Thomas was sworn in—after enduring what no man or woman should have to endure in his confirmation hearings—he alluded in his speech to Psalm 30, which reads: “I will praise you, Lord, for you have rescued me. You refused to let my enemies triumph over me. … Weeping may go on all night, but joy comes with the morning.”
What better way to pay tribute to America and black history than going to see this important new film?

Rachel del Guidice: We are joined today on The Daily Signal Podcast by Tom Jipping. He’s the deputy director of the Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies and senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation. He is also the author of a new Heritage Foundation report, “The 1972 Equal Rights Amendment Can No Longer Be Ratified—Because It No Longer Exists.” Tom, thank you so much for being with us today.
Jipping: Thanks for having me.
del Guidice: So on Monday, Virginia passed the Equal Rights Amendment, or the ERA. Before we get started, can you just kind of briefly go over what the ERA is?
Jipping: Sure. The Equal Rights Amendment is a proposed amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The effort to make it part of the Constitution has been going on since the 1920s, and proposals to send it to the states have been introduced in Congress more than a thousand times over those years. 
It got the two-thirds vote of both houses of Congress that the Constitution requires only once and that was in 1972, and that sent the ERA to the states. The Constitution requires that three-quarters of the states must ratify an amendment before it becomes part of the Constitution. 
In terms of what the ERA says, the version that was sent to the states in 1972 is very short. It simply says that that rights shall not be denied based on sex. And it was increasingly controversial when it was proposed in the 1970s, a lot of states ratified it quite quickly, and then that progress slowed dramatically as different organizations really urged state legislatures to examine not just the words of it, which sound pretty simple, but what it could be used to do.
As a result, a total of 35 states ratified it by the deadline. It did have a seven-year deadline when it was proposed, so that deadline would have been in March of 1979. And then Congress extended it once to June 30, 1982. And when that deadline passed and there weren’t three-quarters of the states on board, the ERA effectively died. 
The reason we’re talking about it today is that after about kind of 20-25 years of just sort of sitting there, some ERA activists and some feminist organizations started thinking a little more creatively, if they could get the progress going, could they pick up where they left off back in 1982? 
And some made the argument that states could still ratify the 1972 ERA and if they had three more states, that would get them to 38, that was three-quarters, and bingo, it would happen.
So, Nevada ratified in 2017, Illinois ratified in 2018, and now Virginia claims to be the 38th state to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment. 
In my paper, I explain what really is a pretty commonsense idea. The deadline was a deadline, June 30, 1982. After that date, the ERA no longer existed. It wasn’t pending before the states anymore. So, whatever it is that Virginia says that it did, you can’t ratify a constitutional amendment that doesn’t exist. 
If activists want the ERA be part of the Constitution, they’re going to have to start over again. They’re going to have to get Congress to propose it again and get it to the states for ratification. But the 1972 ERA is dead.
del Guidice: So proponents of the ERA, a local Richmond news station had said that these people are saying that the amendment will enshrine equality for women in the Constitution. Would you say, knowing what the ERA is, is that the case?
Jipping: As I said, the debate about what the ERA would or wouldn’t do, either intended or unintended consequences, has been going on since literally the 1920s. 
In the very beginning, believe it or not, feminist groups and labor unions strongly opposed the ERA because they said it could be used to prevent legislation that would actually benefit women. Today, those roles are reversed, but there’s a lot of discussion and has been since it was proposed in 1972 about how much mischief it could actually be used for.
 … This goes to your question as well, the other debate is whether existing law, either provisions of the Constitution, state constitutions, many states have passed their own ERAs, whether those laws that are in place today, that certainly weren’t in place in the 1970s, provide the legal protection that women need. 
There’s certainly debates about those questions. I do think that the threat or the possibility that something even as simple as the ERA could be used, especially in the courts, for all kinds of other things. I think that danger is much more real today even than it was in 1972.
We see all the time groups going to the courts with a Constitution that says one thing and they persuade judges that it says something else. And we end up changing the country in profound ways that were never intended. And I think whether it’s abortion, the LGBT agenda, all sorts of things that would very definitely be on the litigation agenda, should the ERA become part of the Constitution.
del Guidice: You touched on this a bit earlier, but to drill down into it a little bit more, Virginia is claiming, as you mentioned, to be the 38th state to pass the ERA. So does that mean that it’s now a constitutional amendment? You hinted on this, but just to clarify for everyone listening.
Jipping: The process, and this is laid out by a federal statute, once a state does what Virginia did, it sends what the statute calls ratifying documents to the Office of the Federal Register—that’s an agency here in Washington that publishes the federal register, which is a record of regulations. 
Once the Office of Federal Register has received those documents from 38 states, they notify the archivist of the United States and then the archivist does a review of those documents for what the statute calls legal sufficiency. Basically just to make sure that they’re legally sound. 
And then if there are 38 states’ ratifications that are legally sound, it becomes part of the Constitution. Congress has no role, they don’t have to take any vote. The president isn’t involved.
So the question is, if the ERA expired in 1982, if it literally was not available for ratification, when these documents get here to Washington and the archivist does his review, what’s he going to say? Can he say that ratification of a amendment that doesn’t exist is legally sound? I don’t think so. But that’s the process that is spelled out in federal statute. 
And I suppose almost everything ends up in court at some point in this country. So, I suppose at some point thereafter there might be a lawsuit. But that’s what has to happen next.
del Guidice: Five states tried to take back their support of the ERA. Can a state do that?
Jipping: Well, that’s an important part of the ERA story. As I said, the effort to get states to ratify the ERA really took off in 1972, and a couple of dozen states very quickly ratified it. Not only did the pace of new states dwindle, but because of the rapidly increasing opposition, as you said, five of the states that did ratify, they rescinded that ratification.I believe those rescissions are valid. 
In other words, until 38 states ratify the amendment, it’s not an amendment. It’s not part of the Constitution. It’s still pending. And a state can make its decision, they can change their mind, they can do one thing one year and five years later, undo it if they want. Until that ratification deadline happens, the amendment is pending and as long as it’s pending, states can do what they want to do.
In my opinion, by the deadline, by the 1982 deadline, only 30 states had validly ratified the ERA and they would’ve needed eight more. But my dad said close count only counts in tiddlywinks or horseshoes or something and 35 is just as far away from 38 as 30 is. Either way, the ERA is dead.
del Guidice: In 2019, there was a House committee that passed a bill that would have removed the 1982 deadline for the ERA. So could the Senate and House, hypothetically speaking, retroactively remove that 1982 deadline and let the Equal Rights Amendment move forth?
Jipping: No. As I said, June 30, 1982, the ERA is dead. Congress cannot amend a bill that has failed. That would be like introducing an amendment today to a bill that was introduced three years ago or something like that. It doesn’t exist. A deadline is a deadline. 
The Constitution gives Congress a significant authority to propose constitutional amendments and the Supreme Court has held clearly that that includes the authority to set a deadline. Congress did that. The deadline is passed. Everyone knows what a deadline is. The deadline has passed. As frustrating as that might be to some political activists, as much as people might wish that hadn’t happened, it did.
The Congressional Research Service, which, as I’m sure you know, is a well-respected, widely used resource of nonpartisan research—when I worked in the United States Senate, we relied on them frequently—they’ve published a huge work about the Constitution and its interpretation. I mean, it’s literally almost 3,000 pages long, covering every subject imaginable. 
And for more than 20 years, the Congressional Research Service has said that on June 30, 1982, the ERA died. We can make, and lawyers can make, any subject really complicated no matter how simple it is, but that’s the deadline. It passed. The ERA is dead.
del Guidice: So you have people celebrating it even still, even though we have this deadline that has passed, and if these advocates still wanted to go about and actually do this the right way, how would they go about doing that? Would they reintroduce it? What are the steps to that?
Jipping: The process is the same as they did for the 1972 ERA. A member of Congress would introduce a joint resolution that includes a deadline, if there is one. It designates whether states must ratify the amendment by legislature or convention. And then it includes the language of the amendment. 
If two-thirds of Congress pass that, it gets sent to the states, three-fourths of the states ratify it, it becomes part of the Constitution. So that process has to start over. 
As I said, since the ’20s, those resolutions to propose the ERA have been introduced over a thousand times. Everybody knows that that’s the process and that if it doesn’t work the first time, you do it again, you start over.
As I say, I realize that’s frustrating. With the opposition to the original ERA there’d probably be more opposition now, and so the likelihood that it would become part of the Constitution is probably lower. 
I can see where they would want to grasp whatever strategy they thought could give them a leg up on that, but this isn’t it. The deadline passed 37 years ago.
del Guidice: Earlier this week, Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring said per American University Radio, “I am committed as ever to making sure we have and use every single tool at our disposal to make sure the Equal Rights Amendment becomes part of the United States Constitution.” So in his role as Virginia attorney general, is there anything he can do to achieve that?
Jipping: You’ll notice that he didn’t say anything specific about whether the 1972 ERA has in fact been ratified by Virginia. Interestingly, in 1994, the deputy attorney general of Virginia issued an opinion saying specifically, he was responding to a member of the legislature that the ERA was no longer pending and could not be ratified. That was 25 years ago. 
So Attorney General Herring I’m not aware has reversed that. What he’s saying is he wants to see the ERA become part of the Constitution. Lots of people do, and there’s a process for that.
del Guidice: Alabama, South Dakota, and Louisiana, they’re suing the head archivist of United States saying that it would be illegal to add the ERA as an amendment. What’s your perspective on that suit and where do you think it will go?
Jipping: As I mentioned about the process, the archivist is sort of the final step of the process. He has to make that review to make sure that the documents he’s received from at least 38 states are legally sound. He hasn’t done that yet, he hasn’t made any decision on that yet. So the lawsuit is probably a little premature, but they’re focusing it in the right place. 
In other words, they’re following federal statute as to what the process actually is. It doesn’t become part of the Constitution unless the archivist issues a proclamation to that effect. So he’s where the buck stops, and that’s the final decision that has to be made. But they’re right to do it, and it really doesn’t matter whether your state has or hasn’t ratified.
I wish that more people, including in this case, feminist groups and so on, … would be more united on the process that has to be followed for our government to function under the Constitution. 
We all ought to agree on that, that the Constitution’s rules apply to everyone. No one gets to skirt around a different way, or come up with a way of avoiding what the Constitution requires. Doesn’t matter what your politics are. 
We all ought to respect that and insist that the Constitution’s rules be followed. If we do in this case, the ERA has to start over.
del Guidice: Going off of that point, Tom, really quickly, why don’t you think there were Virginia lawmakers—maybe there were a few, I didn’t see any and I could have missed it—that said, “Hey, this deadline has been missed. We have no business doing this”?
Jipping: Unfortunately, I think we have more politicians than statesman in a lot of our legislatures. I saw quotes from members of the Virginia Legislature, including Republicans, who said, “Well, just let the courts sort that out. This is an important time to take a stand so let’s just let the courts figure that out.” 
That’s a complete abdication of their responsibility and it violates their oath of office. They took an oath to support and defend the Constitution and that includes the Constitution’s rules for amending it. And so to simply kind of duck out of that and weasel out of that responsibility and just say, “Ah, the courts will sort it out,”—good grief.
The courts have done enough damage to our country in taking authority away from our elected representatives and away from the people for making these kinds of decisions. That was more than disappointing to hear that. 
We ought to have our representatives follow their oath of office, insist on those basic rules, and then we can handle and address our political differences. 
But if the system itself is going to crumble because our elected representatives don’t care about it, then we’re in bigger trouble than I thought.
del Guidice: Tom, you mentioned this a little bit earlier, but saying that everything usually ends up in court at some point in time. So, … depending on what happens with different states ratifying, do you foresee a legal battle at some point with the ERA?
Jipping: Well, I do. If, for example, the archivist were to say, as I think he should, that the last three states to supposedly ratify—that would be Nevada, Illinois in Virginia—their ratifications are not legally sound, and shouldn’t be recognized, then I suppose there might be states in left-wing groups that would go to court to try to force him to do that. 
 … There’s a lot at stake with something that is this symbolic, something that has been around this long. It stands for an awful lot, both positively and negatively. So a lot of political interest would see, one way or another, that their interests are tied up in the ERA, and that usually means that someone will go to court.
del Guidice: You can find Tom’s report, “The 1972 Equal Rights Amendment Can No Longer Be Ratified“—Because It No Longer Exists on heritage.org if you want to learn more about it. Tom, thank you so much for being with us on The Daily Signal Podcast.
Jipping: Thanks for having me.

Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, is president of the American Action Forum.
A majority of House Democrats are co-sponsoring legislation (HR 1384) to outlaw virtually all Americans’ public and private health insurance and replace their coverage with a new government plan. In the Senate, Sen. Bernie Sanders’ “Medicare for All” bill (S 1129) would accomplish the same objective.
Americans must fully grasp the necessary trade-offs—the sacrifices—they would have to make if Congress were to create and run such a massive program.
Medicare for All poses a very big question: Is the promise of universal health  insurance under a new government health program worth the deliberate  destruction of all other public, private, and employer-based coverage?
In today’s churning insurance markets, about 30 million American  residents are uninsured. Examining the data, American Enterprise  Institute analysts note that about 15 million Americans already are eligible for coverage under Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, and the Affordable Care Act of 2010 (also known as ACA or Obamacare).  
Mysteriously, they do not enroll.
Almost 4 million are eligible for  employer-sponsored insurance, but do not enroll. Several million (at least 4 million) are here illegally and thus ineligible for taxpayer-financed coverage. An additional 2 million have annual incomes that exceed 400% of the federal poverty level ($103,000 for a family of four) and are ineligible for Obamacare insurance subsidies.
Finally,  about 2.5 million of the uninsured are poor Americans who live in states that didn’t expand Medicaid. This is a problem that can be solved through targeted measures—without destroying all  existing health coverage.
Then there’s the cost. In the initial 10 years of implementing a Medicare for All program, the aggregate price tag could range between $54.6  trillion and $60.7 trillion, according to Charles Blahous, a former  Medicare trustee. 
Comprehensive econometric analyses, ranging from the Urban Institute to the Rand Corp., also show that such a program would substantially increase total costs over current law.
Most Americans would also pay more for their health care than they do  today. According to a recent Heritage Foundation analysis, financing  such a program would require broad-based taxation equal to 21.2% of all wage and salary income, and reduce the disposable income of  nearly two-thirds (65.5%) of American households, making them financially worse off than they are today.
Another big trade-off would be a decline in the timely access to quality care. For example, Sanders’ Medicare for All plan would cut medical-provider rates by an estimated 40% below projected private reimbursement. Such a sharp reduction  would inevitably mean increased waiting times, longer delays, and denials  of care.
Medicare today sets prices for more than 8,000 physicians’ services and hundreds of hospital procedures in more than 3,000 U.S. counties. Government  price-fixing often results in medical goods or services being reimbursed  at levels that are often too high or too low. In short, either  beneficiaries or taxpayers are routinely shortchanged.
Congressional champions of Medicare for All legislation often insist that a new universal Medicare-like entitlement, compared with multi-payer private insurance, would centralize all provider payment and secure significant administrative  cost savings.
Comparisons between Medicare and private insurance are often apples-to-oranges comparisons. For example, private firms tend to concentrate more heavily (and  successfully) on such items as utilization review, quality measurement, and fraud detection. 
Medicare does not concentrate as effectively in these areas, and though it  records lower administrative costs, it also loses tens of billions of  dollars annually (roughly 10%) in waste, fraud, abuse, or  “improper” payments.
These are real costs, but they are rarely counted as part of Medicare’s  administrative costs. The Government Accountability Office has recorded more than $50 billion annually in waste, fraud, or abuse. If  today’s Medicare is the model, taxpayers can expect those large annual losses to increase to scale with a universal program.
Public policy is not simply a matter of setting goals. It is also a process of making trade-offs, and Medicare for All has some very serious ones: 
—Destruction of existing health insurance coverage, regardless of personal preferences.
—Abolition of alternatives to government care.
—Higher personal and public health care  costs.
—Longer wait times and delays and denials of care.
—A more thorough politicization of health care decision-making, courtesy of Congress and whatever presidential administration controls the levers of bureaucratic power.
Congress can—and should—take a different approach. 
Lawmakers should enact policies that will give individuals and families much greater control over their  health care dollars and decisions, and compel health insurers and medical professionals to compete and deliver high-quality care at competitive prices.

"It seems that Americans may have been happier, and certainly less lonely, during the Great Depression and World War II than today. (Photo:

@DennisPrager

Dennis Prager is a columnist for The Daily Signal, nationally syndicated radio host, and creator of PragerU.
I began part one of “Why Are So Many Young People Unhappy?” with data showing the apparently unprecedentedly high rate of unhappiness among young people in America (and elsewhere, but I am focusing on America). 
The rates of suicide, self-injury, depression, mass shootings, and loneliness (at all ages) are higher than ever recorded. 
It seems that Americans may have been happier, and certainly less lonely, during the Great Depression and World War II than today, even with today’s unprecedentedly high levels of health, longevity, education, and material well-being.
There is, of course, no single explanation, and I listed a number of possible explanations: 
Increased use of illicit drugs and prescription drug abuse, and less human interaction because of constant cellphone use are two widely offered, valid explanations. Less valid explanations include competition, grades anxiety, capitalism, and income inequality. And then there are young people’s fears that because of global warming, they have a bleak, and perhaps no, future.
But I do believe that a loss of values and meaning are the two greatest sources of unhappiness. 
Among the values lost are those of communal associations. As the great foreign observer of early American life Frenchman Alexis de Tocqueville wrote in 1831, Americans’ unique strength derived largely from their participation in innumerable nongovernmental associations—professional, social, civil, political, artistic, philanthropic, and, of course, religious.
But these have all dwindled as government has become ever larger. Whereas Americans got together and formed bonds of friendship through nongovernmental associations, through what organizations will Americans form friendships today? 
In a video presentation at its 2012 national convention, the Democratic Party offered its answer: “Government’s the only thing that we all belong to,” the narrator said.
Then there are traditional middle-class values, like getting married first and then having children. 
Today, a greater percentage of Americans are born to unwed mothers than ever before, and fewer people are marrying than ever before. There are, for the first time in our history, more single Americans than married Americans. 
While it is certainly possible to feel lonely in a marriage, people are far more likely to feel lonely without a spouse, and increasingly without children, than with a spouse and children.
And now we come to the biggest problem of all: the lack of meaning.
Aside from food, the greatest human need is meaning. I owe this insight to Viktor Frankl and his classic work “Man’s Search for Meaning,” which I first read in high school and which influenced me more than any book other than the Bible. 
Karl Marx saw man as primarily motivated by economics; Sigmund Freud saw man as primarily driven by the sexual drive; Charles Darwin, or at least his followers, sees us as primarily driven by biology.   
But Frankl was right. 
As regards economics, poor people who have meaning can be happy, but wealthy people who lack meaning cannot be.
As regards sex, people who do not have a sexual life (such as priests, who keep their vow of chastity; many widowed and divorced older people; and others) but have meaning can be happy. Sexually active people who do not have meaning cannot be.
As regards biology, there is no evolutionary explanation for the need for meaning. Every creature except the human being does fine without meaning.
And nothing has given Americans—or any other people, for that matter—as much meaning as religion. But since World War II, God and religion have been relegated to the dustbin of history. 
The result?  
More than a third of Americans born after 1980 affiliate with no religion. This is unprecedented in American history; until this generation, the vast majority of Americans have been religious.
Maybe, just maybe, the death of religion—the greatest provider of meaning, while certainly not the only—is the single biggest factor in the increasing sadness and loneliness among Americans (and so many others). 
A 2016 study published in the American Medical Association JAMA Psychiatry journal found that American women who attended a religious service at least once a week were five times less likely to commit suicide. Common sense suggests the same is true of men. 
The bottom line: The reason so many young people are depressed, unhappy, and angry is the left has told them that God and Judeo-Christian religions are nonsense; their country is largely evil; their past is deplorable; and their future is hopeless.
That seems to be a major reason, if not the reason, for so much unhappiness: not capitalism, not inequality, not patriarchy, sexism, racism, homophobia, or xenophobia but rather having no religion, no God, no spouse, no community, no country to believe in, and, ultimately, no meaning. That explains much of the unprecedented unhappiness. 
And it explains the widespread adoption of that secular substitute for traditional religion: leftism. But unlike Judaism and Christianity, leftism does not bring its adherents happiness.

"Anti-abortion activists participate in the March for Life, an annual event to mark the anniversary of the 1973 Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion in the U.S., outside the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., Jan. 18, 2019. (Photo: Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images)
“Life Empowers: Pro-life Is Pro-Woman” is the theme of this year’s March for Life, set to take place Friday in the nation’s capital. Since 1974, the March for Life has gathered to remember the lives lost since the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade ruling legalizing abortion, and to remind America that each life has value. 
Jeanne Mancini, president of the March for Life, joins The Daily Signal Podcast to discuss what to expect at this year’s march and where the pro-life movement as a whole is headed in 2020. Listen to the podcast or read the lightly edited transcript below.  
Virginia Allen: I am joined by the president of March for Life, Jeanne Mancini. Jeanne, thank you so much for being with me today.
Jeanne Mancini: Thanks so much for having me, Virginia.
Allen: Now, March for Life began in January of 1974, one year after the passage of Roe v. Wade. March for Life really started out just as a small, peaceful demonstration, but it quickly grew into the world’s largest pro-life event. The 2020 march is taking place on Jan. 24 in Washington, D.C. Can you share with us what the theme is that you all chose for this year’s march?
Mancini: I’d love to and if it’s OK, I’ll just give a little bit of backdrop that every year we do a lot of thinking and discerning about the appropriate theme because with the March for Life being the only place where all of the different pro-life groups come together annually, it’s an awesome springboard to message, essentially, about what we think are the most cutting edge, most pressing issues in building a culture of life. 
Themes in past years have included adoption and nubile decision. Another year, in fact, last year, we had pro-life as pro-science and really delved into the science behind embryology and some of the wonderful neonatal surgeries available, etc.
This year our theme is “Life Empowers: Pro-Life Is Pro-Woman.” And, of course, this is the year where we celebrate the centennial anniversary of the 19th Amendment, which created a woman’s right to vote. 
So it’s a great opportunity to go back and look at the suffragist, the early feminist, the early female leaders who recognize the inherent dignity of women and the inherent dignity of the unborn. We’re not at odds with each other and they had a really good understanding about that.
We’re having a lot of fun with this theme and we’re excited to be able to talk about that more next week.
Allen: Absolutely. Now, who is
speaking at this year’s march?
Mancini: We’ve got a great, great, great lineup and stay tuned because there are more announcements to be made even tomorrow. 
Legislatively, we will welcome to the stage Representative Chris Smith, as well as state Representative, state Senator, as of yesterday, Katrina Jackson. 
Chris Smith is very well-known. He’s from New Jersey and just a stalwart on our issues. 
Katrina Jackson as well is very interesting because she’s one of the few pro-life Democrats and, in particular, we’re so interested to have her this year because she was the author of the bill in Louisiana related to abortion clinic regulations that then became a law. And now will go before the Supreme Court in March. And so it’ll be very interesting to hear from Senator Jackson. 
So those are some of our legislative speakers and there’s a few more to be there.
We have Claire Culwell and Melissa Ohden. They both have these incredibly inspiring stories. They both survived abortion, essentially. And their lives are such witnesses and so they’re going to share their stories. And, of course, we’ll link that very much to the born-alive discharge petition in the House. 
Right now we’ve got Jim Daly from Focus on the Family, Marjorie Dannenfelser, head of Susan B. Anthony List—a good year for Marjorie to speak with the theme. Another wonderful woman, she’s a pro-life leader in New Mexico, Lisa Martinez.
We also have a local pastor, David Platt from McLean Bible Church, a very well-known church here in the D.C. area. He will be doing our closing prayer. 
And, like I said, we’ve got a few more announcements. And I should say our favorite speaker, at least when we do our surveys after the March for Life, is almost always the young person that speaks because, of course, by and large the participants in the March for Life are young people. 
Our one specific designated young person who’s speaking this year is Catalina Scheider Galiñanes. And she is from Oakcrest, a school in Vienna, Virginia. She’s going to speak about why she’s pro-life.
Allen: Wow. So many amazing speakers. I really look forward myself to hearing many of them at the event on the 24th. 
People come to March for Life in Washington, D.C., from states all across America. What is that message or motivation that you are really hoping that marchers will take with them back to their home states and their communities?
Mancini: The March for Life is very interesting in that it’s a place to come and witness and testify to the beautiful inherent dignity of the unborn person. And yet, ironically, for those of us who participate in the march every year, it’s an opportunity for our own hearts and minds to be changed even more about this issue.
I’ll just give you a quick example of that … I know I’m kind of backing my way into the answer here, but I had a family member come and participate from out West last year and it was the first time he had come and he’s always been pro-life, but it was quite a sacrifice to come. 
He and his wife and one of his children came and had a really beautiful time. I think … his eyes were opened to the significance of the issue and perhaps his heart was changed even more in the direction of life.
And while he had a very busy schedule last year with having kind of a … I guess you could say a break from work for a few months as he was changing to a new job. This year, he’s again coming because he realized how important it is and it’s like, again, his own experience was changed and he wants to do more in his local community.
So what I would say is that the March for Life, again, while it’s a moment to testify and to give witness in the public square about the unborn, it also changes our own hearts. 
Our deepest hope as those of us who pull this event together is that marchers go back home and make a difference in their local community. Because if it’s just one day that we’re coming together and are really [having a] motivating and exciting day, then we’re not doing our job. The job is really recognizing that we each have a role to play in building a culture of life and to do that in the area where we are planted.
Allen: Speaking of working in that area where you’re planted, you all have also launched a number of marches across America in different cities. Why did you feel that it was important to not just have the national march but also to have marches in states across America?
Mancini: Well, a few years ago as a pro-life organization in D.C,. we found that we were being tapped to do all things and there was a bit of … mission creep even within the organization, not terribly so, but it allowed for some reflection. 
After some time I think we were all a little bit burned out and it gave us an opportunity to really look interiorly as well as look up to God and really think about why was the March created and what do we bring to the pro-life movement and to building a culture of life that no other pro-life group brings. 
So, what can we do better and more of to end abortion, to change hearts and minds so that abortion is unthinkable in our country? And simultaneously, if you were to ask us, “What is the single thing that you get the most calls about or the most questions about?” It was to help groups start marches in their states and in their local areas.
We didn’t really have the bandwidth to do that well. I mean, we had sort of a very informal toolkit and we take calls and try to give technical assistance, but for the most part, we weren’t really staffed up to be able to help groups do that in a powerful way. So all of that led to a lot of soul-searching and deep discernment with the board.
We decided to try as a beta test, a state march program. So our first state march was in Virginia last year and it was in April and we brought out over 7,000 people for it. And we’re the lead story on the Richmond Times-Dispatch, which is the local Richmond paper. And for so many reasons, it was a huge success and we didn’t quite anticipate that it would be as big of a success as it was. 
So this year we’ll have a second march in Virginia on Feb. 13. We’ll also have a march in Pennsylvania. That’s on May 18. And a march in Hartford, Connecticut, on April 15. Stay tuned for more announcements.
Allen: That’s so exciting. I do want to take just a moment to ask you to share a little bit about your own pro-life journey and how you got connected with March for Life.
Mancini: Oh, well, thank you for asking that. Well, let’s see. I grew up in a Catholic family and social justice and just understanding human dignity was something that was ingrained in my understanding of life and the most important things of life. … 
I was 1 of 5. So we loved life, my family, and definitely lived in a way that was very respectful of life. … 
After college, I did a volunteer corps, I did something called the Jesuit Volunteer Corps. I worked with young people that were in a crisis setting. They were in a youth crisis shelter. 
They were being moved either from a situation that wasn’t safe for them to be in or they’d been found on the streets. And there was a long-term search for more of a permanent home, whether that was going to be foster care or a residential treatment center or what have you. 
So my time working with those young people was very informative and I grappled a lot with the deeper questions about would it be better if some of these lives hadn’t been born? Is it unfair to bring some lives into the world when there’s such a difficult scenario and such heavy crosses that these people carry that nobody’s ever really meant to carry? 
Anyways, I did a lot of sort of introspection and I came out on the other side really recognizing that every life is a gift. And I guess realizing with humility, who am I to judge the value of someone’s life because they’ve had some hard things happen to them?
And then along the way I’ve had different experiences, obviously, in life. For certain one experience [that] weighs heavily on my heart is two people very close to me when I was in college decided to have an abortion and they didn’t tell me before, they told me after. And then in some cases it was a long time after. 
Just hearing the pain that they underwent was so sad and even this terrible guilt that they were experiencing. Of course, there’s always hope and healing. 
And I should say that to anyone listening to your podcast, anyone who’s been involved in abortion, there’s so many wonderful groups and people to speak with to find hope and healing after having been involved in abortion. 
But I just realized personally through these people who were close to me that women deserve so much better than abortion.
It was just a lived experience of what I’d always believed but I thought in a very sad reality in these situations. So, along the way there have been many different I guess you could say epiphanies throughout my life. 
And you asked how I ended up getting to the March for Life. So this is a very long-winded way of answering that. But I guess about 10 or 11 years ago, I was working with Family Research Council and I was their pro-life spokesperson and just loved that job. It was so fun and I got to do a lot of policy analysis, which is really what I love to do. 
So, a few years into that job, I was asked to join the board of the March for Life. And I did expecting just to be a board member for a period of time. But I never really made it to my first board meeting without a major happening. And that was that the founder of the March for Life, Nellie Gray, passed away before I went to my first board meeting. 
So my first board meeting was an emergency board meeting where we were coming up with a plan for how we were going to continue the march. 
In a short-term capacity, I and another board member, Patrick Kelly, took on the leadership and we thought we’d we had our plans for how that was going to happen and here I am seven and a half years later, still working with the March for Life. And lots has changed over that time. But it’s just been a big blessing.
Allen: Certainly. That’s so neat just to hear that background and your story and kind of see how all those pieces came together. It’s really, really neat.
Mancini:
Thank you.
Allen: Increasingly, unfortunately, we are seeing an attitude among the pro-choice movement. It is really not only pro-abortion but advocates flaunting abortion. And you know, we see this through the Shout Your Abortion movement, examples like actress Michelle Williams during her award acceptance speech at the Golden Globes. We could go on and on, but what should the response of pro-lifers be to this really blatantly pro-abortion rhetoric?
Mancini: I think a couple things. One is to just have great confidence in what we believe. So, to remember that reality is not arbitrary and that calling something a certain name or saying that something shouldn’t have stigma or shame or what have you doesn’t make it so. 
Abortion—whatever you’re going to call it, if you’re going to shout it, if you’re going to tell your story about it, etc.—always takes the life of one and most frequently wounds the life of another. So calling it something different doesn’t change that reality.
So I think just to A, recognize that. And then B—this might sound a little counterintuitive based on what I just said—to take a very merciful approach. 
I mean, look, we are in a culture of what I would describe as the walking wounded because so many women and men have been involved in abortion and that very much impacts their response to these kinds of things. There’s so much woundedness around it. And so I think approaching any conversations about this topic with a lot of mercy and love and tenderness is critical.
And … I feel that we don’t ever have to twist someone’s arm behind their back to agree with us because we should have so much confidence. 
Life is inherently beautiful and the pro-life message is so positive and attractive. So we really just need to show it for what it is instead of twisting someone’s arm behind their back if they don’t agree with us. 
Conversely, the more that we understand about the abortion industry and even abortion procedures, it’s dark. I mean, it’s really, really dark. So to the extent that we can show that reality for what it is as well, and certainly try to prevent people from any kind of pain and loss of life. I think that’s important too.
Allen: President [Donald] Trump is often referred to as the most pro-life president in history. Looking back at his first three years in office, what, to you, are some of the most notable pro-life victories of his administration?
Mancini: Oh, that’s a great question. In terms of really creating pro-life policy, I would agree he has done more for the pro-life movement than any president when it comes to enacting policy. 
Because of my job, I have to just start by talking about the March for Life. Prior to the Trump administration, we never had a president or vice president of the United States come to the march. In fact, a speech writer once told me, and this was a former speech writer, that presidents were counseled to go to Camp David around the time of the March for Life because they didn’t want to be photoed with some graphic images or something like that. 
So … there’s almost been a real fear at top levels to associate with something this important. And we’ve seen the opposite from this White House. And it’s been incredible.
I will never, ever, ever forget one week after being inaugurated, there was the vice president in person at the March for Life and Kellyanne Conway, who ran a successful campaign. And that was, again, the first time. 
It was a historic moment because it was the first time ever in the history of a March [for Life] that a standing vice president had come and spoken in person. 
Then the following year, President Trump addressed the marchers about a mile away from the rally. So he was in the Rose Garden and there were a couple hundred young people there in the Rose Garden with him on big jumbotrons at the rally’s site. We broadcast that live and that was very exciting. 
Last year, again, we had Mrs. [Karen] Pence and the vice president. So it’s just been incredible to have that level of support from the administration.
But in terms of amazing policies that they’ve enacted—gosh, there’s been so much. One of my personal favorites is the Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance policy that had been formerly called the Mexico City policy, but that’s been reinstated and broadened. 
Another favorite, of course, would be Supreme Court appointments, nominations and confirmations of both Justice [Neil] Gorsuch and [Justice Brett] Kavanaugh. 
And then all of the excellent judicial nominations that are going to be at the appeals court and the district court, I think there have been over 218 of those. I don’t have the number right in front of me, but it’s high. 
Returning Title 10 funding decisions to the state, launching an investigation into Planned Parenthood. I mean, again and again, there have been so many really, really great things.
Allen: Yeah. And just earlier this month, over 200 members of Congress signed an amicus brief asking the Supreme Court to reconsider Roe v. Wade. 
Of course, like you mentioned, we’ve seen all of these great new policies and legislation come out of the Trump administration. Also … 2019 did see some really devastating pro-choice legislation pushed forward. So what do you think we can expect in 2020?
Mancini: That’s a great question. Well, I think that some of the things that we need to think about are, first of all, the election. And the March for Life doesn’t endorse candidates, but we do educate. And I think that elections matter. 
I know having worked in the Office of the Secretary at HHS [the Department of Health and Human Services] and seeing all of the policies change—I was there during the Bush administration and then in the beginning of the Obama administration—I just have to say the pro-life vote makes such a difference. 
So, elections matter and to prepare well for the election ahead because it’s going to be a big year. That’s one thing. 
I know that something that we are very much focusing on at the March for Life this year is the born-alive discharge petition and just the born-alive troops.
You mentioned that there have been so many extreme laws enacted at the state, though. Of course, Illinois now passed the Reproductive Act, which makes it sort of the most pro-abortion state in our country. New York, of course, did last year. Vermont passed another similar law. 
Essentially, it’s just so critical that we’re aware of these kinds of things and that we do as much as we possibly can to message on the truth about things like the born-alive discharge petition or born-alive bills at the level of the state by the ERA, etc., etc. …
You asked the question and it’s a little hard to know [what to expect this year]. The elections are in front of us. We have a mixed Senate and House, so it’s hard to pass the federal legislation right now. And then in the states there’s all sorts of different things happening. 
So to fight the extreme stuff, especially in places like Virginia, my own home state, and we’re seeing the ERA [Equal Rights Amendment] is going to get voted on soon there, but to continue as much as we possibly can to pass good pro-life legislation, for example, the Born-Alive [Abortion Survivors Protection] Act, which any person with common sense would agree with.
Allen: And you recently co-authored a commentary for The Daily Signal titled “Early Feminists Were Right About Unborn Human Life.” Can you tell us a little bit more about these American suffragists?
Mancini: I would love to. To the best of my knowledge, I don’t think that there is even one suffragist who was pro-abortion. 
So we’ve got some fantastic quotes from, for example, Alice Paul, who called abortion the ultimate exploitation of women. Elizabeth Cady Stanton was very strong in her views on this. Of course, Susan B. Anthony, etc. 
But these early female pioneers, again, knew that a woman’s capacity for fertility and motherhood wasn’t a liability, but that it was a beautiful thing. I think they saw men and women as being equal in dignity but different not having to do away with the part of them that can make them mothers. 
So it’s wonderful to look back and to see sort of this first wave of feminists and where they were coming from and their understanding of these kinds of issues. And then to see sort of where things are today and how far we’ve gotten from that. 
For any of your listeners who have an interest in that, I cannot highly recommend enough coming to our conference the day before the March for Life. 
Our keynote is one of my favorite speakers, especially on this topic. Erika Bachiochi—she’s a pro-life feminist and a legal scholar at the Ethics and Public Policy Center. And she’s got so much to say about this and herself has a tremendous testimony and story of coming from a more pro-abortion feminist perspective to where she is today.
And then we have a stellar lineup of panelists, very much speaking to different nuances about this. Sue Ellen Browder will be speaking, she’s an author, she wrote a wonderful book called “Subverted.” Now she’s got a book coming out called “Sex and the Catholic Feminist.” She’s essentially going to go into this question that you just asked me, what the early suffragettes said and a history of that. She’ll read quotes and papers, etc. 
We also have Christina Francis, OB-GYN, who’s the chairman of the board of AAPLOG, the American Association of Pro-life OB-GYNs, and she’s going to talk about the consequences of abortion and especially the physiological consequences.
We also have Mary McCluskey, who works with Project Rachel Ministry on helping women and men who regret having been involved in abortion. And then Brandi Swindell, who’s the founder and CEO of Stanton Healthcare—named after Elizabeth Cady Stanton, of course, an early suffragist. 
So I highly recommend coming in and hearing about our theme.
Allen: And how can our listeners find out more about the march that’s happening in D.C. and then the state marches that are going to be taking place throughout this year?
Mancini: Well, follow us on all of our different mediums on social media, and check us out particularly on our website at marchforlife.org, and you can count down the hours, like you mentioned, Virginia, right at the beginning.
Allen: Yeah. Thank you so much,
Jeanne. We just really appreciate your time.
Mancini: Thanks for having me. It’s been a pleasure.

"President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un stand on North Korean soil at the Demilitarized Zone on June 30, 2019. (Photo: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images)

Olivia Enos is an Asian Studies Center senior policy analyst within The Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy at The Heritage Foundation.
“If you step forward, you will be the first U.S. president to cross the border,” said Kim Jong Un through a translator to President Donald Trump on Sunday. 
The two men stood at the Demilitarized Zone on the border of North and South Korea. That moment made history. 
The question is: Will it have a significant impact on stalled negotiations?
Diplomacy between the two leaders seemed to have hit a roadblock since the Hanoi summit in February, which ended abruptly when the two leaders left Vietnam without a deal. The swirl of summitry that began in Singapore last year has, so far, resulted in little progress. 
To put a
finer point on it, North Korea is no closer to complete, verifiable,
irreversible dismantlement of its nuclear program than it was prior to the
first meeting between Trump and Kim. For that matter, it is also failing to
improve its egregious track record of human rights abuse.
Sunday’s last-minute meeting between Trump and Kim was prompted by a presidential tweet. This set into motion a photo op that handed Kim yet another legitimizing appearance on the world stage without having made any major concessions in negotiations.
The
primary deliverable from Sunday’s meeting was a promise to resume working-level
negotiations. While this is a positive development, it’s hardly a promise
worthy of fanfare. 
Kim is a brutal dictator—one who imprisons between 80,000 and 120,000 people in political prison camps, murders people in broad daylight for merely possessing a Bible, and restricts all of the freedoms that Americans hold so dear. That’s to say nothing of its illegal nuclear and missile programs.
Kim, no doubt, desires legitimacy. Every time the two leaders meet and Kim makes no concessions, he is emboldened to press the U.S. to accept North Korea as a nuclear power, and for that matter, a legitimate state—of which it is neither.
Following the historic meeting at the DMZ, there are now rumblings that the administration might be considering a “freeze for freeze”—essentially, North Korea freezing its nuclear program in exchange for the U.S. lifting some of the tougher sanctions on Pyongyang. 
This would essentially acknowledge North Korea as a nuclear state, something that negotiators refused to do in previous negotiations. 
This would
be a mistake. A freeze-for-freeze would undermine the most successful pillar of
the Trump administration’s North Korea strategy—the maximum pressure policy—and
would fall short of legally-required standards that North Korea denuclearize
prior to getting sanctions relief. 
This is not the first time diplomacy has impacted the maximum pressure policy. 
After the Singapore summit, Russia and China reportedly began easing implementation of their sanctions—sanctions that North Korea acknowledged helped bring them to the negotiating table in Hanoi. Kim would like nothing more than to see these sanctions lifted.
Now that
the DMZ meeting has happened, the question is, “Where do we go from here?” 
U.S. negotiators should use working-level dialogue to press North Korea to accept the legally-required definition of denuclearization and to lay out a step-by-step process to irreversibly dismantle its nuclear program. 
And, rather than viewing human rights as an afterthought, the administration should press for improvements to human rights, recognizing that the Kim regime uses human rights abuses to retain power for itself and continue its nuclear and missile programs. 
Going forward, the administration should articulate a comprehensive strategy where both national security and human rights challenges are addressed in tandem. It should refrain from high-level, diplomatic photo ops that bring us no closer to solving these problems.

"An opinion from Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas tying abortion to eugenics ""keeps truth, hope, and justice alive,"" Alveda King tells The Daily Signal. (Photo: Prince Williams / Contributor/Getty Images)
Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas is right to call out some abortions as a form of eugenics, a niece of civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr. told The Daily Signal.
Thomas’ concern, expressed in a Supreme Court opinion Tuesday, is not only relevant but “keeps truth, hope, and justice alive,” Alveda King said the next day in a phone interview.
“It is so important and it’s so true that abortion is eugenics,” King said when asked about Thomas’ opinion. “And Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, basically said colored people were like weeds and need to be exterminated.”
Thomas made his comments in a concurring opinion as the high court upheld an Indiana law requiring abortion providers to bury or cremate fetal remains, but declined to review another Indiana law banning abortions on the basis of sex, race, or disability.
“Given the potential for abortion to become a tool of eugenic manipulation, the Court will soon need to confront the constitutionality of laws like Indiana’s,” Thomas wrote. 
Nevertheless, Thomas wrote that he joined fellow justices in deciding not to hear arguments on the Indiana law banning selective abortions until more lower courts had addressed the issue. 
In his opinion, Thomas traced the intertwined history of abortion, eugenics, and Planned Parenthood, which grew into the nation’s largest abortion provider.
King, a former Georgia state legislator, is now director of civil rights for the unborn at the organization Priests for Life.
She told The Daily Signal that “evidence of a eugenics effort” could be seen in Planned Parenthood founder Sanger’s “Birth Control League, her Negro Project, [and] giving free vasectomies and free tubal ligations to colored people, [as] they called us back then.”
Eugenics is a way of controlling reproduction so that only “desired” populations produce offspring, and not “undesired” ones. 
Abortion has made eugenics more palatable to American society, Thomas wrote. 
“The individualized nature of abortion gives it even more eugenic potential than birth control, which simply reduces the chance of conceiving any child,” the 70-year-old justice wrote, adding that “abortion has proved to be a disturbingly effective tool for implementing the discriminatory preferences that undergird eugenics.”
Sanger reportedly ran in Ku Klux Klan circles and she wrote about meeting with the white supremacy organization in her autobiography.
 But King, whose father A.D. King also was a Baptist minister and civil rights leader, said Sanger’s involvement with the Klan and eugenics has fallen under the radar. 
“Margaret Sanger herself was a consultant for the Ku Klux Klan [and] we know that part of the agenda of Planned Parenthood has always been—and the abortion lobby—is to minimize and control the African-American population and other minority populations,” King said.    
Those who claim to fight for “women’s rights” need to be sure they are not neglecting others’ right to life, she said. 
“Passion sometimes can be clouded by emotion, and that way, it’s not always as helpful as it’s desired or intended to be,” King said.
“And so when you are trying to give rights to women, the emotional pull on that forgets the civil rights of the child and the person in the womb, because sometimes emotion can cloud genuine compassion and action.”

Immigration is one of the fundamental building blocks that help
make America the unique nation that it is.
But the debate over border security and immigration has become
toxic because politicians have put politics before principles. And reasonable
Americans find themselves trapped between zealots on both sides.
For over two centuries, the United States has welcomed millions of people from every corner of the globe. And today, we lawfully admit over 1 million people every year. That is more than any other country in the world.
The debate is not about whether we should allow immigration—it’s about how we do so in a way that protects American sovereignty, respects the rule of law, and is beneficial to all Americans.
So what does a thoughtful agenda for American immigration reform
look like?
Here are four guiding principles:
1. We must respect the consent of the governed—that is, the will of the people.
Individuals who are not citizens do not have a right to American citizenship without the consent of the American people. That consent is expressed through the laws of the United States.
Through those laws, we the people invite individuals from other
countries, under certain conditions, to join us as residents and fellow
citizens. 
2. We cannot compromise national security and public safety.
Every nation has the right, recognized by both international and
domestic law, to secure its borders and ports of entry and control what and who
is coming into its country. 
A disorganized and chaotic immigration system encourages people
to go around the law and is a clear invitation to those who wish to take
advantage of our openness to harm the nation. 
Secure borders, especially in a time of terrorist threat, are
crucial to American national security.
3. Becoming a citizen means becoming an American. We must preserve patriotic assimilation.
The founding principles of this nation imply that an individual of any ethnic heritage or racial background can become an American. That’s why we have always welcomed immigrants seeking the promises and opportunities of the American dream.
Patriotic assimilation is the bond that allows America to be a
nation of immigrants. Without it, we cease to be a country with a distinct
character, becoming instead a hodgepodge of different groups.
If we are to be a united nation, living up to our motto of e pluribus unum—out of many, one—we all must understand and embrace a common language, history, and civic culture.
And that not only benefits America, but also those immigrants and
their families who aspire to prosper here.
4. Our lawmakers must respect the rule of law, and immigration is no exception.
Failure to enforce our immigration laws is unfair to those who
obey the law and follow the rules to enter the country legally.
Those who enter and remain in the country illegally should not
be rewarded with legal status or other benefits. When politicians condone such
behavior they only encourage further illegal conduct.
Based on these principles, immigration reform should include transitioning to a merit-based system. We should end practices like chain migration, birthright citizenship, the visa lottery, arbitrary per-country immigration caps, and any form of amnesty for those here illegally.
We must close loopholes that prevent enforcement of our laws and
have overwhelmed immigration courts, allowing illegitimate asylum claimants and
other lawbreakers to remain in the U.S. indefinitely.
And we must take on these issues one by one. A comprehensive “deal” subjects the fate of policies with universal appeal to the fate of the most controversial topics. The key is to begin by working on the solutions on which most Americans agree.
We must and can address this issue in a manner that is fair, responsible, humane, and prudent. This is too important an issue to not get right and too important an issue to be driven by partisan agendas.
Let’s stay focused on what is best for the welfare of all Americans, both those of today and those of the future.

This week, as Americans commemorate Independence Day and the creation of the most free, most prosperous nation on earth, we will inevitably hear from those who say there’s no reason to celebrate a country where not everyone gained their freedom or their equality in 1776. 
They will say that a nation stained with the evil of slavery, a nation that once refused women and blacks the right to vote or hold property, isn’t a nation worth lauding.
As a woman and as a black person who lived through segregation, I have experienced both the inequality and the opportunity of this nation. 
As a student of history and as someone who works with governments around the world, I know how women and minorities are treated in other societies compared to the United States. 
Because of these experiences, I want to tell you exactly why America is worth celebrating.
Despite their flawed nature as human beings, our Founders laid out principles for forming a nation based on humanity’s highest ideals. Nowhere else on earth had that ever been done before. 
Those founding principles have guided this nation and created a framework that allows society to recognize the error of its ways.
The fact is, we abolished slavery. We even fought a war over it. We ultimately recognized women’s and minorities’ right to vote, to own property, and to have the full and equal rights of any other citizen. 
We have endeavored through our laws and our actions to eradicate the unequal treatment and marginalization of fellow Americans because of their ethnicity, religion, politics, or other characteristics.
July 4, 1776—and the principles that day epitomized—began the foundation for a nation that would right its own wrongs.
The unfortunate reality is that we had to grow into our principles. The Founders knew what we aspired to be, but the country wasn’t there yet and even today, we still have a ways to go. 
In fact, every Founder admitted in his writings that slavery contradicted the equality principle of the Declaration of Independence. 
They knew that it would be a journey for us to fully realize our ideals, but they set a course for achieving them, and every generation since has been working to advance them. 
That’s what has made America the unique and wonderful nation that it is.
I love America not only because we’ve grown to rectify many of our wrongs, but also because we’ve been an incredibly positive force for good. 
We’ve built a free and prosperous nation where anyone has the opportunity to thrive and live out their dreams. We’ve also shared that gift with the world, helping others to achieve the same.
Despite that success, we continue to hear from the “America is irreparably flawed” crowd that our freedom and free market system only bring opportunity to the wealthy and well connected. They claim that the system just makes the rich richer and the poor poorer.
The reality is exactly the opposite: Capitalism has done more to lift people out of poverty than any other economic system in history. 
Plain and simple, over the last 25 years, it has been free markets that have cut the global poverty rate by two-thirds. 
In the United States, every segment of the population—including women, minorities, and even the lowest income earners—have seen their incomes rise and their opportunities grow.
Realizing that people around the world deserve the same blessings of freedom and prosperity that we have, Americans work through our government, nonprofits, and private charities to spread these blessings to other countries. 
We’ve even helped others fight for their very freedom—from both world wars to peacekeeping missions around the world. 
Despite the leftists who call our nation imperialist, when we help other countries defeat tyrants or repel invaders, we don’t use the opportunity to conquer them and build an empire. Rather, we help them to rebuild and become self-sufficient.
These are all proofs of a nation reaching for its highest ideals.
While it took too long to correct many of America’s early injustices, and while we will always be a work in progress, our founding principles themselves created the framework that has allowed us to solve some of our biggest issues. 
While not perfect, we are a great force for good that works to bring freedom, prosperity, and that problem-solving ability to our own land and to others that want to replicate them. This is all part of what we are celebrating on Independence Day.
Alexis de Tocqueville said admiringly of America, “The greatness of America lies not in being more enlightened than any other nation, but rather in her ability to repair her faults.” His words still ring true almost 200 years later.
So, on this Independence Day, I encourage you to join me in watching fireworks, eating hot dogs and apple pie, proudly celebrating America, and continuing to work toward the vision of the nation our Founders thought we could be.
Happy Independence Day!

Adorned
with bright smiles and clothed in colorful garb, Uighur Muslims held in
political reeducation camps flash across the screen as they sing and dance
triumphantly to the words that President Xi Jinping wrote just for them. 
These sights,
captured by the BBC, are what the Chinese government
wants journalists and the outside world to see. 
No amount
of colorful displays of political allegiance, however, can hide the reality: Not
one of these people is in a political reeducation facility of their own accord.

One
interchange in the video is especially telling. The BBC reporter asks one of
the men whether it was his choice to be in a political reeducation facility.
“Yes,” he replies. “A policeman at my village told me to get enrolled in the
school and transform my thoughts.”
The reporter also speaks to Chinese officials. Nearly every one alludes to the notion that the roughly 800,000 to 1 million people interned in Xinjiang are affected by religious extremism and in need of reeducation so that their thinking aligns with the Chinese Communist Party.  
The
conflation of religion with extremism took shape in new regulations instituted
in February of last year. These regulations continue the government’s practice
of “Sinicizing”—or secularizing—religion, so that it conforms to the core
tenets of the Communist Party.
In
addition to “thought transformation,” people in these facilities must undergo
Mandarin lessons, self-criticism sessions, forced labor, and even torture. Occasionally,
there are deaths. 
So-called vocational training is a core component of most inmates’ curriculum. One Chinese official in the report explained that inmates spend between two to four months learning how to do simple tasks like making a bed. 
The
reality—which was not shown in the report—is that these people are subject to forced labor,
producing goods that likely make their way into U.S. supply chains. 
One case reported by the Associated Press suggests that Badger Sportswear, a North Carolina-based company, had its supply chain tainted with goods produced by a Chinese business, Hetian Taida Apparel, which shares warehouses with a political reeducation facility in Xinjiang. 
If the allegations are true, Badger Sportswear may face repercussions for importing goods produced with forced labor into the U.S.
The BBC
reporter notes up front that the facilities they were permitted to visit were
cleaned up for journalists’ prying eyes. Satellite images showed that prior to
the BBC’s visit, watchtowers and barbed wire were removed from the premises and
barren outdoor spaces were transformed into sports facilities.
Documentaries like this one are incredibly important to building a human rights case against the Chinese government. They provide additional evidence, especially of what the Chinese government wants the outside world to see. 
Such evidence augments the troves of satellite imagery collected over the last several years and eye-witness testimony of former prisoners, who can testify that these facilities are far from benign.
The existence of these facilities and the hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people arbitrarily detained within their walls is now irrefutable. Which raises the question: How will the world respond?
Earlier this year, The Heritage Foundation released a cutting-edge report on the crisis in Xinjiang. The report called on the U.S. government and the international community to move beyond mere condemnation to craft a swift response to the atrocities transpiring in western China. 
The report notes that this is not merely an isolated human rights crisis, but a crisis with national security implications. 
China’s rapid internment of potentially millions of Uighur Muslims is made possible by a draconian use of surveillance technology—the kind that China is already exporting across the globe to countries in Africa, Latin America, and Europe.
The U.S.
and the international community should unite around several key solutions,
including levying sanctions against those responsible for China’s police state
in Xinjiang and Tibet, and preventing the export of Chinese surveillance
technology to our countries.
The time
to act was yesterday, but in lieu of inaction, the U.S. should seek to build a coalition of the willing to address these blatant human
rights abuses perpetrated by the Chinese government.

Last year, I had the privilege of taking a private tour of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum’s Americans and the Holocaust exhibit. The purpose of the exhibit is to highlight the role of average Americans and their response to the events of the Holocaust.
As I wandered the halls of the museum, my eyes were drawn to articles from World War II highlighting Kristallnacht and the concentration camps of Nazi Germany. But nothing was more stunning than the row of miniature suitcases lined up—each one representing 1,000 Jewish people (mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, grandmothers, grandfathers) who sought asylum in the United States.
The exhibit transitioned quickly from the reality of the needs (hundreds of thousands seeking asylum) to the U.S. response. American journalists wrote droves of articles; student groups lobbied; and Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau, the lone Jewish member of FDR’s Cabinet, paved the way for the creation of the War Refugee Board that resulted in more than 100,000 European Jews being resettled in the U.S. and ultimately spared during the Holocaust.
Now, instead of witnessing the assault of the German government on Jewish people, the American people are watching history repeat itself, as another government—this time, China—launches an all-out assault on the Muslim religious minority Uighurs.
The breakneck speed with which the Chinese government has collectivized and interred what is now believed to be 1.8 million Muslims in political reeducation camps is breathtaking.
The facts are now undeniable.
The recent leak of classified data from China by The New York Times confirmed the existence of a vast web of political prison camps that Xinjiang expert Adrian Zenz of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation now believes number between 1,300 and 1,400.
The data leak, now termed the Xinjiang Papers, traces the massive repression and internment directly to the very top of the Chinese political system. There can be no doubt that Xi Jinping created, sold, and orchestrated this modern phenomenon in partnership with Xinjiang Party Secretary Chen Quanguo. 
The proposal of mass collectivization and arbitrary detention of nearly 2 million people was apparently objected to by some members of the Chinese Communist Party. The Xinjiang Papers reveals that those who objected were subsequently purged.
There is no shortage of reasons why anyone might object to these camps. Prisoners in the camps are subject to reeducation reminiscent of the Cultural Revolution. Forced to recant their religious beliefs or at least make them conform with the CCP’s ends, they are also induced to forsake their native language in favor of Mandarin. 
New reports indicate that individuals in the camps may be subject to forced sterilization and are injected with unknown substances to be experimented on like lab rats. Torture is increasingly reported, and some have even died while in custody.
While Chinese authorities have sought to sell reeducation camps as vocational training centers that Uighurs graduate from and go on to live so-called reformed lives, what that means in practice are countless Uighurs missing, their family members lucky enough to be abroad calling attention to their cases and even starting a Twitter campaign, #StillNoInfo, as they search for those still missing. 
It also means well-educated Uighurs being forced to trade in their white-collar jobs for work in factories that leave them dependent on the Chinese state for their income.
What sets collectivization of the Uighurs apart from previous periods of collectivization, both in China, but also in other parts of the world, is the rapid pace in which it took place.
The speed at which such a large population of people could be uprooted from their homes and extrajudicially interned was made possible principally through surveillance technology—technology that, according to Human Rights Watch, deems it suspicious to exit out the back door rather than the front door of your home, and sees attendance at mosque as grounds for interrogation or internment. 
Normal human behavior, to live one’s life according to one’s closely-held beliefs, is seen as threatening the Chinese Communist Party, to whom the state supersedes all other allegiances.
In the face of such atrocities, it is easy for individuals and governments to feel paralyzed. After all, how does one respond to such distortions of human existence like the Holocaust, genocide in Rwanda, Darfur or Burma, or the gulags of the Soviet Union?
The Americans and the Holocaust exhibit really was a charge to all Americans.
To the American people—who among you will call on your elected leaders to respond? Who will be a good neighbor? Even to your neighbor across the Pacific.
Will you be there for them in their time of need?
To the students—who will organize student groups and events to raise awareness?
To civil society—Who will write the articles and document the evidence for future justice? Who will hold prayer meetings? Who will support local Uighurs recently resettled in the United States as they mourn lost family members or try to find those still missing?
To the U.S. government—who will be the next Henry Morgenthau?
The American people have a beautiful penchant for loving and caring—a philanthropic spirit, as it is often described. This is because U.S. leaders such as Ronald Reagan called us to our better selves—to be that shining city on a hill—in whatever form that looks like in the present.
Persecution of the Uighurs demands a strong U.S. response, but as illustrated in the case of the Holocaust, it took pressure from the American people, from civil society, and leaders in the U.S. government to be willing to lead and do what it is possible for the United States to do to serve those in need in the face of such earth-shattering atrocities.
Doing what is possible means advancing freedom and values in Asia.
Doing what is possible means sanctioning Chen Quanguo.
Doing what is possible may involve granting priority refugee resettlement status to Uighurs.
In the face of such severe human rights violations, the United States should not miss this opportunity to demonstrate its commitment to freedom wherever it is challenged. Today, it’s in China.

Hong Kong protests turned violent as demonstrators took to the streets on Tuesday, the day marking the 70th anniversary of Communist Party rule in China.
And, for the first time since protests began early this year, a Hong Kong police officer shot and wounded a protester amid a skirmish between the demonstrators and security forces. Video of the shooting spread quickly on the internet. Thankfully, the student is stabilized.
The shot itself represented the sharpest uptick in violence since the protests began. But Monday night’s protests were also among the more violent and stood in sharp contrast to what have been, thus far, largely peaceful efforts to ensure the long-term preservation of fundamental freedoms in Hong Kong. 
The police official who fired the shot
claimed self-defense, saying that he thought his life was in danger. The shot
was reportedly fired amid a standoff in which protesters allegedly hit security
officials with metal pipes, while others are said to have swarmed, tackled, and
beat up another riot officer. 
In addition to that incident, many news
agencies reported an overall uptick in violence, with protesters throwing gasoline bombs in subway
stations, throwing rocks at windows, and
damaging private property.
Regardless of the circumstances that led to the 18-year-old student protester getting shot, though not fatally, many in Hong Kong and the international community will see this as a clear-cut case of police brutality and a misuse of force. 
Hong Kong’s “shot heard around the world” will hopefully lead the special administrative region’s authorities to finally undertake an independent inquiry into police brutality. That’s something that protesters have made repeated requests for and clearly the thing that could best calm the situation. 
>>> ‘We Are Facing One of the Biggest Authoritarian States’: A Hong Kong Politician Speaks Out
Demonstrators first took to the streets
earlier this year in response to the Legislative Council’s proposed extradition
bill, which, if passed, would have permitted individuals to be extradited to
China at Beijing’s request. 
The proposed bill—which was tabled and
then later fully withdrawn by Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam—posed an
existential threat to the rule of law there. 
The withdrawal of the bill was a notable success for protesters, but came at the 11th hour and was perceived as too little, too late by many in Hong Kong. In spite of the bill’s withdrawal, protests continued. And as demonstrations continued, demands grew.
While, initially, protesters simply wanted the extradition bill fully withdrawn, their demands have since increased from one to five. They now include a call for an independent inquiry into police violence, amnesty for all protesters, universal suffrage, and a request that protests not be referred to as “riots.” 
Some have also called for the removal of Lam from office. 
>>> Protests Escalate in Hong Kong
The U.S. should continue to be
supportive of peaceful protests and urge restraint on both sides. 
Violence is rarely an effective way to secure liberty, and protesters who have taken to the streets in defense of the rule of law and freedom do their cause a disservice by flouting the rule of law themselves. 
The international community should also send an unequivocal signal that it will not tolerate police brutality in Hong Kong. It could do so by supporting calls for an independent inquiry into the conduct of security forces. 
There have been a number of instances over the past several weeks and months in which protesters sustained serious harm at the hands of the Hong Kong security forces. It’s a complicated situation, and the emotions at play are intense. 
>>> What Hong Kong Unrest Tells Us About China’s Plans for the Rest of the World
Whatever the events that have led to the current impasse between protesters and police, however, the reputation of the police must be restored. 
It is difficult to see how that happens
without systematically and independently addressing the grievances that have
accumulated since the protests started.

On “Problematic Women,” we often talk about the widely misunderstood gender pay gap. But this week, we discuss another “gap”—the alleged beauty gap, and whether women are treated differently in the workplace based on their looks.
We also discuss Planned Parenthood’s sky-is-falling rhetoric after the organization voluntarily removed itself from the Title X funding program, and the dating site OKCupid claiming in a tweet, “Girls don’t want flowers and chocolates—girls want someone who supports reproductive rights.”
Finally, we sit down with Olivia Enos, senior policy analyst for the Asian Studies Center at The Heritage Foundation, to discuss the Hong Kong protests and how women, in particular, have been involved.

Despite more than 20 family reunions held among divided families in South Korea and North Korea, not a single formal family reunion has taken place between Korean Americans and relatives in North Korea. 
More
than 100,000 divided family members were residing
in the U.S. in 2000, but now many of them are deceased, and only a few thousand
are left. Time is running out.
In
light of these significant challenges, Congress sprang into action.
The House Foreign Affairs Committee passed the Divided Families Reunification Act (H.R. 1771) with bipartisan support on Oct. 30. It awaits a vote in the full House. 
The bill would direct the State Department and the U.S. special envoy on North Korea human rights to prioritize reunions of Korean American divided families and their family members in North Korea.
The
term “divided family” refers to those who are separated from their relatives
due to the division of the Korean Peninsula. That tragic separation has lasted
for more than 60 years. 
Many
of them are not even sure whether their loved ones are still alive. According
to the Ministry of Unification in South Korea, 133,361 people are registered in the Divided
Family Information System. 
Divided families are classified into four groups: 
The
House Foreign Affairs Committee’s recent attention is nothing new. Congress has long sought to shed light on this
pressing issue. 
In 2007, the Congressional Commission on Divided Families was founded. Since then, the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal 2008 (H.R. 4986, Section 1265) was passed by Congress and signed into law by President George W. Bush. It required the president to report to Congress on necessary governmental efforts to facilitate family reunions.
Congress also discussed calling on the
U.S. special representative on North Korea policy to prioritize the divided-family
issue and to designate a coordinator for the families, if necessary. 
Historically, it has been a lack of political will at the executive branch level in Washington and Pyongyang that has stymied progress. Most recently, family reunions were not raised at either of the U.S.-North Korea summits in Singapore or Hanoi. 
When
the Voice of America asked about the possibility of family
reunions after the Singapore summit, the State Department just repeated a perfunctory
statement that it was committed to building a close relationship with North
Korea for peace and prosperity. 
North
Korea has made a limited number of statements on family reunions. In August
2017, North Korea’s Permanent Mission to the United Nations sent a letter to the Northern California
Council of Korean Americans from North Korea saying that it would actively
support the association’s family-reunion projects. 
However,
it has never led to a government-to-government agreement. If the subject of
family reunions is broached during negotiations, it’s highly likely that Pyongyang
will seek compensation in return for hosting reunions, an unreasonable demand the
U.S. is unlikely to meet.
Still, that shouldn’t prevent the Trump administration from trying. As it considers issues to prioritize, the reunion of Korean American divided families should be on the list, especially given the time-sensitive nature of the challenge. 
Working-level talks between the U.S. and North Korean counterparts in Stockholm in October ended with no agreement. Talks remain stalled, but if they resume, hosting family reunions might be a small issue where Washington and Pyongyang can make progress and maintain momentum in negotiations.
Family
reunions may also provide an opportunity for Seoul and Washington to work
together. The South Korean government has years of experience hosting family
reunions with North Korea and may be able to assist the U.S. as it considers a
tenable process to start hosting family reunions. 
The
reunification of ethnic-Korean families, especially those involving Americans,
should be a priority for policymakers. Congress deserves high marks for helping
make it one.

Unknown
pills and forced injections. 
Those
are not fictional horrors from scary movies, but the reality many Uighurs in
mass arbitrary internment are faced with today in China.
In
Xinjiang, human rights abuses against Uighur women and children abound. 
Uighurs,
a predominantly Turkic-speaking ethnic minority in Xinjiang, are being
seriously repressed by the Chinese government. Since 2017, more
than 1 million Muslim minorities, including Uighurs, have
been taken to detention without any
proper trials. 
Detainees are
forced to show their loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party and deny their Islamic
faith. Forced
labor and torture are
common.
Uighur
women testify to the horrors they have endured, including new reports of forced
sterilization. One Uighur woman interviewed by
French television said she was constantly injected with a substance during her
detention that stopped her periods. 
Mihrigul
Tursun, another Uighur woman now living in exile in the U.S., first testified before
the Congressional Executive Commission on China last November. This month, she raised
alarm over forced sterilization again at Amnesty
International’s conference in Tokyo.
She had
been detained in a re-education camp three separate times and said the
officials forced the Uighur women to take unknown drugs and drink some kind of
white liquid. Those caused them to lose consciousness and sometimes to lose
menstruation. 
Some of
the Uighur women even died from extreme bleeding. 
After coming to the U.S., Tursun underwent a proper medical examination, which confirmed her worst fears. She had in fact been sterilized and would never be able to bear children again.
She added triplets that she had given birth to prior to internment underwent an unknown surgery without any consent during her detention. One of them died, and the other two still have health problems.
While reports of human rights violations in the camps are a dime a dozen, Chinese officials continue to insist that they are just re-educating Uighurs to protect the region from Islamist attacks. 
Shohrat Zakir, Xinjiang’s Uighur governor, defended the practices as vocational training for Uighurs by comparing them with boarding schools. But these are no boarding schools.
Uighur repression is one component of the Chinese Communist Party’s “Sinicization” policy. Since Chinese President Xi Jinping took power, the party has sought to make religion conform to the party’s doctrine and Han-ethnicity customs.  
The Chinese
Communist Party also threatens future generations of Uighurs. Children whose
parents are detained in the camps are often sent to state-run
orphanages and brainwashed to
forget their ethnic roots. 
Even if
their parents are not detained, Uighur children need to move to inner China and
immerse themselves into Han culture under the Chinese government’s “Xinjiang
classrooms” policy.
The reports of forced sterilization are leading many to fear
complete cultural genocide of the Uighur population. 
Genocide is defined in both international law and U.S. law as the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, an ethnic, racial, religious, or political group. According to international law, an attempt to restrict births and forcibly moving children to another group are two methods a country can employ to carry out genocide. 
The international community should be alarmed that China is destroying an ethnic minority by infringing on its personal decisions related to family planning and religious freedom.
One of the reasons the U.S. withdrew its funding from the
United Nations Population Fund was China’s coercive family-planning policies
that restrict the number of children the average Chinese family can have to
two. 
Driven by concerns that China was using money from the U.N. Population Fund to carry out forced abortions, the Trump administration pulled all U.N. Population Fund funding, as recommended in a Heritage Foundation  report. 
The U.S. should consider additional steps it
can take to respond to the Xinjiang crisis, especially anything that it can do
to respond to reports of forced sterilization. 
As Tursun mentioned in her testimony, Uighurs “look to the
United States as the beacon of hope for the oppressed people around the world.”

Now is the time for the U.S. and the international community
to respond to the crisis in Xinjiang with strong resolve.

For six months, China has been the focus of international criticism over deteriorating freedoms in Hong Kong, but the Chinese Communist Party’s intransigence regarding liberty in Hong Kong is only one of myriad repressive campaigns that the world should oppose.
People
in Hong Kong possess far greater freedom of expression and speech than those in
mainland China. So, as Hong Kongers protest China’s violation of their rights,
they also shed light on the gravity of the repression of Chinese people on the
mainland. 
There are hundreds of millions of people in mainland China, however, whose voices remain unheard.
Yet
in a recent white paper
published by the Chinese government, Beijing boldly asserted what it believes
are advances in respecting its citizens’ fundamental rights.
The Chinese Communist Party claims that the “aspiration and the mission of the Party is to seek happiness for the people of China” and that putting the people at the “center of all its work is the supreme pursuit of the Party.” 
Its
second claim is far bolder: “Living a happy life is the primary human right.”
This
mission, while it might sound nice, is wholly unrepresentative of the reality
facing the Chinese people.
The Chinese government and, more specifically, the Chinese Communist Party assert that the Chinese government has the authority to define what human rights the Chinese people possess. The converse of that means that it’s at the sole discretion of the Chinese government to revoke those same rights.
Those rights enumerated by the Communist Party, unsurprisingly, conform to the party’s ends, even if that violates an individual’s right to freedom of religion, freedom of expression, or any other seminal liberty. It makes sense then that, contrary to the Chinese government’s claims, the Chinese people enjoy a fraction of the rights enjoyed in the free world. 
Those who dare to hold religious beliefs, for example, are subject to severe persecution. At least 1 million Uighurs—a Chinese ethnic-Muslim minority—have been sent to “political re-education camps” to erase their identity and assimilate them into the Han majority for the purposes of conforming their religious beliefs to the party’s beliefs.
Documents
leaked from the Chinese government detailing this program of extralegal
detainment serve as merely the latest example of how the Chinese government
exercises authoritarian control over its people. 
Further,
it exposes China’s thinly veiled bid to completely annihilate religion in China
through its campaign for the “Sinicization of religion.”
People
of faith are severely persecuted through imprisonment,
torture, forced
medical regimens, organ
harvesting, and arbitrary
executions.
For
a country that claims to be a stellar example of human rights, China’s
egregious violations of the most fundamental human rights standards contrast
starkly with its propaganda.
The
average citizen in China likely won’t be able to read this article, because it’s
censored.
Nor
can they read factual reporting on the Hong Kong protests. Chinese citizens are
fed propaganda that the protesters are terrorists,
paid by Western
countries to riot
and create disorder, and are lying
about their injuries.
Nor can they read about the ethnocide of Uighurs. Rather, they are told a myth by the government of “vocational training schools” where a backward people are helped to become civilized and shake off Islam as a foreign influence. 
A battle over values is being waged in Asia, and China is at the forefront. As China asserts a concerning vision for human rights, the U.S. should be ready to counter with arguments that favor liberty, freedom, and fundamental human rights.

"Tashpolat Tiyip was sentenced to death because the Chinese government suspected he was a separatist. Pictured: A complex in China's Xinjiang region believed to be a re-education camp where mostly Muslim ethnic minorities are detained. (Photo: Greg Baker/AFP via Getty Images)

Tashpolat Tiyip, a distinguished Uighur scholar of
geography, may face imminent death unless the U.S. government jumps in.
Vanished in 2017 after he was detained on his way to a conference in Germany, Tiyip was reportedly given a secret trial and sentenced in September 2017 to a suspended death sentence, along with five other members of the Xinjiang Education Supervision Bureau. 
The two-year mark of his suspended death sentence came and went in September and, thankfully, it is believed he has not yet been executed. But his execution could happen any day now. 
Given the severity of
the ongoing crisis in Xinjiang—an estimated 1 million or more minority Muslim
Uighurs are held by the Chinese government in political re-education facilities
today—the U.S. has a responsibility to act.  
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has called consistently for the release of all those arbitrarily detained in Xinjiang, should press now, along with others in the administration, for the release of Tiyip and all those detained in Xinjiang.
Tiyip was a professor in the geography department at Xinjiang University and in 2010 became president of the school. As was required, he was a member of the Chinese Communist Party. 
Before his apprehension, Tiyip was respected as a model of how Uighurs could succeed within the Chinese system and even acknowledged by Chinese state media as a “model minority leader.” 
How did the “model
minority leader” fall from grace?
According to reports, Tiyip was sentenced to death because the Chinese government suspected he was a separatist. 
The promotion of separatism is a non-starter in China, whose government prizes sovereignty as one of its primary foreign and domestic policy priorities (the other being the continued rule of the Chinese Communist Party). 
Those who knew Tiyip say accusations of separatism are false. It’s more likely that Tiyip’s high-profile academic status and myriad travels abroad made him a prime target in the midst of the Chinese government’s broader crackdown on Uighurs. 
The exact details of how and why he was apprehended are largely unknown given that the trial was secret.
Tiyip’s targeting comports with a broader trend. Some of the first targets of China’s efforts to collectivize and arbitrarily detain Uighurs in Xinjiang were Uighur students studying abroad, Uighurs living abroad, or Uighurs with family living abroad. 
Many were lured back to Xinjiang—with threats levied against their families if they did not return—only to be arbitrarily detained in the estimated 143 camps where there are reports of torture, self-criticism sessions, and even limited reports of death in the camps. 
Former detainees confirm these abuses and others. There are even reports of forced sterilization of Uighur women to control Uighur population growth. 
Tiyip’s situation, and
the situation of the million or more Uighurs currently held in detention,
merits action. 
A Heritage Foundation report outlines next steps the U.S.
government should take to respond to the crisis in Xinjiang. In addition to
calling for the release of all those arbitrarily detained, the report recommends
sanctioning known Chinese individuals and entities responsible for violating
human rights in Xinjiang under Treasury’s Global Magnitsky Act authorities,
among other solutions. 
The Trump administration has taken incremental steps in the right direction to respond to human rights violations in Xinjiang. It has restricted visas on Chinese officials responsible for the crisis in Xinjiang. Yet more can be done.  
Given the scale and scope of the crisis, the U.S. must consider financial sanctions against Chinese officials and call upon the Chinese government to do the right thing by releasing all those arbitrarily detained in Xinjiang. 
The U.S. government can build momentum for such action by raising the profile of Tiyip’s case before it is too late.

Wang Yi, a
renowned Christian pastor in China, was quietly sentenced on Monday to nine years in prison,
stripped of his political rights for three years, and fined 50,000 yuan. 
His sentence is harsh and symptomatic of a broader crackdown in China on Christians and people of all faiths.
Wang was taken into custody just before Christmas last year as the Chinese Communist Party began a new crackdown on religion. His arrest came on the heels of the government shutting down three large, unregistered churches, including Wang’s congregation, Early Rain Covenant Church in Chengdu. 
Wang was
taken into custody along with his wife and more than 100 of Early Rain’s congregants.
Except for Wang, all others were eventually released. 
Now, a
little more than a year in custody, Wang has been charged by the Chengdu Intermediate
People’s Court with “illegal business operations” and “inciting subversion of state
power.” The latter is a charge frequently brought in order to silence perceived
political opponents in China. 
Such politically
motivated charges are especially pernicious because they often come with the deprivation of political rights, meaning
the prisoner cannot
vote or be elected, or exercise the freedoms of speech, assembly, and press,
among other restrictions.
Knowing the character of the Chinese regime, Wang wrote a letter last year titled “My Declaration of Faithful Disobedience” and gave it to his congregation to publish were he ever to be imprisoned. 
The letter is both a defense of his faith and his actions, and is summarized in this excerpt:
The Bible teaches us that, in all matters relating to the gospel and human conscience, we must obey God and not men. For this reason, spiritual disobedience and bodily suffering are both ways we testify to another eternal world and to another glorious King.
This is why I am not interested in changing any political or legal institutions in China. I’m not even interested in the question of when the Communist regime’s policies persecuting the church will change. Regardless of which regime I live under now or in the future, as long as the secular government continues to persecute the church, violating human consciences that belong to God alone, I will continue my faithful disobedience. For the entire commission God has given me is to let more Chinese people know through my actions that the hope of humanity and society is only in the redemption of Christ, in the supernatural, gracious sovereignty of God.
According to Bob Fu, founder of ChinaAid, an organization that assists the persecuted church in China, “Pastor Wang’s nine-year sentence represents the harshest persecution of an ethnic Chinese house church pastor in more than a decade. … [T]he Chinese Communist Party is trying to send a chilling signal to the already-persecuted Christian community in China that unless you’re silent on the face of the evil regime, you are going to be put in jail.”
Early in
2018, China’s President Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party put in place
new regulations on religious activity in an effort to “Sinicize” or secularize
religion to conform to the Chinese Communist Party’s precepts. These
regulations and the principle of Sinicization have amplified China’s already-severe
persecution of religious groups. 
For Christians, churches in China have been shuttered and pastors and congregants imprisoned—some even killed, like Li Baiguang. For Catholics, the Vatican has capitulated to Beijing’s demands to share control over the appointment of bishops in China. For Muslims, more than 1 million Uighurs have been arbitrarily detained in political reeducation facilities, and other Muslims are facing increasing persecution. 
For
Buddhists, Tibetans continue to face restrictions on religious
practice and the use of the Tibetan language. For Falun Gong, members of the
group face various forms of persecution, and some have even allegedly had their
organs harvested. 
People of
all faiths are enduring persecution at the hands of the Chinese Communist Party,
which seeks to eliminate the political threat it sees from religious practice.
China’s severe threats to religious freedom merit a response. The U.S. government should consider ways that it can strengthen its response to threats to religious freedom around the globe. 
As
advocated in a recent Heritage Foundation paper, the U.S. should make ample use of
its human rights-based sanctions authority to hold government officials accountable
for violating religious freedom. The U.S. government should also continue to
shine a spotlight on China at the annual Ministerial to Advance Religious
Freedom. 
These and other steps should make up part of the response to Wang’s unjust sentencing, and the broader religious freedom violations taking place in China.

"The outside world can do little to assure the future of freedom in Hong Kong beyond making the case that preserving the principles of liberty are at stake. Nevertheless, the plight of that territory’s more than 7 million souls can teach us an important lesson about what China has in mind for the rest of the world. It is not good.
For starters, the continuing protests speak volumes about China’s commitment to “one country, two systems.” When the British transferred sovereignty over Hong Kong to China in 1997, Beijing agreed to this arrangement. It guaranteed that Hong Kong would be allowed to maintain its own governance and economic system.
The Hong Kong system—one of great economic freedom—has produced tremendous economic success. But economic freedom is no more popular than political freedom among the Chinese Communist Party. And in recent years, Chinese authorities have been encroaching on the rights supposedly guaranteed to Hong Kongers under the “one country, two systems” agreement.
Matters came to a head this April, when the Hong Kong government, under heavy pressure from Beijing, introduced legislation that would allow people accused of crimes against mainland China to be extradited. The proposal set off alarms among residents who know well that the mainland’s thoroughly politicized legal system is not to be trusted.
Fear that Beijing would quickly weaponize the proposed law to target democracy activists and journalists sparked massive protests. Efforts to suppress the demonstrations have only ignited more public demonstrations.
The protests also tell us a lot about mainland China. There is one strain of thought that Beijing, while quite happy to bully Hong Kong, would not be so rash as to put down the protests with harsh military action. That kind of response repulsed the world when the Soviets did it, ultimately leading to the break-up of the USSR.
Yet many observers fear that Beijing will step in and crack down on the demonstrators. After all, they note, the USSR’s demise didn’t stop the People’s Army from rolling tanks into Tiananmen Square.
There is no question that Beijing is waging a war on nerves. Last month, it assembled troops and equipment along the border with Hong Kong. It’s also begun airing footage of troops training for suppressing riots in urban settings.
This all speaks volumes about the callous cynicism with which the Chinese government treats its own people. The Hong Kong police are already doing Beijing’s dirty work for them (helped, to be fair, by protesters and agitators who have crossed the line and become violent or destructive).
As long as “pro-democracy” demonstrations don’t spread to the mainland cities, Beijing might not be too concerned to see Hong Kong’s stature as a stable and dependable place to do business diminished. Hong Kong just doesn’t mean near as much to the Chinese economy as it did 20 years ago. 
Besides, the Chinese would rather see investment flow to mainland cities like Guangzhou and Shanghai that are more firmly under the regime’s control. As for the welfare and future of the people of Hong Kong, that is the last thing Beijing cares about.
Most mainland Chinese seem indifferent about the protests. Many are jealous of the privileges long enjoyed by the people of Hong Kong. Rather than press for similar freedoms, they are happy to see the islanders brought down a notch. 
This is yet more evidence that the hope that opening up China to the world would encourage Beijing to integrate smoothly into an equitable and liberal rules-based order is little more than magical thinking.
Finally, there are lessons for the rest of us. China’s encroachment on Hong Kong represents yet another in a long string of promises broken by the communist regime. 
It has violated its commitments to U.N. Convention on the Law Seas, violated U.N. sanctions (which it voted for) against North Korea, and delivered debt and corruption (rather than the promised prosperity) through its vaunted Belt and Road economic “initiative.”
In sum, Beijing has a well-deserved rep for playing fast and loose with the rules as it tries to bully its way to the top—and its actions with Hong Kong only reinforce that reputation.
Nothing reflects the contemptuous attitude of the Chinese more than their prosperous propaganda claim that the Hong Kong demonstrations were engineered by the CIA. 
They know no right-thinking person in the world would believe this, but they don’t care. They know that the people of China will accept this explanation (after all, they’ll hear no other), and that’s all they want. 
China is acting like a global bully. Like most bullies, it will continue to do so—until the world stops tolerating Beijing’s intolerable behavior.
Hong Kong is a warning to the world. The world ought to take notice.

"Anti-extradition protesters gather at Kwai Fong MTR station in Hong Kong on Aug. 20. (Photo: Lillian Suwanrumpha/AFP/Getty Images)
Pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong continue as China flexes its muscles and warns of an intervention. Today, we feature an exclusive interview with Alvin Yeung, a politician from Hong Kong who supports the protests and hopes to achieve reforms. Read the interview, posted below, or listen on the podcast:

Daniel Davis: We’re joined now over the phone by Alvin Yeung. He is an elected representative from Hong Kong where he leads the pro-democracy Civic Party and is a member of the Legislative Council. 
Mr. Yeung, thanks so much for your time today.
Alvin Yeung:  Hello. Thank you for having me.
Davis: We’ve been following the recent protests in Hong Kong as they’ve developed, but I wanted to take a step back first and get some context. 
You’re an elected member of Hong Kong’s legislative body, where the extradition bill was originally proposed and then tabled. Can you explain for us why that bill was able to be proposed if it turned out to be so unpopular?
Yeung: Audience from America have to understand the fact that the Hong Kong legislature is not entirely democratic as it sounds. 
Half of the legislature was returned by geographical “one person, one vote” system, and that’s where I come from. But the other half of it comes from something called functional constituencies and they are representatives from different industries like the banking, legal, medical, etc. And some of them have corporate votes. 
Not everybody working in a bank gets a vote to vote for their banking representative, but only those bankers or the people who actually own a bank get to vote. 
So there’s this inequality in the system, and when the government enjoys a majority because of that system, they would count the votes and they think they could just go ahead on anything controversial.
Kate Trinko: Of course we’ve all been following these massive protests, and is the main thing at seat the extradition bill? Or are there other issues, other demands, from the protesters of things they want to see changed?
Yeung: At the beginning, people in Hong Kong took to the street to protest against this highly controversial extradition bill, but shortly after we understand that it goes way beyond the bill, it’s the system itself. 
The system cannot reflect what people really want. When the chief executive is not being elected by the people, when half of the legislature is not being elected by the people, then we demand democracy. We demand the fact that we have a right to directly elect, and choose, the chief executive and the full legislature.
Trinko: And are there any other demands that the protesters are looking to get?
Yeung: We are demanding the government to stop prosecuting people who participated in all these protests over the past two and a half months. We’re also demanding the government to withdraw their labeling of this protest as rioting. This is just plainly wrong.
Davis: Is there a path toward that kind of reform you’re looking for? What’s the strategy going forward?
Yeung: Right now the ball is in the court of the Hong Kong government and Beijing. If they really treasure Hong Kong, especially this very special city, then they have to understand that what Hong Kong people are demanding is not something so unreasonable. 
We are not asking for the moon. We are simply asking for something that was promised by Beijing, as stated clearly in the Basic Law, Basic Law is our mini constitution.
Trinko: How does your party, and other politicians in your party, feel about the protests right now?
Yeung: We understand that Hong Kong people are so united, we stand in solidarity. Over the past weekend or two, we saw Hong Kong immigrants protesting around the world in support of Hong Kong people. We understand that the world is watching and we are also asking the world, the international community, to continue paying attention in support of Hong Kong people’s peaceful demonstrations.
Davis: We’ve seen reports that the Chinese military is doing drills in Shenzhen, right across from Hong Kong. How would you, and your political allies, respond if China decided to intervene?
Yeung: We do have a fear that the army, or the armed police, would be deployed to Hong Kong. But again, this is why we are asking the international community to continue paying attention to Hong Kong. 
Never forget Hong Kong is not an ordinary city of China. We are not in isolation. Hong Kong is an international financial city. … The United States has huge amounts, billions of dollars, of investments and 85,000 United States nationals working or living in Hong Kong. So that would not only affect and harm Hong Kong, that will also harm the rest of the world who has a stake in Hong Kong. 
I just hope that Beijing would have the wisdom not to deploy troops in Hong Kong, because that will end “one country, two systems.”
Trinko: There’s been concerns, particularly with this action from China, that this could end up being another Tiananmen Square. Do you think that that analogy makes sense or do you reject it?
Yeung: Again, I do share that fear that Hong Kong will become another Tiananmen Square, but then again, I have to repeat this, we are now in 2019, it’s not 1989. 
Hong Kong is not another Tiananmen for the simple fact that we are an open society, the world is watching, we are well-connected to the rest of the world. Anything that happens in Hong Kong would be seen in everyone’s TV screen or phone screen within seconds. So if Beijing dares to really risk the special status of Hong Kong, then it would be extremely wrong to them.
Davis: And of course so much of this … comes in the context of the 50-year window between the handover in 1997 and 2047, when Hong Kong is scheduled to return fully to the Chinese system. 
How do you, and your political allies, look toward the future looking at that 2047 deadline? Would you like to see it delayed or some alternative future?
Yeung: We are working very hard to lay foundations for the future negotiation with Beijing if that ever happens. That we wish to see Hong Kong stays unique, we wish to see Hong Kong stay as a member of liberal democracy. That the values that we share with the rest of the world, at least the Western world, that freedom of speech can be upheld, that we can still have free elections. Although these are the things that we are facing challenges with. 
Right now Hong Kong is under challenge on all different fronts, but then we are urging the rest of the world to pay attention to Hong Kong, so that we can continue to enjoy the freedoms that we were supposed to have.
Trinko: Have you been able to participate in any of these protests yourself?
Yeung: Yes, I have been joining different protests, or standing at the forefront. Not all of them, but most of them.
Trinko: What is the experience like? What are people saying? How long are they out there? I think it’s just extraordinary. I believe one of them had 1 out of every 7 people in Hong Kong there. Those numbers are just unheard of. What is it like on the ground when you’re there?
Yeung: Yeah. I have to tell our audience here that Hong Kong has around 7 million people of population, but in early June we had 1 million people take to the street in opposition to the bill. And one week later, we had 2 million people take to the streets. And over the past two and a half months, we have all different kinds of protests or demonstrations against police brutality, against the fact that this government is not listening. 
Most recently, in the last weekend, we had 1.7 million people take to the streets in a peaceful manner, under the rain, to tell the rest of the world—and of course the Hong Kong and Beijing government—that all we are asking for is, No. 1, democracy, and No.2,  a formal withdrawal of the bill and investigation of police misconduct.
Davis: We’ve seen so many of those powerful images and even videos of protesters recently waving American flags and singing “The Star-Spangled Banner.” What role should the United States be playing in this, if at all?
Yeung: I’m here in the United States right now while we are talking to have a Hong Kong-U.S. dialogue with a U.S. congressman and senator. And we are telling our friends here to continue paying attention to Hong Kong, as Hong Kong is not standing in isolation. 
We are at a forefront of two different ideas, that is the liberal democracies ideas, and we are facing one of the biggest authoritarian states on Earth. So Hong Kong cannot stay alone. We need support, at least moral support, or any kind of support, from the rest of the world so that we understand we are not fighting this fight just on our own.
Trinko: Is there anything else that we didn’t ask you about that you think Americans should know?
Yeung: I appreciate the attention, and care, and support paid by Americans over the past two and a half months. I just wish that that could continue because we need support from the rest of the world, especially those from the United States of America.
Davis: All right. Alvin Yeung, thank you so much for your time today.
Yeung: Thank you very much.

"Pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong are intensifying, with the city’s main airport getting shut down. The big question: Will Beijing get involved? In today’s episode, we discuss that and more with Mike Gonzalez, a senior fellow at The Heritage Foundation. Plus: Miley Cyrus is getting a divorce, and her rationale doesn’t reflect too well on her—or her generation. We discuss.

"It was not a happy Thanksgiving for President Donald Trump’s detractors, as the president showed with his surprise trip Thursday to Afghanistan that “America First” is not a code term for isolationism.
Trump’s visit with U.S. troops, his meeting with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, and his announcement that the U.S. has reopened peace talks with the Taliban showed that America is in anything but retreat.
By now, it should be clear to everyone that accusations claiming Trump is really an isolationist are bogus.
Most recently, when Trump announced a shift in Syria policy, he was accused of “abandoning the Middle East.” Over time, the facts on the ground didn’t bear that out.
Now we know that the U.S. brokered a cease-fire between Syrian and Kurdish forces that undoubtedly helped avoid needless bloodshed. America continues to fight the Islamic State terrorist group and work with the Kurds, and no adversary has realized any real gains from the shift in the U.S. footprint.
Still think the isolationist label sticks to Trump? How does that square with his action in signing legislation supporting the people of Hong Kong in their struggle with China?
Now the U.S. is on record to support the effort of Hong Kongers to retain the political and economic freedoms that Beijing promised to honor when Britain returned Hong Kong to Chinese control.
Trump faced tremendous pressure from Beijing to veto that legislation. He didn’t. That doesn’t jibe with the notion that the president wants to turn his back on the free world.
Trump’s trip to Afghanistan was yet another reminder that he is willing to go to the ends of the Earth to protect America’s interests. Keeping the Taliban from overrunning Afghanistan is key to peace and stability in South Asia, and to blocking a resurgence of the likes of al-Qaeda.
Trump differs from his predecessors in that he seeks neither to solve all the world’s problems nor to ignore legitimate threats to U.S. interests. What he is trying to do is establish a credible and sustainable global footprint that makes clear to adversaries that the U.S. is no pushover and it doesn’t intend to become one.
To that end, Trump has pushed friends and allies to bear their fair share of the peace-and-stability load. He has pushed U.S. forces forward not to fight endless wars or act as the world’s policeman, but to safeguard our interests and partner with those who share our vision for a peaceful, prosperous global space.
Afghanistan is a case in point for what can be called the Trump Doctrine. Trump shifted the mission of U.S. forces there from fighting a war to providing advice and support for the Afghan people. He made a commitment to stick it out. And he offered the Taliban an off-ramp from the conflict.
If the Taliban are willing to talk peace with the Afghan government, then the U.S. is willing to talk, too—but all the while, America will continue to provide military support for the Afghan government and conduct counterterrorism operations.
Trump has made similar offers to all of America’s competitors: Iran, Russia, China, and North Korea.
The president’s trip to Afghanistan demonstrates his continued resolve to follow through. No doubt, Trump was also pleased to spend time with the troops he loves—and to let them know how thankful he and the entire country are for their service and sacrifice.
The Trump Doctrine—and any responsible foreign policy—cannot succeed without our courageous men and women in uniform. The president clearly appreciates their patriotism and all they do for our country.

"What a difference a decade makes.
In 2010, we got the Arab Spring and Obamacare. Neither turned out as well as we had hoped.
We got iPads, iPhone 4, and Angry Birds. Tech has definitely moved on.
What about America’s foreign policy? It had its ups and downs. Here is a list of the top 10 foreign policy hits and misses of the decade.
1. Hit. Sticking It Out in Afghanistan (2010) 
After coming into office, one of President Barack Obama’s first big foreign policy challenges was to decide what to do about the war in Afghanistan. In 2010, he surged U.S. forces, turning around a rapidly deteriorating situation. Equally important, he started a transition from an American-led effort to building an Afghan military that could take up the responsibility for defending the Afghan people. 
President Donald Trump has followed through, and after this next drawdown, U.S. force levels in Afghanistan will be about what they were when Obama left office.
Overall, the U.S. effort in Afghanistan has served American interests well. The region is far more stable now. The Taliban are not winning, and the Afghan government seems in no danger of collapse. The likes of al-Qaeda and ISIS no longer can use it as a sanctuary or a platform for global terrorism. As long as this condition prevails, we win.
2. Miss. Pulling Out of Iraq (2011) 
You could make a case that invading Iraq was the wrong move. And there’s an even stronger case to be made that the subsequent occupation—poorly planned and sloppily executed—was even worse. Yet the situation Obama inherited there in 2008 was at least manageable. Unfortunately, he made it worse.
He made no serious effort to get a status of forces agreement to keep U.S. troops in the country. Instead, he rapidly withdrew American forces and influence in 2011, triggering a free-for-all that ended in political fragmentation, the rise of ISIS, the near-collapse of the Iraqi military, and a surge of Iranian meddling. We are still coping with the aftermath.
3. Hit. Killing Bin Laden (2011) 
Obama deserves full credit for taking out the mastermind of the 9/11 terrorist attacks and effectively capping the war on global terrorism. No, the threat of global Islamist terrorism isn’t eradicated completely. But the U.S. has continued to deal with that threat effectively throughout the decade.
4. Miss. Bungling Benghazi (2012) 
After abandoning his famous “red line” in Syria, Obama planned to save face with a lead-from-behind campaign to liberate Libya. So enamored with his light-touch foreign policy, his administration refused to acknowledge, let alone address, a spiraling security situation that resulted in the tragic and needless death of Americans, including the U.S. ambassador. The debacle seemed to make the Obama administration even more risk-averse when it came to standing up for America’s interests around the world.
5. Miss. Iran Deal (2013) 
Obama brokered the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, claiming it would solve the problem of Iran as a nuclear threat and instigator-in-chief of Middle Eastern instability. It didn’t. 
Armed with boatloads of cash and the chaos wrought by ISIS in Syria and Iraq, Iran mobilized its surrogates—Hamas, Islamic Jihad, the Houthi rebels in Yemen, Hezbollah, and the Shia militias in Iraq. As a result, the entire region was far worse off when Obama left office than when he was sworn in. And the problems weren’t just in the Middle East. A rising China, a restive Russia, and a belligerent North Korea were also threatening vital U.S. interests—and they continue to do so today.
6. Miss. Playing Pals With Putin (2018) 
In 2016, it was hard to make sense of Trump’s “America First” pledge. It may have worked as a campaign slogan, but it told us nothing about his foreign policy. In 2017, he published a sound national security strategy addressing all the big problems, yet folks debated whether the president supported his own foreign policy blueprint.
He did himself no favors with his first NATO meeting and a subsequent press conference with Russian strongman Vladimir Putin. Afterward, the administration spent weeks reassuring people that the U.S. wasn’t leaving NATO, lifting sanctions on Russia, or selling out Ukraine. 
Folks had a hard time distinguishing between “Showman Trump,” who made all kinds of outrageous public comments for all kinds of reasons, and “Serious Trump,” who delivered sound decisions and policies in America’s interests.
7. Hit. Crushing the Caliphate (2018) 
Trump showed there was a serious leader behind the showman when he doubled down on defeating ISIS as decisively and quickly as possible. So long, risk-averse foreign policy; hello, self-assured, decisive action. The U.S. continues to press a global campaign against Islamist terror threats, most notably by hunting down Baghdadi, the head of the crushed caliphate, and bin Laden’s son.
8. Hit. Withdrawing From INF (2019) 
By pulling out of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, Trump served notice that the U.S. was now committed to facing the world’s problems rather than turning a blind eye to them. The Obama administration had tried to ignore Putin’s cheating; Trump just pulled the plug.
It wasn’t the only stiff-arm the U.S. gave Russia. Trump gave arms to Ukraine, increased military support to Europe, kept up the sanctions on Moscow, and backed NATO enlargement. He did exactly everything Putin hated.
That tough love approach carried over elsewhere—from Iran to North Korea (“maximum pressure”) to Beijing (trade war and more). His basic message was simple: America is a pushover no more. After three years, it was clear Trump had a solid plan for dealing with problems around the world.
9. Miss. Explaining Syria (2019) 
While Trump’s policies had more hits than misses, not so his rhetorical talents. His explanation of the U.S. response to Turkey’s incursion in Syria created chaos. While the predictions of disaster were proved wrong, much of the outrage and anxiety could have been avoided by responsible explaining.
10. Hit. NATO’s London Meeting (2019) 
You know that Trump rocked it at the NATO meeting because the best his detractors could muster was “small ball” carping. In contrast, his accomplishments were real: promoting increased investment in NATO, focusing attention on the China threat, and emphasizing the strategic importance of space. 
Trump has pressed our allies to do more, even as he has led the U.S. to strengthen our own military and increase military sales to allied and friendly nations—in every key theater.
Adding up the plus and minuses, it is hard to argue the U.S. isn’t better off than when the decade began. While Trump doesn’t earn Obama’s style points, he has done more to keep America free, safe, and prosperous—and it doesn’t look like impeachment is slowing him down.

"It’s fine for astrologers and bookmakers to make predictions, but there’s no absolute certainty about what the future holds. That’s true regarding matters of national security—and there the stakes are truly high.
Consider Iran. There is no more risky business than predicting when an authoritarian regime will collapse under the weight of its own putrefaction. Natan Sharansky has an excellent explanation of this phenomenon in his book “The Case for Democracy” (2004).
By their nature, he notes, these regimes are opaque. Their leaders hide the truth from the outside world, their own people—even from each other. 
At the same time, they control every element of governance, civil society, the economy, the military, and the media. This makes it really hard to see the cracks that eventually lead to failure and collapse.
Moreover, there are no relief mechanisms that allow for accommodation, dissent, and change. When under assault from without and within, these regimes can roil with a furious boil until the pressure cooker explodes—a catastrophic failure that takes many by surprise.
How close the Tehran regime is to condition red is anybody’s guess. Today it faces the authoritarian’s worst nightmare: intense pressure from the outside and the inside.
Thuggish regimes excel at handling one or the other. When pressed from without, they rally the people and even use the external threat as a pretext for clamping down on dissent even more harshly. When threatened from within, they ruthlessly suppress opposition voices. 
But when these regimes are hammered from both directions simultaneously, they struggle.
Today, Tehran is being jackhammered—and not just by the Trump administration. The foreign ministries of Germany, the United Kingdom, and France have joined in calling out the regime for non-compliance with the Iran nuclear deal and denouncing the regime’s actions as unacceptable. 
Iran is on its way to more crippling “snap-back” sanctions.
Meanwhile, inside Iran, the natives are more than restless. Perhaps the most stunning clue of how times have changed from the revolution of 1979 is the stunning video of Iranian students streaming down the street, deliberately refusing to walk over images of the American and Israeli flags on the sidewalk. 
Who would have thought we would have seen such a thing in our lifetimes? It may not be quite as startling as taking a sledgehammer to the Berlin Wall, but it is nonetheless stunning.
The protesters aren’t the only challenges the regime faces. Iran’s economy is bottoming out. Its surrogate military forces—bringing death and instability from Syria to Yemen, Iraq, and more—are now under assault themselves throughout the greater Middle East. And its supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, is no spring chicken. 
No one expects the octogenarian ayatollah to hang on that much longer—and the smart money says a leadership struggle will follow his passing.
But this is not to say that freedom is just around the corner in Iran.
This is a tough bunch of mullahs. They have sustained the revolution for nearly a half-century and show no signs of letting up or losing control. They have doubled down on suppressing internal dissent and are as recalcitrant as ever in their stand-off with President Donald Trump.
Odds are the government won’t just collapse, nor will Iran turn overnight into a “normal” nation like Norway, as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pines for. 
The most likely scenario is the regime turns a little risk-averse, metering its foreign adventurism so it can focus on stabilizing its internal security. That is what the regime has done in the past when the revolution felt squeezed.
Still, there is no telling what steps or missteps Iran may take—and the U.S. shouldn’t try to guess. The consequences of guessing wrong could be really bad.
The best course now is for Trump to stick to his current strategy, for the simple reason that it is the one best calculated to safeguard U.S. interests. 
The U.S. should not press for regime change. For one, it’s not clear that’s an achievable goal. For another, it is far from clear what would come after. There would likely be a whole new set of challenges.
If the Iranian people opt for regime change (and who could blame them?), that’s their business. The people of Iran have a perfect right to cry “freedom.” If they throw the mullahs out, we and the rest of the world will just have to deal with the aftermath.
If the regime hangs on, the mullahs will have to learn to live with being a pariah state, or they will have to take the bold choice of taking Pompeo’s advice and joining the family of responsible nations.

"“Thank you for your service.” Our troops hear that often from their fellow Americans, and not just during the holidays. Well, our gratitude can go even deeper. We also can be thankful that our military isn’t fighting “endless wars.”
Calls for “no more endless wars” may be catchy, but they’re a bumper-stick excuse for a serious foreign policy. 
Sure, there are many intractable conflicts around the world. But that’s not what defines America’s military deployments. And if President Donald Trump’s critics could look at the facts on the ground, free from political bias, they would see that his administration has done an excellent job aligning America’s global footprint with U.S. national interests.
The White House has drawn the most criticism for its operations in Syria, which without question will remain a fractured country plagued with instability and conflict for years to come. 
This, simply put, is not our war. That didn’t stop critics from assailing the president. Nor did they retract their criticism when it became clear that while we aren’t planning on being a party to the conflict, we aren’t walking away from our responsibility, either.
The U.S. is adjusting its presence to continue the fight against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, and positively contribute to minimizing conflict that affects friends and allies. What the president is doing throughout the Middle East is transitioning to a more sustainable posture, one that equitably shares the burdens while keeping the pressure on ISIS and Iran, the chief destabilizing threats in the region.
In a similar manner, the U.S. is still in Afghanistan. But we aren’t fighting a war. We are, along with our NATO allies, providing advice and support to the Afghan people, who are defending themselves.
Afghans don’t want to live under the oppression of the Taliban. Supporting them is not only a noble mission, it serves U.S interests. If the Taliban overran Afghanistan again, we would be right back to the dangerous conditions we faced on 9/11.
In Western Europe, this administration actually has increased America’s military might—not to fight a war, but to deter a future one. And it’s hard to argue with success. Under Trump’s watch, not one more inch of European soil has fallen into Russian President Vladimir Putin’s grasp. That’s a record that can’t be matched by the past two presidents.
In Asia, China is undergoing an unprecedented military expansion. No one outside Beijing thinks that’s going to make the world a safer place. There’s no question that the U.S., in concert with its allies, needs to step up and counter this expansion. 
That’s far from warmongering. Support for the effort is also truly bipartisan, recognizing America has to do more to ensure its future as an Indo-Pacific power.
In other places around the world, our troops are deployed in numbers large and small. They aren’t looking for a fight. They aren’t looking to own a square foot of soil. They are there because America is a global power with global responsibilities.
Our troops aren’t the world’s policemen, but they are looking after our interests around the world. They are part of America’s most important export, a force for peace and stability.
So as we remember our troops this holiday season—as they often experience about as much comfort as the exhausted, ragged Continental Army did when heading for its winter camp in Valley Forge—let’s remember exactly why we should be grateful.

"The case of Navy SEAL Chief Petty Officer Eddie Gallagher, which
ultimately resulted in the firing of Navy Secretary Richard Spencer, should
have been handled differently.  
The prosecution mishandled the case, President Donald Trump intervened prematurely, and the Navy secretary got caught between trying to do the right thing, an unorthodox president, and keeping the defense secretary in the loop. 
The case highlights a number of red flags, each of which we highlight below, and unless and until those issues are resolved, the fiasco that was the Gallagher case is likely to repeat itself. It didn’t have to end this way, and should be a lesson going forward.
Before getting into the specifics of the Gallagher case,
let’s start with the basics.
Under our constitutional framework, the president is the commander
in chief of the U.S. armed forces. Civilian control over the military is a
strength and distinguishing feature of our democratic republic. The secretary
of defense, a Cabinet-level officer appointed by the president, is the senior
Defense Department civilian in day-to-day charge of the military. Effective
defense secretaries maintain close ties to the president, especially during
times of war or ongoing military operations, like those we have today.  
As we have written
elsewhere, the military exists to defend the nation. To accomplish that
mission, leaders must ensure that those who serve under them are combat-ready,
and once ordered into armed conflict, combat-effective. Maintaining good order
and disci­pline in the armed forces is essential to accomplish­ing the mission.

The United States military justice system is integral to the
military’s mission. It is unique, and for good reason. Unlike the civilian
justice system, which exists solely to enforce the laws of the juris­diction
and punish wrongdoers, our military justice system exists in
order to help the military to succeed in its mission to defend the nation. 
It is structured so that those in charge, commanding
officers, can carry out the orders of their civilian leaders. Ultimately, it is
structured to fight and win wars. It does so in accordance with rules or laws
to which the U.S. has agreed, so as to minimize the extremes and horrific
abuses to which war can drive people as was experienced in the two world wars.
Throughout our nation’s history, there have been isolated instances
where U.S. service members have been accused of violating the laws of war. Fortunately,
those cases have been few and far between, as almost every soldier, sailor, airman,
and Marine carry out their duties honorably and follow the rules, even under
tremendously difficult circumstances.  
When breaches of discipline or law do happen, there is
usually an investigation. If investigated properly, and if there is evidence of
a potential crime, the service member (who is presumed innocent under the law)
may be sent to a court-martial (a criminal trial), but not until he is afforded
a free attorney and due process.
These cases are handled within the military justice system, and it is rare that they come to the attention of a president. In high-profile cases, the press may write stories about the case, and Congress may take an interest in it, but for the most part, the system of justice methodically proceeds step-by-step through the finest military justice system in the world, with all the procedural protections built into the system.  
When the commander in chief does become aware of high-profile
cases, it has been the practice and custom for presidents to let the process run
its course, as there is no guarantee how any case will turn out.  
Presidents in the past have weighed in to commute a sentence or pardon a service member, but they usually wait until after the case has run its course, for good reason. A president is not required to wait, but it is usually the prudent thing to do, as it sends the obvious message to all that process matters, that the commander in chief understands and appreciates the need to maintain good order and discipline in the armed forces, and that the system itself is to be trusted.  
That’s not to say that when past presidents have waited, and then acted, that those actions have been popular with the military—or the public, for that matter. President Barack Obama’s commutation of Pvt. Chelsea Manning’s sentence from 35 years to a mere seven years was highly controversial, and unwarranted, in our opinion. 
Manning was convicted and sentenced by a military judge for disclosing more than 800,000 classified documents to WikiLeaks, which in turn published that trove of documents, causing untold damage to our national security.
Obama claimed he commuted Manning’s sentence because it was disproportionate to the crimes committed, and when compared with other leakers’ sentences. As we have written, we disagreed with that rationale, as there was no other leaker nearly as profligate as Manning in American history.  
Given the vast amount of actual battlefield experience accumulated by many within our military, there is a keen understanding of the incredibly difficult choices fellow warriors have to make. They (1) are presumed to know the rules of engagement; (2) are presumed to have followed those rules, and (3) are given the benefit of the doubt when it is a close call. That is what we should expect from the profession of arms; namely, experienced warriors making prudent decisions based on all available information.
All of which brings us to Trump and the Gallagher case.
For starters, Navy SEALs are amazing warriors. They are highly intelligent, exquisitely trained, deeply experienced special operators. SEALs are routinely tasked with missions that are incredibly dangerous, fluid in nature, and require strength, intelligence, stamina, courage, patience, sagacity, and teamwork. Most Americans would be hard-pressed to fully understand the challenges and pressures faced daily by our Navy SEALs.  
But SEALs are human, and like the rest of us, they make mistakes. Most mistakes are minor, but some can be significant. And while it is understandable on one level that mistakes will happen, given the repeated combat tours and high-stress environment that SEALs work in, SEALs are not immune from the rules. When they violate them, they must be held to account.
In 2017, Gallagher, a decorated SEAL, was on his eighth combat tour in Afghanistan when he is alleged to have committed various crimes. He was charged with premeditated murder, aggravated assault, assault with a dangerous weapon, wrongful use and possession of controlled substances, obstructing justice, and wrongfully posing for a picture with the corpse of an ISIS fighter, along with some other minor charges for actions he allegedly took in Iraq in 2017. 
Finding sufficient cause to bring the case to trial, the
convening authority within Gallagher’s chain of command did so in 2018, an
entire year after the alleged crime. By then, the case had grown cold, and
critical evidence had not been preserved for the trial. 
To make matters worse, the original prosecutor in the case,
a Navy commander, was dismissed by the military judge for unethical behavior. A
junior prosecutor took over the case and called other SEALs as witnesses in the
case against Gallagher, including those who were at the scene of the death of
the ISIS fighter and, therefore, had firsthand knowledge of what took place.  
One of those witnesses was Special Warfare Operator 1st Class Corey Scott, to whom the prosecution gave immunity in exchange for his testimony against Gallagher. The immunity deal came back to bite the government, because at trial, Scott testified that, contrary to the allegation that Gallagher had stabbed the prisoner to death, Scott himself had blocked the prisoner’s breathing tube and killed him as an act of mercy.   
The military jury acquitted Gallagher of the murder charge, and all other charges, except for posing with a corpse, finding him guilty of the latter offense. They sentenced him to four months’ confinement, and reduced him in rank by one pay grade. Since Gallagher had already served 201 days in pretrial confinement, he was given credit for time served and was released from confinement. 
After his conviction, Gallagher was still in the Navy. The
SEAL leadership had to decide what to do with a sailor with a court-martial
conviction. In a normal case, Navy leaders would have sent the case to an
administrative discharge board, and that panel of three officers would decide
whether to fire the sailor from the Navy or let him continue to serve. But
given presidential, congressional, and media interest, this was no ordinary
case.
Senior Navy leaders decided that Gallagher should go before a Trident Review Board (a panel of SEALs) who would decide whether he should keep his Trident, the distinctive badge earned by SEALs. 
The question was whether Gallagher’s conduct was sufficiently bad as to bring discredit on the special operations community—the SEALs in particular—such that his expulsion from the SEALs (but not the Navy) was warranted. 
This would have been far from unprecedented. Trident Review
Boards have reviewed, and removed, Tridents from more than 150 SEALs in recent
years.
When the members of Gallagher’s savvy defense team learned that their client might lose his Trident pin, they worked the media, especially Fox News, to drum up support for their client.
An avid consumer of media reporting, especially Fox News, Trump
tweeted on Nov. 21, “The Navy will NOT be taking
away Warfighter and Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher’s Trident pin. This case was
handled very badly from the beginning. Get back to business!” That tweet,
coming from the commander in chief, was Trump’s unorthodox way of giving an
order to the Navy: Don’t send Gallagher to a Trident Review Board.  
Other presidents probably would have waited to see what the Trident Review Board did before acting. Trident Review Boards are composed of fellow SEALs, who sit in judgment of fellow SEALs, and decide whether or not to allow their shipmates to keep their Tridents, given the alleged misconduct.  
But Trump acted on instinct and put a halt to the board
before it could take place, depriving the SEALs of the opportunity to weigh in
on their shipmate’s conduct. Some see this as a character flaw in the president;
namely, a consistent habit of acting impulsively, even recklessly. Others see his
unorthodox and quick decisions as a welcome breath of fresh air, a president
who takes action rather than dither or be hostage to long, drawn-out,
bureaucratic processes.  
It is clear that Trump believed, like many Americans, that
Gallagher had gone through enough, that he had been exonerated of the worst
charges, that he had served his country bravely and with honor for many years,
and that further action against him needed to end.  
We believe in an orderly process, and that to maintain good
order and discipline, following the process was paramount and should have
happened.
Trump’s actions put Spencer, the Navy secretary, in a tough
spot. As a former Marine, he knew maintaining good order and discipline is key
to an effective fighting force and that process mattered. But he also knew that
the president wanted the Navy to halt the Trident Review Board (and quite
possibly an administrative discharge board if that followed). 
Spencer tried to satisfy everyone involved by crafting a deal with
the White House that would allow for Gallagher to retire from the SEALs if
Trump stayed out of the case.    
The problem was that Spencer had told senior defense officials, according to The Washington Post, that he was considering resigning if Trump forced the issue, implying that he would stand against the president’s directive in order to allow the process to move forward without interference. But this side deal could only be interpreted as Spencer trying to get the president what he wanted—an honorable exit for Gallagher—even if the review board concluded otherwise. 
It was, as others have called it, a
“sham review process with a preordained outcome.” Further, the side deal was
offered in secret, without the knowledge of the secretary of defense, something
Secretary Mark Esper could not let go unaddressed. When the defense secretary
found out about Spencer’s side deal, he got Trump’s permission to fire Spencer.   
When Obama commuted the sentence of Manning, it sent a loud
and clear message that leaking millions of classified documents to WikiLeaks
was not that serious, even though the publication of those documents has been
described by senior intelligence officials as the most damaging leak of
national security secrets in our nation’s history. 
At least Obama commuted the sentence the old-fashioned way: He
let the process play out until conviction, and then acted. He acted,
consequences be damned.
Gallagher is no Manning—far from it. Gallagher is not a war
criminal, as some have suggested, but he was convicted of posing with a corpse
after an investigation and flawed prosecution. The president had every right to
weigh in and let Gallagher keep his Trident, especially given the way the case
was handled from the beginning.  
But how the president handled this, and other recent
military cases, also warrants review and, in our opinion, criticism. It would
have been far better for the president to allow the judicial and review
processes to play out to make it clear that the military’s legal system is
inherently good and can be trusted, even when it bungles a case on rare
occasion. 
It would have also sent the message to the military that
every individual and his or her actions are subject to review, judging them
according to standards of behavior essential to good order and the values we
hold dear as Americans, but also accounting for the circumstances of war as
appropriate.  
When the few service members who violate the military’s Uniform Code of Military Justice are convicted by a jury of their peers, and their convictions are upheld on appeal, you’re not “sticking up for the military” by pardoning them. Such action can be interpreted as excusing criminal behavior, undermining the system, and eroding good order and discipline in the armed forces.  
Pardoning military members should be a sober, thoughtful,
and judicious act, one untainted by even the perception of political self-interest.  
The military justice system isn’t perfect, but it is very,
very good and has a lengthy history of dispensing true justice fairly and in
accordance with American values, legal protections, and the imperative of
having a military that is effective in war while disciplined in its conduct of
war.
This specific case was handled poorly from the beginning. But
this episode should act as a reminder that good order and discipline in the
armed forces can only be achieved when people follow the rules and procedures. 
If and when the commander in chief wants to exercise
executive leniency, it is best done after serious consultation with senior
military officials, and after the process has run its course, and only when
leniency is deserved.

"Jack Spencer

Jack Spencer oversees The Heritage Foundation's research on a range of domestic economic and trade issues as vice president for the think tank's Institute for Economic Freedom and Opportunity.
President Donald Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He on Wednesday signed Phase 1 of the U.S.-China Economic and Trade Agreement.
The long-awaited deal is the result of two years of tough trade negotiations between Washington and Beijing. 
Over this period, new taxes have
been placed on hundreds of billions of traded goods across the Pacific as the
U.S.-China trade war escalated. This led American importers to pay roughly $43
billion in new taxes, not to mention the cost to American farmers of losing market
access to China. 
Now, the new Phase 1 deal takes a significant step toward normalizing the U.S.-China trade relationship as it’s easily the most comprehensive agreement our countries have signed since China’s entry into the World Trade Organization.
American companies’ access to China’s
market, the protection of their intellectual property rights, and ability to do
business free from Chinese government coercion long has been a concern of the
Trump administration. 
The Phase 1 deal attempts to address these concerns by implementing procedures to protect American intellectual property and stopping the forced transfer of trade secrets to Chinese entities.
The agreement also opens up new
opportunities for U.S. farm and agriculture exporters by removing nontariff
barriers to China’s market.
The deal includes commitments by China to increase its purchases of U.S. agriculture, manufactured, and energy goods and services by $200 billion over two years. 
Although the agreement attempts to shift China’s political economy to a more market-based one, free from government intervention, there is nothing market-based about these government-directed purchases.
The Phase 1 deal, while not perfect, is a step in the right direction and we should welcome the swift conclusion of a Phase 2 deal and removal of all tariffs levied over the past two years. 
In December, the Trump administration announced it would hold off on new tariffs on roughly $160 billion worth of imports, and halve the tariff rate Feb. 14 on roughly $120 billion worth of imports from China as part of the Phase 1 agreement. 
But until a Phase 2 deal is concluded, Americans will continue to shoulder the cost of tariffs on up to $370 billion worth of imports from China.

"This article s adapted from a lecture James Carafano gave at The Heritage Foundation’s Dec. 9 event, “The Problem of Nationalism.”
I have two recommendations to address nationalism. One is called parsing and the other is called spade work.
This is not about arguing about bumper stickers, and the problem cannot be solved by discussing bumper stickers. When my Heritage Foundation colleague Jack Spencer says liberalism, he’s talking about Adam Smith. When Sen. Elizabeth Warren is talking about liberalism, she’s talking about the opposite from Adam Smith.
A really good illustrative example is “America First.”
America First was a fine bumper sticker. Right after Donald Trump used it for the first time in a campaign speech, I went to the guys in the corner. I said, “Hey guys.” I said, “You know where this comes from, right? Lindbergh, isolationism?” 
And the response was really interesting. They said, “Ninety-nine percent of the people that vote for us, they have no idea where it comes from. And the other thing is, it’s not what we mean.” 
That might be a fine argument for a campaign slogan, but it’s a completely inadequate basis for governance. So as much as America First helped get the Trump administration elected, it spent as much time explaining to American people and the world how what they mean by America First is not isolationism, that America may be fighting for self-interest, but it doesn’t mean America is selfish [because] we engage with friends and allies.
The bumper sticker can’t solve the fundamental, underlying policy debate that has to be had and has to be taken more serious than that, because when people say nationalism, I think Kim Holmes covered the waterfront well. 
For some people, it’s just about how do we engage conservative voters, or how do we energize the popular space? Other people, when they use that term, they have a much darker, insidious, and evil meaning for that and you cannot solve that debate by replacing that bumper sticker with a different bumper sticker. 
For the serious policy community that’s interested in governance and keeping America free, safe, and prosperous, we simply have to do better than that. So I have really divided this into two categories, the parsing and the spade work.
I think the parsing falls into two areas. One is we have to have the courage and seriousness and honesty to differentiate between tolerance and the polity. 
Tolerance is about our understanding of the right of free speech and the willingness that a person say any kind of wacky thing they really want to as long as nobody gets hurt or died. Tolerate that all you want. That’s very different from saying that person has a legitimate part in the national conversation, that that is a legitimate part of the polity, that that person deserves a seat at the table. 
If somebody wants to be a white nationalist or a racist or a fascist or a communist, that’s their business. But that doesn’t mean that they’re a legitimate part of this national conversation. Those are tough things that I think we have to do to make those distinctions.
The other kind of parsing I think is between sovereignty and popular sovereignty. We believe in a state system because it’s the best alternative to global anarchy. It’s not God-given. It’s not a natural right. It’s just a practical system of governance, which has worked over years, and actually serves America’s interests fairly well. 
So, we would broadly respect the sovereignty of other states, because they should broadly respect ours and we would only impinge on theirs when they impinged on our vital interests and we’re not surprised when they do likewise. 
That is very different from the concept of popular sovereignty, in which the United States should remain legitimately and importantly a global champion. The difference is between a nation where the people serve the state and a state that exists to serve the people. Those are two very different conversations and we have to be particular and careful to differentiate those two different discussions. Sovereignty and popular sovereignty, tolerance and the polity.
This gets to the second category, which I call spade work. We have to do our homework, both in the parsing and in the policy.
 In the parsing, I don’t think it’s legitimate to sit down at a table with communists and racists and white supremacists and have a discussion about what the future of America should be. 
Some say, “Well, having them at the table shows that you’re respecting free speech.” No, it doesn’t. It means I’m giving legitimacy to their ideas. I think we have to have the courage to recognize there are people that rightfully should be excluded from the national conversation about serious governance in the United States. I think that’s fair.
Now having said that, I don’t think it’s fair if somebody is excluded because somebody says, “Well, he’s a fascist,” or, “He’s a racist,” or, “He’s a white nationalist,” or, “He’s a communist,” because that’s just a tactic of exclusion. 
We’ve seen the Russians do this all the time. I mean, nobody’s more fascist than [Russian President] Vladimir Putin, and Putin’s No. 1 instrument is to run around and call everybody in Europe a fascist so they’re excluded from the conversation.
You can’t make those kind of difficult judgment calls between whether somebody that organized a riot to purposefully get people killed in Charlottesville should be part of your conversation from maybe a government in Western Europe that decides that they want to have a different judicial system or organize their elections differently. That’s something that’s not covered in a bumper sticker, and that requires all of us to do a bit of our homework.
There also needs to be spade work in policy. The Heritage Foundation recently published “True North: The Principles of Conservatism.” They’re not policy prescriptions, but they’re statements that really go back to the purpose of what we tried to achieve in the Constitution, which is how do we create a fair and equitable society that respects natural rights and human liberties and create a system that fosters that? 
The bumper sticker debate is never going to get those issues, never get to those serious questions, and so I think it’s impingement upon us to take the conversation beyond the bumper stickers and actually get to the particular policies. 
I don’t want to sit down and have a conversation with a white nationalist because I know already I don’t think they’re part of that conversation because they don’t believe in natural rights. They don’t believe in individual human freedoms.
On the other hand, you like Obamacare? I don’t know why, but we should sit down and have a conversation together about what is the best way to do this, and I think we have to be prepared for that conversation and these kind of ideas really get us to that next level that’ll enable us to do that. And I’ll just cite one: “International agreements and international organizations should not infringe on American’s constitutional rights, nor should they diminish American sovereignty.”
We shouldn’t do anything that undermines the sovereignty of the American people, or allows international, multinational organizations to impinge upon that. That’s not about being a nationalist. That’s being about preserving the freedoms of the American people.
For example, China has a particular policy of taking Chinese nationals and placing them in various U.N. organizations because their view is that those Chinese nationalists are, above all, subservient and report to and act on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party. 
Their purpose in those organizations is not to assist in the governance or the operation of the organizations. It’s to drive the policies that China wants, to create the norms and outcomes that China demands. 
We should oppose that, not because we’re nationalists. That is antithetical to American interests. That is a direct assault on our popular sovereignty, to create international norms and international institutions which are designed at the behest of a foreign power essentially to undermine our freedoms and liberties.
If we’re stuck in a debate about nationalism, then we have lost. If we’re not into the weeds of discussing actual policies and how they operationalize the protections of human freedom, then we have a great problem. 
Just to cite one example, I think what Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has done with the commission he’s organized on unalienable human rights, defining what are actual human liberties, human rights, that fundamentally should not be abridged and that should be foundational to understanding of our policy of what we do and shouldn’t do in the world.
That’s not just a reflection of our sovereignty. It’s a reflection of the nation of popular sovereignty and the foundational idea of exceptionalism, why America was created. That’s the kind of effort that’s worthwhile.
We could have done a lot to get beyond America First. We’ve been slow in filling out the community of policymakers and representatives that deal in international organizations, that deal with the U.N., that deal with public diplomacy and some of these other areas because we’ve got to get to a level beyond a bumper sticker. 
There’s much more that can be done, and I challenge you. We have to be part of that conversation and, if we’re not in the business of parsing, if we’re not in the business of doing the spade work to get to the real depth of issues, then we have failed as advisers, thinkers, policymakers in the community. 
Because at the end of the day, it’s about we own this. And what are we doing to advance the ideas that the role of government is limited, that it’s there to facilitate our freedom and our prosperity and our security in equal measure?

"In his address to the nation Wednesday, President Donald Trump’s re-upped–clearly and in no uncertain terms–his commitment to challenging Iran’s continuing efforts to run amok in the Middle East.
While Trump’s critics in the U.S. like to claim his policies are mercurial, inept and irresponsible, the Iranian regime no doubt knew exactly what he was going to say. After all, they gave him all the information needed to shape his speech.
First, Iran gave Trump the inept face-saving fireworks display  Wednesday morning, showering more than a dozen missiles on bases in Iraq where U.S. military forces are stationed. The “retaliatory” attack was a transparent attempt by the Iranian regime to save face with the folks back home.
Technically, Iranian leaders can tell their increasingly disaffected citizens that they’ve now done something to avenge the death of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, Iran’s chief architect of terrorism. But what they did was pretty much next to nothing.
To reduce the possibility of U.S. blowback, the Iranians actually notified Iraq before the missile shower–a message they surely know would be conveyed to the Americans and other coalition forces in the target areas.
As intended, the missiles did little damage. Then the regime quickly announced the payback was over. The message could not have been any clearer if the Iranians had said: Ladies and gentlemen, this is all a show.
Trump’s response was measured, responsible, and proportional – just as was the drone strike that killed Suleimani.
No, Trump said, the U.S. isn’t going to fire back at Tehran like in some cinematic Wild West shootout. Instead, the U.S. will continue to take actions designed to get Iran to “be better”–actions that will further isolate and punish the regime for its destabilizing behavior. 
Trump’s endgame also remains the same: limit the Iranian regime’s ability to wreak mayhem, while offering it the option of going back to the negotiating table to do a real deal–one that addresses the mullahs’ most troubling behaviors.
Odds are the Iranians knew this is exactly the speech they were going to get. Their face-saving strike that saved no face can be cold comfort at best.

"At least nine American women and children were slaughtered in northern Mexico on Monday, the victims of cartel violence.
Tragically, such carnage is all too common.
The unchecked power of criminal enterprises in Mexico poses an unacceptable threat, not just to Mexico, but to the entire Western Hemisphere. The cartels’ reach extends from the tip of Latin America to Northern Canada. It’s past time for a common effort to break them.
First, let’s be clear: This isn’t just about drugs. The cartels will traffic in anything that makes a buck. Most recently, they have cashed in on the rush to smuggle illegal aliens across the U.S. border. 
A report by RAND, for example, estimated that in 2017, the cartels made almost $3 billion from human smuggling. To repeat: The problem isn’t drugs—it’s the cartels.
These criminal networks aren’t just limited to the Western Hemisphere. Cartel smuggling networks extend to Africa, Europe, and Asia as well.
These gangs aren’t just smuggling operations; they are diversified enterprises. They engage in every manner of criminal activity from murder-for-hire to kidnapping, extortion, fraud, money laundering, car theft, and on and on. Their avarice, braveness, ambition, and unconstrained violence would awe Al Capone.
And, the danger they pose is not just to public safety. Where civic institutions and governance are weak, the criminal cartels intertwine with oligarchs. Together they seize control of political power and state-owned enterprises, creating a stranglehold that chokes off civil society, democracy, and the rule of law.
Venezuela is the poster child for this pernicious phenomenon. Nicolas Maduro has driven virtually the entire country into poverty—leading millions of refugees to flee the hellhole he and his cronies have created. Yet, despite international pressure, sanctions, and internal opposition, his illegitimate regime still clings to power. In part, Maduro is still there because his regime is fueled by drug cash from the criminal cartels.
Monday’s murder of innocent Americans—three women, two infants, and four other children—shocks because of the senselessness and the brutality. Yet the harsh truth is that cartel-related violence in Mexico kills tens of thousands every year. Many of these are just as innocent, their lives just as precious—people who deserved a far, far better fate.
While the cartels are the real enemy here, we have to acknowledge that the Mexican government’s way of countering the threat has been largely wrong-headed. 
Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, commonly called AMLO, has generally adopted the old leftist policy of seeking “social peace”—a policy dedicated to the proposition that, if the government doesn’t go after the cartels, the cartels won’t go after the government. 
Instead, the theory goes, they will largely confine their violence to terrorizing and murdering each other, and spend the rest of their time contentedly laundering their money and lounging by the pool.
AMLO’s way is clearly not working. Mexico’s homicide rate has skyrocketed over the last two years. Before AMLO, the record for homicide was about 28,000 in 2011. Last year, under AMLO, it was 35,000. This year will top that.
President Donald Trump has offered to partner with AMLO in fighting the cartels. AMLO should take him up on the offer. He won’t find a more resolute battle buddy. These two, very different leaders have proven they can work together. They have pressed for approval of a new trade deal.  They have worked together on border security and refugee policy. They can do this.
Trump and AMLO can go down in history as the leaders who broke the back of the cartels once and for all. AMLO should go for it.

"Yes, it’s up for this year’s “Best Picture” Oscar, but that hasn’t stopped critics delivering decidedly mixed reviews to “1917.” 
The plot is the stuff of a standard action/adventure flick: two soldiers on a desperate mission to stop a British unit from charging into a trap. 
At a more substantive level, however, it’s a movie about the humanity and inhumanity of war. On that front, it’s the best since “Saving Private Ryan” (1998) and definitely worth seeing.
Like Steven Spielberg’s tale of a squad of soldiers trampling around the Normandy countryside after D-Day, this Sam Mendes storyline is equally implausible. As a set piece of military history, it is to be scrupulously ignored. 
>>> Is Iran Headed for Regime Change?
Yet, there are reasons to engage with “1917” as a serious war film. 
For one, the movie gets the details exquisitely right. Here, “Saving Private Ryan” set a high bar. It would be difficult to have a more realistic appreciation for what it was like to land on “Bloody” Omaha Beach during the Normandy invasion without a time machine. 
More recently, Chris Nolan’s “Dunkirk” (2017) hit that mark, as well. 
These movies have avoided the kind of groaning missteps that detract from otherwise excellent movies like “Patton” (1970), which paraded around “German” armor that were clearly just American tanks painted up with Wehrmacht symbols. 
>>> US-China Trade Deal Is a Welcome First Step
While you can’t smell the retching horror of filth, decay, and cordite in the trenches, “1917” dwells on every visual cue from grinning corpses to the fat rats gorging on the detritus of war. 
To understand just how accurate the look of the movie is, compare “1917” to Peter Jackson’s incredible documentary “They Shall Not Grow Old” (2018), which relies exclusively on recovered archival footage from the World War I. 
The other point on which the film excels is portraying the human dimension of war. 
>>> Trump’s Iran Endgame Remains the Same
At the height of the European enlightenment when philosophers were talking about the perfection of human enterprises from economics to governance, Carl von Clausewitz, the great Prussian military theorist, said, “Not so fast.”
Clausewitz was himself a veteran of several campaigns—on both the winning and losing sides. One of the essential insights of his monumental treatise, “On War,” was that conflict was anything but a mechanistic, linear, predictable act. 
Soldiers, at their own peril, ignored the foibles, misjudgments, and shortfalls of men in battle and the importance of terrain, the unpredictability of weather, and the many other forces and factors that can determine the outcome of combat. He called it the “fog of war” and the “friction of battle.” 
>>> Let’s Be Thankful America Isn’t Fighting ‘Endless Wars’
In this film, Clausewitz would have lamented setbacks to the Prussian military, but he would have well appreciated the trials, tests, and uncertainties that confront the soldiers on the way to the front. 
Mostly, the film reminds viewers that it is never a good idea to think of war in antiseptic or abstract terms. Whether it’s the decision to go over the top or take out Qassim Suleimani, we must never forget that war is a competition between living, breathing, cunning, determined foes and that the price of failure and, oftentimes, success is always measured in blood and tragedy.

"Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei presents statements regarding ongoing protests across Iran on Nov. 27, 2019. (Photo: Iranian Supreme Leader Press Office/Handout/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)

Maryam Rostampour

Maryam Rostampour is an Iranian Christian who survived eight months in Iran's Evin Prison.

Marziyeh Amirizaeh

Marziyeh Amirizaeh is an Iranian Christian who survived persecution and a death sentence from the Iranian government.
In 2009, the Iranian government arrested and imprisoned us and sentenced us to death by hanging because of our evangelical Christian faith. We recounted that experience in the book “Captive in Iran.”
We have experienced firsthand the cruelty of the Iranian regime, including the intelligence officers and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps forces who were responsible for brutally torturing our best friend, Shirin Alam Hooli, a Kurdish activist, and her execution by hanging, among many of their other cruel actions. 
The Revolutionary Guard is notorious in Iran as a force behind all suppressions, arrests, tortures, and mass killings of many Iranians, including in the most recent protests last November, in which well over a thousand (and likely more) were killed, and many more were arrested. Also, the force is responsible for terrorist actions across the Middle East in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, and beyond.  
For many Iranians, including us, it was a relief to hear
that Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard
Corps’ elite Quds Force, was killed last week in a U.S.-led strike. Suleimani has
blood on his hands of not only Iranians, but also U.S. service members, Iraqis,
Afghanis, and Syrians. 
Most people in Iran are celebrating the death of a man who
murdered innocent Iranians as recently as the November protests. Unlike what is
shown in the Western media, people inside Iran are sending out videos through
social media that show they are privately dancing at their homes, celebrating
the death of Suleimani. Some even bake and give each other cookies to show
their happiness. 
In November, thousands of Iranians were brutally killed by
the regime’s agents, particularly by the Revolutionary Guard forces under the
leadership of Suleimani.
Many families lost their loved ones, including young
children, during the suppression of the protests. Some could not even get the
bodies of their children released or were forced to pay the price of the bullet
(thousands of dollars) to get their bodies returned. 
Other families, including that of Pouya Bakhtiari, were not even allowed to mourn or have a funeral for their children because the regime was afraid many Iranians would join and that would lead to another protest against the regime. 
If the people of Iran had the freedom to attend the funerals
of those who were killed during the recent protests, we would likely see
millions of Iranians show up and support the anti-regime movement. 
It is important to understand that the crowd that gathered
for Suleimani’s funeral does not represent the Iranian people at large.
Supporters of the regime and those who truly mourn the death of terrorist Suleimani
are in the minority. 
Most of those shown on state television are either paid by
the regime—such as Basijis—or forced to attend by regime security forces. On
Monday, four people were arrested because they expressed their happiness at
Suleimani’s death on social media, according to Iran
International. 
Since the death of Suleimani, the regime has shut down schools, bazaars (shops and places of business), and public offices and forced people to attend the funeral. It bused school children to the funeral and even forced them to cry for the TV cameras. 
The regime also ordered all traffic to be directed to the location
of the funeral so that even those who didn’t want to participate had no choice
but to join the crowd. It stopped all subways and trains and forced riders to leave
the stations and join the crowd in the streets. 
The funeral was just a big show orchestrated by the Iranian
regime to make it appear that Suleimani was beloved by the Iranian people, and that
they want revenge for his death—which is not what we’re hearing from firsthand
sources and Persian news sources. 
We know from our time in Iran that the regime uses threats
and force to make people attend ceremonies like this to show massive support
for the government. In school, our principals forced us to say, “Death to
America and death to Israel” every day before class and to attend speeches
whenever the president or other government authorities came to our city—and we
would be expelled if we didn’t attend. The same was true for high school and
university students. 
In general, if people do not attend such gatherings, they
will lose their jobs, public benefits, and even risk their lives and security. 
Meanwhile, much of the Western media seems to be partnering
with the Iranian government in spreading the propaganda that there is massive popular
support for the regime. Western media focused on the huge crowds mourning the
death of Suleimani and tried to show that people in Iran are angry about his
death and want revenge. 
The reality is that most Iranians love the United States and Americans, and would like to establish a friendly relationship with Israel and the U.S. and live in peace with other nations. 
Iran has been captured by this hostile regime and the mullahs
(religious leaders) for more than 40 years. Many Iranians who have been
suppressed by the regime have shown, through their protests, that they oppose the
regime and want to see it replaced. 
Most Iranians, including us, thank President Donald Trump
and his administration for standing with the Iranian people and adopting
policies that are weakening the regime’s power within Iran and in the region.
We also thank Trump for putting an end to Suleimani, a monster terrorist, and
other terrorist leaders who accompanied him.

Daniel Davis: President Trump appears to be lowering the temperature with Iran after a series of military flares provoked fears of war. 
Joining me now to unpack the latest developments is Luke Coffey, director of the Allison Center for Foreign Policy at The Heritage Foundation. Luke, thanks for your time.
Luke Coffey: Thanks. It’s my pleasure.
Davis: So, on Tuesday night, Iran launched over a dozen rockets at a U.S. base in Iraq. This was in response to the U.S. having killed its top general, Qassim Suleimani. What do you think Iran’s objective was?
Coffey: Well, their objective was to show that they are striking back against the United States to save face in the eyes of their public, but to do so in a way that does not provoke the United States even more to retaliate back.
And actually, one important distinction to make is that these are Iraqi bases inside Iraq, where American soldiers are located. These aren’t U.S. bases. And this is important to point out, because this was a very big violation of Iraq sovereignty as well, that Iran would shoot these missiles inside Iraq’s territory, at Iraqi bases where, yes, of course U.S. soldiers were located. 
And in one case, in northern Iraq, the one missile landed in Irbil at the airport, which is both the civilian airport and also has military personnel. 
So, it was highly provocative what Iran did.
Davis: So, you said that they were trying to save face with their public in Iran, while also not doing too much to provoke the U.S. again. Do you think they achieved that? Or did they do enough to appease the population in Iran who was upset over this?
Coffey: Well, for now, the answer, I would say, is yes. And because in around the way the government controls the narrative and controls the messages, it’s very easy for them to spin this into some great military success. 
I mean, in reality, we know that they fired 15 missiles. One landed at the airport in Irbil, four landed somewhere in the desert, and then the remaining missiles landed on that base in western Iraq. And there were no U.S. or Iraqi or coalition casualties, and very minimal damage to facilities on these bases.
So, it was enough, I think, where the regime in Iran could go to its people and say, “Look, we struck back,” and there’s already these wild rumors flying around on social media about so many U.S. service personnel wounded and being treated secretly in Israel. And, of course, Iran has to drag in Israel somehow. 
And we all know this is nonsense in the way our system of government works here. There’s no way the U.S. government could cover up something like this, but it’s enough where the Iranians probably were able to save face and had an off-ramp. And I think President [Donald] Trump recognized that. And that was clear by the tone of his remarks today.
Davis: So, it seems like the president sort of called Iran’s bluff. I mean, they’d been talking a really big game for months, and now they sort of blinked.
Coffey: That’s true. Certainly, President Trump comes out on top of all of this in many ways. And even some of his strongest critics have acknowledged this point as well. 
President Trump looks stronger. Iran looks weaker. President Trump over the past several months has shown a lot of restraint against Iranian aggression. There have been numerous occasions where the U.S. would have been justified to strike back. And President Trump chose not to, always trying to leave that door open for negotiations.
And in fact, I suspect that this proposal to take out Qassim Suleimani was not the first time he was given this option. Because [former U.N.  Ambassador John] Bolton tweeted over the weekend that this was a long time coming, which leads me to think that at least during his time in the White House, this was a proposal that was being floated around, and President Trump declined it. 
So, I think the president felt like he really had no other choice. He had to show the Iranians that the U.S. means business, and that’s what he did. And paradoxically, the demise of Qassim Suleimani might be looked upon as the de-escalatory strike, that’s the strike that deescalated the situation.
Davis: How so?
Coffey: Well, because until this point, the Iranians thought they could keep going and going and going, and the U.S. would just kind of tinker on the edges in terms of its response, and then that response was so great, that impact, it was so great. 
I don’t think we can overstate how important someone like Qassim Suleimani is to that, to the whole Iranian security apparatus. And whenever he was taken out, I think it probably gave some room for pause in Iran, and they probably thought, “Whoa, OK, can we afford another severe blow like this if we push the Americans too far when we retaliate?”
Davis: Yeah. President Trump had talked about how during the Obama administration, U.S. credibility as a deterrent force had really eroded. So, do you think this re-established American credibility?
Coffey: Certainly so in the eyes of the Iranians. I would say, the deterrence has been re-established in the eyes of our partners in the region who, to be honest, I think some were questioning American resolve over the past few months because a lot of things were happening. 
International oil tankers were being hit, a massive oil-production facility in Saudi Arabia had been taken offline by an Iranian attack, a U.S. drone was shot down by Iran in international airspace and, yes, it was just a drone without a pilot. But this drone cost almost $180 million, and there were no U.S. responses. 
Then, finally, I think enough was enough, and we now see that Qassim Suleimani is dead, and I think that sends a very strong message to the region, to both friend and foe alike.
Davis: President Trump in his speech on Wednesday to the nation proposed new economic sanctions on Iran. Given that Iran is already under lots of sanctions, what more can the U.S. do in this area?
Coffey: Well, there’s one kebab shop that’s left. In all seriousness, this is a very good question. And there are further areas that can be sanctioned further, banking and in other industries. 
The point with sanctions is that you have to leave room for maneuver. So, we hear this term, “maximum-pressure campaign,” but there are ways that we can increase the sanctions more, and yes, we have to get more and more creative as we do this. 
But it’s not as if every aspect of every industry in Iran has been totally sanctioned to the point where the U.S. can’t apply more sanctions.
Davis: We’ve often heard from our colleague here, Jim Phillips, at the Heritage Foundation, that Iran thinks in a very long cycles, thinks in terms of centuries, not in short news cycles. Do you think that there’ll be ramifications in later years for the killing of Qassim Suleimani? That they’ll have a long memory about that?
Coffey: For sure, without a doubt. And I don’t think we’ve actually seen the true impact of his demise yet. I think it’ll probably take years for us to see the impact of it. 
But in terms of how the Iranians will look at it? Well, actually I think there’s a good argument to be made about last night’s strike not being the only way that Iran will retaliate because of Suleimani’s death. 
Yes, I understand those arguments that even I just made about them saving face and it being an off-ramp, but also there’s a small part of me that thinks, well, maybe that was a faint, maybe they want everyone to think that everything is calm, everything is now OK, and we perhaps over a period of months become more complacent, and then they do something that’s even crazier. 
I think it’s unlikely, but I would not completely rule it out, because they do have very long memories, and we should not underestimate the impact that the demise of Qassim Suleimani will have.
He was a very talented, almost special individual. He had a unique knack for unconventional warfare. 
This is a guy who had only four or five years of formal education. He left his home at age 14 to work in construction, and by his early twenties, he was commanding a division during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, and then he’s just spent the past 20 years setting the Middle East on fire. 
And it all finally caught up with him. But nevertheless, he’s not going to be replaced very easily, because he was a unique individual, and it’s going to leave a huge gaping hole in Iran’s capabilities. And as we sort of seen in Iran with the mourning and the tens of thousands—perhaps hundreds of thousands—of people who’ve come onto the streets to say their goodbyes to Qassim Suleimani. 
Yes, of course, this is Iran, and it wouldn’t be the first time that the government has orchestrated something like this or forced people to go out and do this. But actually I think most of this is probably genuine.
The Iranians view him as a national hero, and have viewed him as such for a number of reasons. Not because he was very effective at what he did, but also he was always seen as one of these guys who came from nothing who sort of rose to the top and didn’t get too corrupted along the way. 
He was never very flashy. He wasn’t the type of Iranian elite who would have a house in France or wear designer clothes. He was a very humble person. And because of that, he was popular among many Iranians, and so the outcry that you see is probably genuine—although some of it probably is choreographed, but I would say for the most part is real. 
So, this has left a huge hole. … This has made a huge impression on the Iranian people, and also the Iranian elite. And they’re, like I said, there is a small part of me that thinks that they’re not going to let this slide so easily, and we should remain vigilant, and we should remain with our guard up for the foreseeable future.
Davis: Well, also on Wednesday, President Trump shifted away from overt military action and said he wants to get a new deal, a new nuclear deal with Iran. 
What are the prospects for that at this point, especially as we’ve seen deteriorating relations with Iran and that the old Iran deal is dead?
Coffey: Well, this is President Trump’s style. He prefers negotiation. He prefers making a deal. His instincts are not to go to war. He does not want to go to war with Iran. He’s not looking for a fight. 
The last thing he wants during an election year is Operation Persian Freedom. This would be hugely unpopular for him, and most Americans don’t want it either. So, he’s always kept this door open for a deal. 
And even in his speech he gave us today from the White House, he suggested, even went so far as to suggest that there are areas that Iran and the U.S. can cooperate on, in terms of defeating ISIS, for example, which is a pretty bold statement to make—which, of course, ISIS is the enemy of both Iran and the United States. But that doesn’t necessarily make the United States and Iran partners. 
But it was a very bold statement to make, and I think it sends a signal that he is willing to keep that door open for diplomacy, and I think that’s very important.
Davis: So in terms of a nuclear deal, I mean where do you even start at this point on a new deal?
Coffey: Well, right now, we’re back at the basics of confidence-building. We’re nowhere close to the Iranians and the American sitting around the table and hammering out a new deal at this point. 
I think that it’s going to take a … we’ll need a period of months of calmness and hopefully that’s what we’re entering right now. 
If Iran is smart, President Trump has shown today that he doesn’t want to escalate it anymore. If [the] Iranians are smart, they won’t escalate it any more, and we can see where we go in the next few months.
Davis: I’m just curious, your take, in Iran, do you think a nuclear deal now with the U.S. would be seen as submitting to the U.S.?
Coffey: Well, I don’t know if the regime really has to worry about that. They don’t have to worry about public opinion in the same way that democracies do, and they can control the narrative a lot better. 
That’s why they can lob 15 missiles into Iraq, 11 of which only hit the target, four completely miss altogether, and they claim as being some great military success. Only in Iran can you do that, or perhaps North Korea, or a few other very closed societies.
The Iran deal itself wasn’t all—the original [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action] deal agreed under [President Barack] Obama—wasn’t all that popular in some parts of Iran anyway. 
Many of the average Iranians who thought the lifting of sanctions was going to bring new economic opportunities, never saw the economic windfall. It mainly helped many of the elites at the very top. And then there was an internal debate inside the Iranian leadership about the merits of this deal. 
I mean, this deal was never passed by their Majles, which is their version of the parliament. So, it wasn’t exactly widely supported in Iran at the time either. I mean, it was a very controversial deal, whether it was in Washington or Tehran. Really, the only place it enjoyed huge levels of popularity was Europe.
Davis: Do you think that the Iran deal contributed to the current situation we’re in with Iran?
Coffey: Well, certainly it emboldened them with lots of cash and money and diplomatic legitimacy, emboldened their willingness to well assert themselves more on the global stage, because they were treated as, well, they’re sort of taken out of the “pariah” camp and brought more into the mainstream. 
President Trump’s claim today that the money they were given because of the Iran deal funded the missiles that were used to attack U.S. forces. It was a very tenuous, it’s difficult to prove that. 
I mean … there is no doubt in my mind the money that they got from the Iran deal was used to fuel their proxy forces, and their export of terrorism across the Middle East. But I mean, in terms of assigning a certain amount of money to certain missiles, I think, is probably very difficult if not impossible to do.
But I think it was, I don’t think President Trump meant that literally. I think it was more of an illustrative point that … when you unfreeze $150 billion in cash, and you give it to the Iranians, almost overnight, when you remove major international sanctions overnight, they’re going to enjoy certain benefits. 
And the reality is, they weren’t using this money to build new schools and roads and hospitals in Iran. Their behavior across the Middle East after signing the Iran deal with President Obama did not change. 
Yes, they had more restrictions on their nuclear production. They weren’t perfect restrictions, that’s for sure. They were restricted, but not completely restricted. But in terms of their other malign acts, supporting proxy groups and fighting in Yemen and Syria and in Iraq and Lebanon, they continued to do so, and in fact increase this sort of activity. 
So, it has zero impact on their behavior in the region.
Davis: I want to ask you about Iraq, too. After the killing of Suleimani, the Iraqi parliament voted for U.S. forces to leave Iraq. How does all of this bode for the U.S.-Iraqi relationship?
Coffey: We should remember that this vote that was taken a few days ago in the Iraqi parliament was a nonbinding vote—so, symbolic. And about half of the parliamentarians didn’t even show up to vote. Only the parliamentarians linked to Shia parties, which are closely aligned with certain groups in Iran, showed up to vote. 
The Sunni- and Kurdish-dominated parties, they boycotted the vote. So, Iraq is divided on this issue. We should not pretend that every Iraqi wants the U.S. to leave. And we shouldn’t also pretend that every Iraqi wants the U.S. to stay. I think it’s a little more complicated than that.
But, for sure, the U.S. is not going to be kicked out anytime soon from Iraq. And I think even those Iraqi statesman, the Iraqi parliamentarians, lawmakers, officials, regardless if they’re Sunni, Shia, or Kurdish, they know that despite some of their rhetoric about wanting the U.S. forces to leave, they know that they do not want [a repeat of] 2011, when U.S. forces were removed by President Obama and a few months later, ISIS is on the gates of Baghdad. No one wants to repeat of that. 
So, a lot of the stuff, I would say, is for domestic consumption. Politicians in Baghdad have constituents in the same way politicians in Washington or London or Paris do as well. Sometimes, things are said and done to cater to that constituency. And that’s probably what we’re seeing a lot of today in Iraq.
Davis: In his speech, President Trump also called on NATO to play a greater role in the Middle East. What’s been keeping NATO from taking on a greater role, and what would that look like?
Coffey: Well, I about fell out of my chair when I heard that. As someone who focuses, most of my career has been focused on NATO and transatlantic security, I couldn’t believe—I didn’t know where he was going with it, if I’m honest with you. And there are no further details. 
NATO’s area of responsibility, if you look at the original 1949 treaty, is the North Atlantic region, north of the Tropic of Cancer. Right? So it’s mainly the European region. 
Yes, NATO forces are in Afghanistan after 9/11, but I think that was a result of, at that time, NATO not sure what its mission was. It didn’t really have this, the same mission that it had during the Cold War.
But now with Russia back on the march in Europe, fighting in Ukraine, occupying parts of Ukraine, threatening the Baltic states, threatening NATO members—I think NATO as an institution should remain focused in Europe.
It doesn’t need to be in the Middle East. But that being said, remember NATO is a collection of countries. So, while NATO as an institution probably shouldn’t take a bigger role in the Middle East, the countries that form NATO should probably play a bigger role in the Middle East.
Davis: I mean, do you think that was maybe just Trump signaling he wants the U.S. to distance itself, and other European countries to take more of a footprint?
Coffey: Exactly. If I was translating that from Trump language, I would say that it was, Americans have done enough in the Middle East.
Davis: No more stupid wars.
Coffey: It’s time for others to do more, and Europe should do more. He doesn’t, he didn’t, I don’t think he really meant NATO. I think he actually means Europe, but who knows?
Davis: Well, in a separate news story, a Ukrainian airliner crashed just outside of Tehran, minutes after it took off and only hours after Iran had launched its rocket attacks on Iraq. 
The crash killed all 176 people onboard. What do you make of this? Could this—I mean, some are speculating that this, the timing of it and the location, signals this could have been an accidental strike by Iranian rockets.
Coffey: It’s very tragic and sad, and I feel bad for all the passengers and their families and the crew that were on that plane. 
The question or the reality is, we don’t know right now what happened. But because of the circumstances, you cannot rule out that the plane wasn’t accidentally shot down, but we don’t know. And there are all these stories out there now, the Iranians are not going to share the black box … but there are pictures that are surfacing on social media. 
So, no doubt … these forensic experts that are online will be piecing together the clues, and we’ll have a bit more of a picture in the coming days, I suspect. But I think it was highly irresponsible of the Iranians to launch an attack like this, and at the same time allow planes to land and depart from their major civilian international airports.
Presumably, they knew that this rocket attack was 15 rockets. Who knows how much time it took to fire off these 15 rockets? But I’m going to guess, probably not very much. So why couldn’t they just temporarily close the airspace? 
They gave the Iraqis apparently a warning that this attack was coming. The U.S. actually last night issued, the FAA issued a warning, to U.S. aircraft in the [Persian Gulf] that because of heightened military activity, they were to avoid certain regions of the Middle East. 
So … I don’t know why the Iranians didn’t think to do the same thing. Was this plane accidentally shot down? Who knows? Was it a terrorist attack? Who knows? Or was it an accident? Who knows? And we may never know the truth because of where this, this accident, this tragedy happened. 
But it does just further complicate the situation, because it’s Iran, because it happened the same night that these attacks were taking place. And then you throw in the fact that it’s Ukraine, and with their war going on and the bad luck that country’s had, it’s just sad all around.
Davis: So, one of the recent controversies this week has been whether the U.S. would attack Iranian cultural sites. President Trump recently hinted at that, but then said he wouldn’t do it. 
Our colleague here at Heritage, Jim Carafano, has pointed out that Iran maybe hides its facilities under cultural sites or mixes that category. Can you explain what that’s about?
Coffey: It has been known that Iran has had some of its nuclear facilities near historical sites, religious sites, and that’s always created a problem. They’ve sort of used these locations as protection, so to speak. 
But the U.S. military is very used to operating in environments with cultural sites and religious sites. And for example, I remember when I was serving in Afghanistan, we cannot return fire—like artillery fire, for example, when rockets were launched at us—if the location that were where we were firing was within a certain proximity of even a library or a school. 
So, the U.S. is very careful about this and cannot imagine a situation where the Department of Defense would willingly, for no apparent reason other than to strike it, target a cultural site, because these cultural sites in Iran, they’re not the Islamic Republic’s cultural sites.
In many ways, these belong to the world. These date back thousands of years. Iran, the Persian people are one of the great civilizations of the world. And we should never allow the Islamic Republic to hijack that and to think that they have some sort of unique control or ownership of that. 
So, I don’t know what President Trump was saying at the time or what he meant, but he did quickly walk this back. So, I don’t think he really had in mind that he was going to attack UNESCO sites in Iran, but certainly Iran has a history of putting some of their research facilities and some of their production facilities near these important sites.
Davis: Interesting. Well, we’ll keep following all of this at The Daily Signal. Luke Coffey, really appreciate your time today.
Coffey: Thank you.

"The Obama administration pursued a policy of strengthening Iran economically--and did so while openly acknowledging that Iran would use that new economic strength to pursue terrorism and ballistic missile testing.

President Donald Trump launched a global round of teeth gnashing when he ordered the killing of the greatest terrorist leader in the modern Middle East, Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani.  
Suleimani was unquestionably responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Americans in Iraq and thousands of others throughout the Middle East—mostly Muslim. His global terror network ran from South America to Europe to Africa to Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and Iraq.  Suleimani was an unparalleled organizer and a pitiless murderer. His death was richly earned.
But for many in the media and on the domestic and international left, Trump’s action was precipitously “provocative.” 
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called  Suleimani ‘s killing—which came directly after a  Suleimani-approved terror assault on America’s embassy in Baghdad and amidst reported further plans for escalated terror against American targets–“disproportionate.” 
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., suggested that Trump, not the Iranians, had “escalated” the situation. Former Vice President Joe Biden said that Trump had “just tossed a stick of dynamite into a tinderbox.”
This reaction has been magnified by the media, many of whom have been speculating about the possibility of all-out war between the United States and Iran. Think pieces have been written about whether the United States will reactivate the draft (spoiler alert: No, we won’t). Musings have filled the newspapers about the supposed conflagration prompted not by Iranian evil but by Trumpian reactivity.
All of this smacks less of legitimate concern about what comes next than it does of sheer panic that Trump has overturned a decade of American and European appeasement of the Iranian regime. 
Ben Rhodes, former President Barack Obama’s deputy national security adviser, architect of the Iran deal, and an overt liar who told the American public that Iran was on its way to moderation if only the United States would loosen economic restrictions on the terror state, has placed blame for volatility squarely before Trump. 
Susan Rice, Obama’s national security adviser during the Iran deal and another overt liar who told the American public that Islamic terror against our Benghazi embassy was rooted in anger over a YouTube video, soberly informed Americans that “Americans would be wise to brace for war.” 
Biden suggested that in throwing out the Iran deal, Trump had paved the way for war—and, oh, by the way, the Iran deal was “airtight.”
This is a deliberate misreading of history designed to absolve the Obama administration of its Iran policy debacle. 
The administration pursued a policy of strengthening Iran economically—and did so while openly acknowledging that Iran would use that newly gained economic strength to pursue terrorism and ballistic missile testing. In speaking of the sanctions relief given to Iran, then-Secretary of State John Kerry explained in January 2016, “I think that some of it will end up in the hands of the IRGC or other entities, some of which are labeled terrorists.” 
That’s precisely what happened. In March 2016, then-U.S. Central Command nominee Army Gen. Joseph Votel said that Iran had become “more aggressive” since the advent of the nuclear deal. Indeed, Iran has built up Hezbollah in Lebanon, propped up Bashar Assad in Syria, increased its presence in Iraq and bolstered its war in Yemen. In the past few months, Iran and its proxies have attacked shipping in the Strait of Hormuz, Saudi oil facilities, an American drone and an American embassy, among other targets. All of this occurred while the Trump administration did little or nothing in response. 
Then Trump ordered the killing of Suleimani. Suddenly, we have been informed by dishonest Democrats and their media allies, Iran has gone rogue. 
Nonsense. Iran has been rogue for decades. The Iran deal was simply an attempt to whistle past the graveyard with the terror regime—to pay it off long enough so that President Barack Obama could declare the problem handled. This was, after all, the Obama strategy in Crimea and Syria: Declare a red line; run away from it; pretend that pusillanimous inaction is bravery and deterrence provocation.
Trump thought differently. Now Iran has come face to face with the prospect that actions have consequences— and those consequences don’t involve pallets of cash being shipped over to fund terror organizations that span the globe.

"Iran’s Islamist dictatorship has been challenged and rebuked in recent weeks by massive political protests—not only at home, but also in the spheres of influence that the regime carved out in Iraq and in Lebanon.
In all three countries, the popular protests reportedly erupted spontaneously and initially focused on economic issues, particularly high prices, lack of jobs, and corruption. 
But gradually, the protests evolved into full-blown anti-government movements, as unaccountable and corrupt regimes blocked any progress toward reforms that would address the protesters’ legitimate demands.
In Iran, the biggest demonstrations since the 2009 Green Movement protests over Iran’s rigged presidential election were triggered by the regime’s decision to abruptly raise gasoline prices by roughly 50%.  
Hit hard by U.S. sanctions, Tehran was forced to reduce its heavy subsidies for domestic fuel prices. Rather than having the sanctions lifted through diplomatic engagement and compromise, the regime chose to continue on its path of confrontation with the United States, intimidation of its neighbors, and lavish support for terrorist proxies.
Long-suffering Iranians, fed up with the economic mismanagement, corruption, and misplaced priorities of their repressive government, flooded the streets of Iran’s cities Nov. 15 to protest the price increases. 
The demonstrators also focused their ire on the regime’s expensive interventions in regional conflicts.  In Isfahan, they chanted: “No to Gaza, no to Lebanon. We sacrifice our lives for Iran.” 
The regime responded with systematic violence against unarmed protesters, who were attacked by internal security forces, particularly the paramilitary thugs of the Basij militia, who beat them up and fired live rounds into crowds at close range.
The regime
suppressed the internet to prevent Iranians from mobilizing through the use of
social media.  
Tehran blamed the
protests on a foreign conspiracy hatched by Iranian opposition groups based
abroad and the usual suspects; namely, the United States, Israel, Britain, and
Saudi Arabia.
As protests
subsided, the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Gen. Hossein
Salami, proclaimed that Iran had defeated the foreign conspiracy behind the
unrest, which was part of the “world war” between Iran and “arrogant powers.”
Salami claimed that the Revolutionary Guards had
acted with “self-restraint” despite the fact that at least 143 Iranians were
killed in the protests, according to Amnesty International. 
Iranian authorities claim that 70 gas stations, 731 banks, and 140 government sites were torched during the uprising. It claimed more than 1,000 Iranians were arrested, although outside estimates put the number at close to 4,000.
Iraq Protests Pose More Challenges   
The Iranian
regime also has been a target of protesters in neighboring Iraq, who resent
Iranian influence over the Shiite political parties that dominate Iraq’s weak
coalition government.  
Young Iraqis have
staged massive anti-government protests since early October, fed up with high
rates of unemployment, endemic corruption, and poor public services.
Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi made a halfhearted effort to satisfy the protesters by calling for some reforms, but their demands hardened in response to escalating repression from the government.
Iraq’s crackdown on protesters reportedly was orchestrated by Iran’s viceroy for Iraq, Gen. Qassem Soleimani. 
Soleimani, commander of the elite Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which is responsible for coordinating with Iran-backed militias, also pushed Iraqi militia leaders last month to reject demands for Abdul Mahdi to step down. 
The result has been a bloodbath amid a deepening crisis in Iraq. More than 430 protesters have been killed, and thousands have been wounded since Oct. 1.
Perhaps surprisingly,
most of the protesters have been Iraqi Shiites, who belong to the same Islamic
sect as most Iranians. The Shiite heartland in southern Iraq, which provides most of Iraq’s oil
exports but receives few of its benefits, has seen some of the biggest and
bloodiest protests.
As Iran-backed Iraqi militias stepped up their attacks on protesters, Iran increasingly has been denounced by Iraqi Shiites. On Nov. 27, protesters attacked and set on fire the Iranian consulate in Najaf, the Shiite holy city that serves as the seat of Iraq’s Shiite religious establishment.
 “We went for the consulate because now we are aware who is the reason behind all that we are going through,” a local activist told The Washington Post. “Iran controls all these Islamic parties and their armed militias in the streets that have made our life like hell. They are controlling the economy of the city and everything goes to them. Meanwhile, we can’t even get a job.”
Significantly, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Husseini al-Sistani, Iraq’s top Shiite religious leader, rejects Iran’s radical brand of Shiite ideology and has supported the protesters against Iraq’s corrupt political leaders. 
After the grand ayatollah called for a change of leadership, Abdul Mahdi announced Nov. 29 that he would step down.
Finding a suitable successor will be a difficult task. Under the Iraqi Constitution, President Barham Salih is required to ask the largest bloc in parliament to nominate a new prime minister. 
But that process is unlikely to satisfy Iraqi protesters, many of whom call for the ouster of all current political leaders and a complete overhaul of Iraq’s corrupt power-sharing system.  
Revolting Against the Revolution
The alienation of
Iraqi Shiites isn’t Iran’s only problem. In Lebanon, where anti-government protests sparked by a new tax on messaging
services have continued since Oct. 17, the influence and reputation of
Hezbollah, Iran’s most powerful terrorist proxy, is increasingly threatened.
As in Iraq,
Lebanese protests have attracted strong support from Shiites dissatisfied with
the performance of Shiite political parties that have been radicalized,
supported, and guided by Iran.
Although
Hezbollah once was regarded as the champion of Lebanon’s Shiite community and
protector of Lebanon’s national interests against Israel, it increasingly is
perceived to be primarily serving Iran’s interests.  
Thousands of
Hezbollah fighters were deployed to Syria under the command of Iran’s
Revolutionary Guards to shore up the regime of Bashar al-Assad, Iran’s junior
ally.
U.S. sanctions on Iran and Hezbollah have severely undermined the ability of both to buy political support through economic means. Moreover, Hezbollah has been feeding from the trough of Lebanese government corruption and has violently opposed efforts to reform Lebanon’s unsustainable political power-sharing system.  
Young Shiites now increasingly see Hezbollah as part of Lebanon’s problem, not the solution. Hezbollah’s image has been tarnished further by its efforts to disrupt and intimidate Lebanon’s protest movement.
Iraq and Lebanon
are on a trajectory to become failed states if Tehran continues on its current
course.
Like Iran’s
radical regime, Lebanese and Iraqi Islamists supported by Iran have been forced
to suppress the efforts of reformers, including Shiites whom they claim to
champion.  
In the short run, the Islamists are likely to retain power through the coercive force of their militias and Revolutionary Guards. But in the long run, Iran’s aging ayatollahs and their Arab proxies have little to offer young Muslims except repression, economic dysfunction, ideological struggle, and endless conflict.
The harder Iran’s dictatorship struggles to oppose reforms that threaten its power, the sooner young Iranians and Arabs forced to live under Tehran’s thumb will reach the conclusion that Iran’s Islamist model is bankrupt economically, politically, and morally.

"Qassim Suleimani was leader of Iran's elite Quds Force and spent decades building a network of proxies hostile to the U.S. and its allies. (Photo: Pool/Iranian Supreme Leader Press Office/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)
U.S. forces killed one of Iran’s most powerful men, Qassim Suleimani, early Friday morning in Baghdad. He was leader of the elite Quds Force, the division of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps that conducts spying and terrorist operations outside Iran, and the order came directly from President Donald Trump. Jim Carafano of The Heritage Foundation unpacks the details, what led to the attack, and what to look for next. Read the lightly edited interview, posted below, or listen to the podcast:

Daniel Davis: Thanks for joining us for a special edition of The Daily Signal Podcast. We’re back early from our Christmas hiatus because of some major developments in the Middle East. 
U.S. forces have killed General Qassim Suleimani in Baghdad. He was the leader of Iran’s elite Quds Force. Joining me to unpack it all is Jim Carafano, The Heritage Foundation’s vice president for foreign and defense policy studies. Jim, thanks for your time.
Jim Carafano: Hey, great to be with you.
Davis: So we know now that President [Donald] Trump actually ordered this attack on Iran’s top general. Why did he take out the general in Baghdad?
Carafano: Yeah, so, well, first of all, Suleimani is probably the world’s most dangerous terrorist. He runs the Quds Force, this is part of the Iranian [Revolutionary Guard], which is basically responsible for all the covert operations, terrorist acts, managing the surrogates overseas, personally responsible for thousands of deaths, including hundreds of Americans who died because of [improvised explosive device] attacks. 
And the Iraqi, the Iranians have actually [been] attacking U.S. people in Iraq now for over a year, the official number is there’s been 19 attacks. The real number is there’s much, much more than that. 
So, all this stuff in the embassy, which preceded this, that was just the latest attack. But the better question is, why now? Right? Suleimani has been around forever, right? He’s been designated by the U.S. as a head of a foreign terrorist organization forever. 
So here’s what happened, when [President Barack] Obama pulled out of Iraq back in 2011 and ISIS metastasized … we went back in, the Iraqis let us back in. We were doing operations in Iraq and Syria principally focused on killing ISIS. 
Now, what the Iranians were doing during all that time is they were infiltrating their people and their influence out, getting more control of what’s called the Shia militias, so you have Kurds, Sunnis, and Shias in Iraq. The Shias are the majority population, that’s why they control the government. And the Iranians were infiltrating them, bribing, threatening, corrupting, getting control of them. We didn’t do much about it because to be honest, we were all fighting ISIS. So there was kind of a cease-fire, right? 
And after ISIS is destroyed now, what the Iranians have done trying to push back on Trump and his isolation is they’ve tried a bunch of different things. They tried blocking the straits, they tried cutting off oil, they tried bombing Saudi Arabia, they tried shooting down an American drone, and now what they’ve done is weaponize the Iraqi militias that are controlled by Iran in Iraq to attack Americans.
So that’s why now. And because he was actually in a foreign country in Iraq, plotting terrorist Iraqians to kill Americans. So there’s every bit as rational, logical reason to kill him as there was to kill Osama bin Laden. 
The stunning thing is, what the heck was he doing in Baghdad? He was arguably the most wanted terrorist of United States, the guy that’s in charge of killing Americans in Iraq. 
What is he doing kind of out in the open in Baghdad? It’s like Yamamoto deciding to vacation in Waikiki or Osama bin Laden planning his next terrorist attack from a hotel in Times Square. That was such a brazen, in-your-face act. 
If the United States did not do that, that would have rippled throughout the region. What the U.S. did is not an escalation, it was a very justifiable, very proportionally, very rational act of self-defense. On the other hand, if we hadn’t done that, there would just be more killing of Americans today.
Davis: Yeah, he was caught at the airport in Baghdad just a couple of days after the U.S. Embassy had been burning in Baghdad. What’s the connection between him and what happened at the embassy?
Carafano: Well, here’s the untold story, right? So the U.S. Embassy is in the middle of something called a green zone. It’s hundreds of acres, right? That is surrounded by Iraqi security. So unlike the attack at some of these other U.S. bases, you’ve got to get through all that Iraqi security to get to the embassy. Well, how did that happen? Because they literally walked through. And the answer is, somebody told them to walk through. 
So, one of the untold stories of all this is the Iranians really overreached in their attack on the embassy because by doing that, all the people that were responsible for that security that allowed that to happen or of criticism, they just gave us a blueprint of everybody in the Iraqi government security forces who are working with the Iranians.
Davis: So, they’re basically like double agents. They say they’re working for Iraq and complying with the U.S., protecting our personnel, and then letting the Iranians through. Who was it that was actually attacking the embassy though? I mean, were they Iranian?
Carafano: Hezbollah, which is an Iraqi Shia militia that is funded and directed by the Iranians. And one of the guys killed in the strike with Qasem Suleimani, the head of the Quds Force, was one of the heads of the Hezbollah militia that attacked the U.S. Embassy.
Davis: Wow. So does this killing seriously weaken Iran’s position in the Middle East? Or is it sort of you take the head off the snake and another one’s going to take its place?
Carafano: Yeah, I mean, I think it probably disrupted operations in the short term. And a lot of people said this is an escalation, which it’s just not. It is clearly an act of American self-defense. There’s no question about that. 
But, well, Iran will try and get back at us and my answer is, “Well, what are they going to do?” Look, there’s not going to be a conventional war. The Iranians can’t get to the United States. We’re certainly not stupid enough to invade Iran. 
Well, what can they do? Well, they do have a lot of capabilities. They have surrogates, you have Hezbollah, the Shia militias in Iraq, you have Islamic Jihad, Hamas in Palestine. You’ve got the Houthi rebels in Yemen. They can unleash them on the U.S. or their allies. OK? They can try to do terrorist attacks in the United States or Europe.
They can try to close the Straits of Hormuz. They can try to interdict shipping. They can even attack America’s friends and allies in the region like Saudi Arabia. 
Now, that list I just gave you, over the last year they’ve tried to do all those things, right? So the answer is they’re probably going to try to do more of the same. 
I think that the notion of war talk is pretty … I mean, in some sense we’re already at war. I mean, you storm an American Embassy, dude, that’s an act of war. But in another sense, we’re not going to escalate to a conventional conflict because our capabilities are very what we call asymmetrical. Right? We don’t really have the stuff to get at them, they don’t really have the stuff to get at us. 
So what I expect the Iranians to do is kind of more of the same. And what the United States has demonstrated so far is that kind of activity, if it kills an American, it’s going to provoke a response. And what it’s certainly not going to do is cause the Americans to back down.
Davis: Something we haven’t mentioned is that Suleimani is not just a general, there’s really a political dimension to his power. Right?
Carafano: Absolutely.
Davis: He’s really the right hand man of the Ayatollah.
Carafano: So the other thing, when people say, “Well, how do people in Iran and Iraq respond to this?” And the answer is, you’re going to see both. You will see people in Iran, and we’ve already seen that, mourning his loss, vowing vengeance, and everything. Who are those people? Those are the people that are owing to the regime, right? They are people that support the regime. 
On the other hand, there are vast swaths of Iranians who have been protesting and fighting back against their government for months, many of whom have been oppressed, tortured, and killed by his people. They’re kind of like going, “Yeah, baby.” Right? They’re happy he’s dead. Now maybe they’re not going to go out in the street and start cheering because they don’t want to get shot in the back of the head.
Davis: Is that a minority of people, though, in Iran? Or do you think that most people are probably secretly happy?
Carafano: No, I think that everybody that hates the regime hates the Quds Force and hates Suleimani. My guess is that’s a very significant chunk of the population. And we’ve seen that by the scope and the persistence of the protests in Iran. 
In Iraq, it’s kind of the same thing. Remember there are Kurds, Sunnis, and Shia in Iraq, the largest group is the Shia. The smallest is actually the Sunnis. Saddam Hussein was a Sunni. And one of the problems was that you had a small Sunni group essentially dictating the country. 
And then you have the Kurds, right? Which are often kind of their own little area. So the Kurds are just saying, “Dude, we’re just staying out of this.” Right? They’re just staying in Kurdistan being Kurds. 
And by the way, they hate Suleimani because Suleimani helped kill a lot of the peshmerga and killed them, too. So, they’re not shedding any tears in Kurdistan.
The Sunnis, they’re being oppressed by Iran and their allies. They have used these militias not just to go after Americans, but to kill all the Sunni opposition. 
I mean, if you’re a politician and you don’t play ball with the United States, we might cut off your money, maybe not give you a visa and not talk to you. If you’re a politician and you shun the Iranians, they’re going to find somebody to put a bullet in the back of your head. So the Sunnis, they’re cheering that this guy’s dead. 
Now, the Shias are kind of split. There are Shias that are beholden to the Iranian regime, obviously, they’re very angry. Many of those people are actually in government because the Shias are the dominant force in government. So when you have government officials saying, “We object to what the Americans are doing,” those are government officials who are essentially working for the Iranians.
And then you have Shia who are very nationalistic and who love their country and are very patriotic and they’re actually glad Suleimani’s dead, right? They don’t want to be a suburb of Tehran. 
So, people say, “Well, the people are protesting.” You got to ask the question, “Well, who’s protesting and what are they protesting about?” 
If you remember people tried to say that the people that were protesting at the U.S. Embassy were just like the people that were protesting over the last couple of months. Completely different. 
The people that had been protesting in Iraq were people protesting against Iran, hundreds of them were killed, thousands of them were wounded, all really at the direction of the Iranian regime. The people that attacked the embassy, those were terrorists and they were attacking a U.S. facility, they weren’t mourners or protesters.
Davis: You mentioned Iran’s proxies around the world, ways that they have to strike at the U.S. and our allies. The State Department is telling Americans now to get out of Iraq because they now have targets on them. Does that apply around the world, too? Should the U.S. personnel expect to be more of a target from proxies?
Carafano: Part of the problem with it is what’s changed, in terms of Iran looking to go after American assets worldwide. What’s changed from Tuesday? And the answer is nothing, right? So, I mean, I think if there is an Iranian presence or influence, I mean, we already had to be concerned about that before. So, I don’t think anything’s has really—
Davis: But isn’t there a kind of honor element? You’ve talked about how in their culture, being attacked is kind of a humiliation for them and now they sort of have more of an incentive to lash out?
Carafano: Right, but it’s also not a suicide pact, right? So, we’ve humiliated them before. I mean, they’ve done a number of different acts and we have basically responded and made them look weak. Their answer is just to try to do something else, which I assume they will do something here. 
They will try to respond in some way and look strong, but they’re not going to do it in a way that really escalates conflict because I think that’s more of a danger to them than it is to us actually. 
They’ve got a very weak political hold at home. The Ayatollah is very old. Their economy is in shatters. And the interesting thing is people always talked about the Iranian-Russian-Chinese Alliance. The Russians and Chinese have done nothing for them.
So Iran is really on its own when it comes to combating the U.S. Matter of fact, the one thing that hasn’t got a lot of press, which I think makes me angrier than everything, is that one of the first countries to come out and condemn the U.S. defending itself against Iranian terrorists in Iraq was Russia. 
And what’s ironic about that was just last week the president of Russia called the president of the United States to thank him because the [U.S.] helped thwart a terrorist attack aimed at Russia. So, if you help stop a terrorist attack aimed at Russia, you’re a hero—I mean, that’s good—but if you defend yourself against a terrorist attack, apparently, according to the Russian perspective, that’s bad.
Davis: Well, you said that conventional war is really not a possibility here, but could you imagine a situation where Iranian proxies do strike out more and the president orders some kind of strike in Iran? Maybe on oil facilities? Is that within the realm of possibility?
Carafano: I think [it’s] least likely that the United States would directly attack facilities inside Iran without some kind of major provocation. I don’t know if it’s necessarily off the table. 
Look, here’s what we know about this president—this is what the critics have just maybe been, I don’t know, sleeping the last couple of years—he’s been through a lot of crises. Iraq, Iran, back to Iraq, back to Iran, back to North Korea, terrorist attacks. He’s been very steady and when he has used force, it’s always been restrained and proportional, right?
In Syria against a chemical weapons attack and, I mean, if I can remember, when the Iranians shot down a drone, we did nothing, that wasn’t an act of weakness. We did other [things] to punish the Iranians for that act, but we didn’t go in and start blowing up facilities in Iran, which, when you think about it, how does that even make sense? The guy that ordered the shoot-down of that drone is not some poor schlep who’s in the [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps] who’s sitting in a base in Iran. But when they cross the line and kill an American, the president goes after the people that did that.
If you look at the attack on the Saudi territory, that was an attack on Saudi territory, not an attack on Americans. If you noticed, after we put Americans in that area, the Iranians didn’t do that again. 
So, why have the Iranians gotten so bold and still they’re not directly coming after us, because they’re not, they’re having the Iraqis do it, right? Why are they doing that though? They’re running out of options. That’s one. Maybe they just don’t believe the president when he says, “Don’t do this.” I don’t know.
Davis: Well, we’ll keep watching the developments closely. Jim, as always, thank you for your time.
Carafano: Thanks for having me.

Daniel Davis: Joining me now to discuss the recent shooting at a naval base in Florida is Cully Stimson, a senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation and a veteran who served in the Navy for 27 years. Cully, thanks for your time today.
Cully Stimson: It’s always a pleasure.
Davis: Last Friday, a Saudi airman shot up a U.S. Navy base in Pensacola and killed three people. What do we know so far about the suspect and a possible motive?
Stimson: No. 1, he’s dead. No. 2, he was part of an international coalition of people who we routinely have in our military bases across all the services. He was attending with other Saudi pilots basic pilot training at Pensacola, which is the heart and soul of naval aviation in the United States Navy.
Davis: Any early indications of a potential motive?
Stimson: It’s a little too early to tell. The FBI has the con here, and having worked as a former federal prosecutor, I can tell you the FBI’s very thorough and they’re not going to get out in front of the facts.
But from what has been publicly reported so far, we know that this young lieutenant went back and forth to home, as all international and domestic students do during breaks; that he had been a student for a while in this basic aviation course; that there had been a report of a complaint he had filed against one of his instructors because in the naval aviation community, they’re sort of bawdy and they come up with nicknames for people. 
When you saw “Top Gun,” for example, you saw one of the pilots was named Goose and another guy was named Mustang. One of the instructors allegedly had given him a nickname, which he didn’t find acceptable, so he filed a complaint against the instructor.
Months went by, during that time after he filed the complaint, but nothing had happened, he had gone back to Saudi Arabia, as I’m sure many of his colleagues had, and then he came back to the United States for training. Then he got a 9 mm pistol and shot up students in the basic training course classroom.
Davis: Should this be considered an act of terrorism?
Stimson: It should if the facts show that there was a connection to terrorism, and right now, the facts don’t show that. What the facts show is that a person who is a Saudi got a gun and killed people and he was killed as a result of it by the Escambia police department or somebody in law enforcement.
 … The allegations are that he had written some things on social media which were anti-American. That doesn’t necessarily mean it’s connected to terrorism. 
There’s also an allegation that he had said something positive about Osama bin Laden. I can’t imagine anything positive anyone would want to say about that person who’s, fortunately, dead. Maybe he was motivated by some jihadi tendencies, but I think it’s really important that when we have an incident like this, No. 1, we express our condolences to the people who died. Their lives and their family’s lives will never be the same, obviously.
Secondly, it’s important not to jump to conclusions, that because he’s a foreign national and because he’s serving with our military and because he says stupid things on the internet that he’s a terrorist. We need to reserve that label for people who are terrorists, who are motivated by, directed by, inspired by other terrorists, and then who commit terrorist acts.
Now, if he is, and that’s what the facts show, then we can label this an act of terrorism. He’s a murderer and he’s a heinous, despicable individual who’s, fortunately, dead, but that’s all we know right now.
Davis: Yeah. You mentioned those victims, and the three victims actually charged the shooter, right? They weren’t running away. They were actually shot, and one of them ran out and gave critical details to the sheriff who ended up taking out the shooter. Definitely heroism on display.
Stimson: Yeah. I will tell you, as a Navy captain who still serves in the reserves, of course I’m speaking as a Heritage scholar and not on behalf of the Department of the Navy, the CO of the base down there who gave a long and very eloquent press conference was so impressive. 
He said not only the right things, that we’re going to care for our families, it’s going to take a long time, but he really exemplified the type of leadership that we should all be proud of for men and women in our uniform. He rose to the occasion. 
Obviously, it was difficult for him, but in the days and weeks to come, the FBI will work closely with the military authorities to figure out why this happened. Then the harder part, which is, is there anything that we can do to prevent something like this in the future?
Now, for example, I know people have said, “We shouldn’t have military people from other countries training with our people.” That’s just ignorant, frankly. 
We’ve been training with our allies, military officers and enlisted, for decades. We need to do that, one, because it makes us stronger when we fight in coalitions; two, because mil-to-mil relationships really matter; and three, our main adversaries, the Russians and the Chinese, don’t do that. They don’t have the type of open, welcoming type of professional military relationships that we have established with dozens of countries, and we need to continue to do that.
Davis: Does this suggest an intelligence failure in some way? Any warning signs that should have been picked up on?
Stimson: We don’t know. It could have been. But remember, for those of you who don’t serve in the military, military officers today … they don’t live on the ship, they don’t live in a plane, they don’t live on base usually. 
They live out in town, like this young man did, along with all the other young patriotic men and women who were attending flight school. They lived in apartments just like anyone else. The government’s not monitoring what you’re doing in your apartment out in town, nor should they. They don’t have the legal right to do that. 
Whether there were warning signs that we missed, it’s too early to tell, but I can be darn sure that and feel quite confident that the FBI will look into that. 
I’m quite confident that the Heritage’s former chief of staff, Mark Esper, who’s the secretary of defense, based on what he said in the Sunday talk shows, will do a thorough top-to-bottom scrub to see whether we missed anything and whether any vetting protocols that we have in place are sufficient or need to be tweaked.
Davis: Yeah. What should the FBI’s key focus in this case be?
Stimson: Why it happened, and can it be prevented from happening again?
Davis: There’s been some talk about the gun law that allowed this shooter to actually get a gun legally. There’s only a handful of circumstances where a foreign national is legally allowed to purchase a firearm on U.S. soil. The governor down in Florida, Ron DeSantis, a Republican, is saying he wants to close that loophole with a new gun law. Your thoughts on that?
Stimson: Ron DeSantis is an impressive governor. He has a very high approval rating. He happens also to have been a great Navy JAG reservist and a colleague of mine. I leave it to the governor as the head of a sovereign state to decide whether or not the state laws that would allow for this to happen happen. 
If it’s a federal issue, and I suspect it may be a federal issue, I’d have to study the proposals in place. I think we have a lot of gun laws on the books, and no amount of gun laws is going to prevent some jerk from acquiring a gun and doing horrible things to people that are innocent.
Davis: Cully, I want to leave it by doing what you mentioned earlier, which is honoring those who passed. Adam Watson, who’s the brother of one of those who deceased, posted this. He said: 
Today has been the worst day of my life. Joshua Kaleb Watson saved countless lives today with his own. After being shot multiple times, he made it outside and told the first response team where the shooter was. Those details were invaluable. We are beyond proud, but there is a hole in our hearts that can never be filled.
Cully Stimson, thanks for coming in.
Stimson: God bless that young man and his family, and let’s hope we get to the bottom of this. Thanks for having me.

"For two generations, an Arizona family has kept their jewelry business afloat. Now the Supreme Court decision South Dakota vs. Wayfair is hurting their ability to do business. (Photo: Getty Images)
Brad and Hilary Scott run a family jewelry business. They sell jewelry across state lines—and that’s become a huge liability. A recent Supreme Court says they, and other businesses, have to pay sales taxes to other states, which could potentially ruin small businesses like theirs. Daniel Davis recently spoke to them at the annual meeting of the American Legislative Exchange Council in Phoenix.

Daniel Davis: I’m joined now by Brad and Hilary Scott. They are the owners of Halstead, a wholesale jewelry company in Arizona. Thanks for your time today.
Hilary Scott: Thanks for having us.
Brad Scott: Yes, thank you.
Davis: You’ve had this small business in your family for two generations now, I understand. Forty-six years. And I understand that you’re now planning to retract some of your business activity because of a Supreme Court decision that came down last year: South Dakota v. Wayfair. 
Some of our listeners might be familiar with it, but if you can
just tell us what this decision was about what it does?
Hilary Scott: Right. This was a Supreme Court ruling instead of legislation, which is really important. In this case, they decided that states could extend multi-state sales tax collection to remote sellers in other states. 
As a company that operates across
the country and around the world, anytime we have transactions to other states,
we’re now subject to the sales tax laws of the jurisdiction where the buyer is
present. That adds a tremendous amount of complexity in terms of complying now
with 50 separate states’ revenue laws and sales tax laws in addition to what
we’ve always done historically, which was complying in our own state where we
have physical presence, and then of course with the federal government.
Davis: To take an example, if someone in Florida buys one of your products online, you then have to do the math and calculate how much sales tax to cut out of the revenue and send to Florida?
Hilary Scott: Right. This is called the sourcing issue and it’s where the sales tax is assessed. In the wake of Wayfair, sales tax is sourced to the destination, and that means whatever the shipping destination is for the transaction shipment. And so in the United States, there are currently 12,000 different sales tax jurisdictions that we need to be able to handle as a business.
Davis: Well, that seems like an impossible task.
Hilary Scott: It does seem like an impossible task and we are really struggling to handle it.
Davis: How much has this cost your business so far?
Brad Scott: Well, since we were one of the early adopters, meaning that we were live to collect sales tax in October of last year, we started very early on. To date, we have spent in excess of $162,000. The company costs in terms of hours is over 3,300 hours at this point in time. It’s an enormous drain on our resources.
As a small business with 30 people, we don’t have 3,300 hours to devote to tax collection for far-flung departments or revenue across the country. What’s even more shocking really is that in that time, we’ve only collected about $68,000 in sales tax, so we are spending $2.39 cents for every single dollar of sales tax that we collect.
Davis: Wow, that’s remarkable. Have there been layoffs so far because of this?
Brad Scott: No layoffs yet. We’ve had four people leave in the last four months. And though we desperately need to replace them, we’re not. We are downsizing, but it’s through attrition as opposed to through layoffs. 
If it does come to layoffs, as a
small business owner, that’s not a decision that we take lightly. There are a
lot of steps we can take before that. Our employees, they’re an extension of
our family in a lot of ways and layoffs [are] probably the single hardest thing
you can even consider as a small business owner.
Davis: Well, I would imagine a lot of other small business owners are in the same shoes. When you talk to them, what are they saying? How are they dealing with the compliance costs?
Hilary Scott: Well, yes, we are speaking with a lot of other small business owners around the country. There’s a wide range, honestly. Yes, a lot of businesses are struggling, but what’s most frightening, I think, is that a lot of businesses aren’t even really aware of Wayfair. That means that for the last year and a half, they’ve been accumulating back tax liabilities in many cases, or even if they have zero sales tax due, they’ve been out of compliance on registration and filings.
One of the things that’s very tricky about this ruling is that it’s been discussed in the media as an online retail issue, but states through their policymaking have legislated that economic thresholds are based on gross receipts. That means any kind of business activity, regardless of the business channel, type of product, or type of industry. 
So a lot of manufacturers,
wholesalers, and distributors are also swept into this compliance mandate, even
though they’re not online retailers at all. Again, there’s a major lack of
awareness among business owners that this applies to them.
Davis: So if we get three, five years down the line and a state government decides to come after them for all those taxes, they could be potentially out of business?
Brad Scott: Well, it’s even worse than that. Sales tax is a trust fund tax, which means that you’re holding those monies in trust for the government department that you’re collecting it for. And if they do come after a company and they assess that company for a fairly substantial amount of sales tax, if the company doesn’t have the resources, then the owner’s personal assets, their cars, their homes, their investment accounts, their retirement accounts, all become collateralized and are then accessible by the states to finish the completion of payment as they see fit.
Davis: You and your company have clearly incurred a lot of damage because of this. Have you considered suing?
Hilary Scott: Suing isn’t really an option, because if we disagree with the state’s assessment, due to the Anti-Tax Injunction Act, our only option for recourse is to sue in the state where that department of revenue is located. 
For a company like ours and
Arizona, if this is Florida for example, we would have to sue the Florida
department of revenue in the Florida state court system. That’s because of
federal law. That’s the only path to recourse. Realistically for an
organization our size, that’s no path to recourse at all. We don’t feel like a small
business has a real due process option in this situation.
Davis: I would imagine you’re looking to lawmakers to correct this, to make sure the Supreme Court decision isn’t the last word?
Brad Scott: We are. You know, Wayfair was a long-fought battle between the states and even people at the federal level. And when we first started doing or having these conversations, we were under the impression that Wayfair was going to be something that the federal government would deal with right away. They have shown a reluctance to do so. 
We’ve been in D.C. pushing for
uniformity and simplicity in the rules and regulations that these states are
allowed to apply or impose, simply because for a business of our size to remain
50-state compliant, that duty falls on the shoulders of one or two individuals
at most.
For most small businesses, we don’t have a [state and local taxes] department, and so if it’s not something that one person can manage, then there’s really no solution. 
There’s been a lot of noise about
the software available to handle this and simplify it. But in our experience,
the software is riddled with problems. We have had 36 different notifications
from states over the last 12 months from [streamlined sales tax] states that
our software provider was not doing its job, but the states don’t look at it as
a problem with the software provider. They look at it as our problem. It’s
incumbent upon us to correct for that.
Davis: This is a software that supposed to be calculating the taxes that you owe?
Brad Scott: Right.
Davis: And so it’s giving you bad calculations?
Brad Scott: We haven’t had bad numbers returned to us. The real problem comes in their filing and remittance practices. They don’t necessarily file on time or they’ll file the incorrect numbers. I don’t know about the remittance practices, but we have received a number of notifications that we are out of compliance. 
What’s really galling is that in
every single one of those cases, we were in compliance. It was failures at the
certified service provider level that led to those notifications.
Davis: Wow, that’s remarkable. Well, you’ve also noted that the American Revolution was actually fought over this exact issue of being taxed by somebody out of your own jurisdiction.
Hilary Scott: It’s a little bit of a tricky distinction. One thing to insert in the conversation here is that now that states have established economic nexus laws for sales tax, a number of states are using those same economic nexus thresholds for income tax and gross receipts tax on companies. 
Where a sales tax is technically
charged to the consumer, it is the responsibility of the business to collect
that tax on the consumer in the home state. But there’s a distinction there
with income and gross receipts taxes, because those are direct taxes on
entities outside the state’s borders on the business itself.
That is indeed what the Revolutionary War was about. It was about taxation without representation. It was about England trying to tax the colonists all the way across the ocean, even though they weren’t there, they weren’t present. Yes, that is exactly what the Revolutionary War was about. The fact that economic nexus is now applied to income tax and gross receipts tax for businesses outside a state’s borders is very concerning.
Davis: When you talk to lawmakers about this, are you encouraged by what they say and do you expect that they’ll act on this?
Brad Scott: I think the greatest challenge when speaking with lawmakers is the fact that there are very few businesses that (a) have clean hands, and (b) are able to speak up. 
As Hilary mentioned earlier, the
awareness issue is a real problem because if you’re not aware and you’re out of
compliance, then by putting your hand up, you’re effectively painting a bullseye
on your back. And so, a lot of the businesses that we’ve spoken to over the
last year who are out of compliance, while they’re in total agreement with what
we’re asking for, are terrified of making any noise whatsoever.
The sounds that they’re hearing on Capitol Hill are from the big companies that are already in compliance because they have 50-state physical presence already, and they’re saying everything is working fine, when the fact of the matter is, it’s the smaller businesses, the businesses that if you believe their rhetoric, are the backbone of the American economy that are going to be the ones that are hurt the most by this.
Hilary Scott: To add onto that, I would just say this is a very complex issue and I think you get a sense of that just in our discussion so far. We understand this in detail because we’re implementing this policy on a daily basis in a business. But when you talk about it at a high level, it sounds very feasible. It’s when you get down into the trenches of implementation where you see all of the problems really shake out. 
Communicating the complexity of
this issue and the real problems of applying this policy and practice are our
greatest challenges. We are definitely finding lawmakers at both the state and
the federal levels who are willing to listen to this and take action. I do
think we’re going to see a lot of trailer legislation in states in 2020 as they
try and address some of the unintended consequences that were not anticipated
by economic nexus laws.
Davis: Well, it’s a very, very sobering conversation, that companies like yourself are under such pressure. Thank you both for sharing, Brad and Hilary. I appreciate your time.

In the 1980s, Patricia Rucker’s family left Venezuela, planning that her father would work for a time in the U.S. “Venezuela to me was the most perfect country you could have on this earth,” Rucker recalls. “Not only beautiful weather—beautiful people, very moral, very safe, very free, never had an income tax. The Constitution of Venezuela was modeled after the U.S. Constitution.”
But the family’s plans changed, even as Venezuela fundamentally changed. “Hugo Chavez was able to win an election by making promises and sowing envy, telling folks you should have what others have, you should have whatever, the nice houses,” Rucker warns. “You should get this, you should get that.”
Now a U.S. citizen and a West Virginia state senator, Rucker is speaking out about the dangers of socialism. Read the lightly edited interview, posted below, or listen on the podcast:

Daniel Davis: We’re coming to you from the annual meeting of ALEC—that’s the American Legislative Exchange Council—this year in Phoenix, Arizona. I’m joined now by Patricia Rucker. She’s a state senator from West Virginia and the co-founder and former president of We the People of West Virginia, Jefferson County. Patricia, thanks for your time today.
Patricia Rucker: Absolutely. Thank you for inviting me.
Davis: One of the very interesting things about you is that you were born in Venezuela and your family immigrated here, I believe in the early ’80s, is that right?
Rucker: That’s correct, 1981. We came here because of my father’s work. We came here legally. He had a work visa, but we always planned on returning to Venezuela. 
Venezuela to me was the most perfect country you could have on this earth. Not only beautiful weather, beautiful people, very moral, very safe, very free, never had an income tax. The Constitution of Venezuela was modeled after the U.S. Constitution and close-knit family. I mean really, I just can’t talk … I can’t tell you how beautiful it was and we always intended to go back there. 
Now I did meet my husband and that’s when I finally said, “Well, maybe I’m going to end up staying.” He’s an American and I did apply for permanent residency after I graduated from college and got married.
Having said that, just so you know … First of all, it took me over eight years to become a citizen. That’s how long and complicated it took. I already had four children before I got my citizenship in 2004, but obviously a lot of folks know about what’s happened to Venezuela and I just want to briefly touch on the tragedy that it was. 
Hugo Chavez was able to win an election by making promises and sowing envy, telling folks you should have what others have, you should have whatever, the nice houses. You should get this, you should get that. 
I mention it as a cautionary tale because so many Americans believe that we could never go down the road of Venezuela or other countries and I can tell you, I never would’ve thought that would’ve happened to Venezuela either. 
Anyone who wants to see what the fruits of socialism is, all you have to do is just look at this modern day example. In 10 years, Chavez completely destroyed that freedom and that heritage Venezuelans had been enjoying since essentially 1823, I believe.
Davis: Wow. You still remember living there before you moved here?
Rucker: Oh, yes, absolutely. Of course, we went back every other summer while we were growing up because, again, my dad was here for work. They paid for us to go back every other summer and be in Venezuela and almost all my relatives continue to live in Venezuela.
Davis: Wow. … The erosion of freedom and the socialism that came to … is that a big reason why your family didn’t go back?
Rucker: Yes, it is actually the main reason. My parents were always planning on retiring to Venezuela. They kept their home all of this time in Venezuela. Kept it up and everything else. 
One of the things that Chavez did within the first year and a half of his presidency was declared that if you weren’t physically living in your home, it meant you didn’t need it. Anyone who wanted to break into a home that was empty, the government would protect the right to stay there. Again, people don’t understand those type of real-life experiences with socialism and how it works. 
Another thing that Chavez did that of course hurt the ability for my parents to retire is he nationalized almost everybody’s savings or businesses. [He] made it really difficult for you to retire because you would lose your money. My parents, only in 2014 or ’15 did they finally give up on their dream of returning to Venezuela and applied for citizenship.
Davis: Wow. You mentioned breaking into homes. Did that happen to your parents’ house?
Rucker: Yes and to my grandparents’ house, because my grandparents died and the family wasn’t exactly sure what they were going to do with the apartment, but in the meantime, the apartment was broken into and stolen.
Davis: And there was no legal recourse? No way to sue anybody?
Rucker: Think about it. If the police are told you are to protect the squatter who breaks into your home, who are you going to go to? … 
Again, another thing that most people do not understand, we take it for granted here, that the police are going to be law abiding and follow the law. The culture in South America, I think in general, not just in Venezuela, is yes, obviously, the police … [are] supposed to enforce the law, but there’s a lot of corruption. It’s very often in a lot of countries you have to pay them to make sure that they do what you’re asking them to do. 
In Venezuela, it became so much worse under Chavez. He did not care to end that kind of corruption and it became where if you wanted to have any protection, you better have the money to pay for it.
Davis: Of course things have just gotten so much worse in the last few years.
Rucker: It is no man’s land at this point and because [Venezuelan dictator Nicolas] Maduro knows that he can’t trust Venezuelans to support him, he has hired Cuban nationals to be the military, to be the protection. 
Do you think that these Cubans, who are the ones that have the guns, are going to care that much about Venezuelans who are not happy, don’t feel the election was secure, all of these concerns? No, they’re not really on the people’s side. 
Essentially, I have to say we’ve been taken over by [a] foreign country. It’s not Venezuela anymore. It is Cuba who has taken over Venezuela and uses it for whatever their purposes and whatever they want and there is no way to peacefully end that when the Venezuela citizens do not have arms, do not have any way to fight back.
Davis: Do you have relatives that are still there?
Rucker: Yes, most of them.
Davis: Do you keep in touch with them?
Rucker: We do, the ones who have access to electronic forms of communication. Facebook, WhatsApp, that kind of thing, we use [them] to talk to them. 
I will tell you, most of them are so terrified of their conversations being seen by the government that we usually cannot get real details on the truth of how bad things are. They tend to gloss over it and kind of hint at it. Only when somebody is able to escape do we really hear about the truth of how bad it is.
Davis: Wow. That’s remarkable. It’s almost like hearing from somebody behind the Iron Curtain back 40 years ago, but it’s happening right now.
Rucker: It is. It is just like that. I mean, [it’s] unbelievable … how scared they are of being spied upon.
Davis: Wow. Well, you’re someone who has really lived the American dream. You moved here when you were just a child and became a teacher, but after, what was it, 20 years, you decided to homeschool your children. Tell me about that process and why you made that shift.
Rucker: Sure. Just to let everybody know, I was a product of public school education and loved it and had a wonderful public school education here in the United States of America. 
When I was 11, I said, “This is what I want to do, I want to teach.” I [had a] single-minded focus, “I want to teach social studies in public schools.” And when I graduated I did that for about a year and a half or so, but I became pregnant with my firstborn and the minute they laid her in my arms, I knew I couldn’t go back to the classroom. She was my priority. I ended up having five children and when … it was time for [my oldest] to go to kindergarten, she was diagnosed [with] autism spectrum disorder.
Around 2005 or so was around the time she was starting school. The public schools really did not have a handle on how to handle autism students and they wanted to put her in a special ed inclusive classroom with very severe special ed needs and she really didn’t need that kind of help. 
I ended up deciding to homeschool her and I fell in love with it. I got a chance to teach, and not just social studies, but everything. That’s why [for] 15 years I basically homeschooled my children and had a wonderful experience doing so, even though that had never been in the original plan.
Davis: When you made that shift, did you take that on by yourself or were there resources at the time? I know … it’s becoming a lot more common just in the last 10, 15 years, but—
Rucker: It sure has. When I started there wasn’t quite as much support as there is now, but definitely the pioneers had already set the stage and there were some curriculums out there accessible for us to use and I definitely did find support. 
Where I live in West Virginia, unfortunately, the education is not as well as most people would like and there is a very strong homeschooling community in Jefferson County, West Virginia.
Davis: Wow. [You’re homeschooling five kids] and you decided to run for the state Senate. You were elected in 2016. What inspired you to run for office?
Rucker: Well, I will admit that a lot of it had to do with what happened to Venezuela. Chavez got elected in 2000. By 2008, Venezuela was already pretty much lost and I did not want to see my newly adopted country, remember I became a citizen 2004, … going down that same path. 
Some of the things that were said by the presidential candidate running in 2008 really concerned me. I was one of those folks that got involved. 
Of course, you know about the tea party movement and We The People of Jefferson County was the tea party that got created in my county. And yes, I was the founder of it, but it was out of a deep desire to really stand up for what made America great, which is our Constitution and our rights. It really concerns me that there are so many people willing to accept promises made and lose the freedom for those promises.
I’ve been doing the job always of trying to educate others and deciding to run for office was an extension of that. I had already started going door to doors, founder of the tea party movement. I had gotten involved in elections to get good candidates elected who would protect those rights. 
It came to a point that my own representative was someone who nobody wanted to run against. We were able to recruit folks, good folks, that we could support in all these different races but not in mine. Very reluctantly, I put my name in and the first time I ran I lost by 110 votes, but I ran again and this time for the Senate and I won by over 5,000.
Davis: Wow. How about that, 5,000 votes. You’re the chair now of the Education Committee in the state Senate. Obviously, as a teacher, I would assume you bring a lot of experience to that. How has your previous life as a teacher informed what you do now?
Rucker: … I will tell you that it’s almost held against me that I homeschooled. It completely discounts me as having any input because I homeschooled.
They don’t count homeschooling as being an educator of any kind. I will tell you though, I did experience a really good public school education. I felt that was excellent. I really want to see that for every student. I want everyone to be able to say, just like I can say, “I had a wonderful public education experience.” 
My goal has been to take away the hurdles that are stopping teachers from being able to teach and bring more local control into West Virginia because it is a very centralized educational system.
I will say, I do support educational choice. For those parents who can’t get what they need, like I couldn’t for my oldest child, I want to make sure they have whatever they need, that that child be educated. 
I will tell you that as a homeschooling parent, not every parent can homeschool. Both for financial reasons or other reasons. If their child is somehow not getting the education they need in the traditional public school, our priority as a state and as a people is to make certain that child gets what they need. That should be what is most important. 
If it means a private school, if it means a public charter school, if it means giving them enough funds to get outside support or tutorials, I’m in favor of as many options as possible because I believe parents are the ones who can best know what their child needs. I do not ever want to tell a parent who cannot afford something their child needs, “Too bad.”
I just can’t imagine that and it’s hard for me to believe that there are those who say, “No. Absolutely, the tax dollars should only be in public education.” 
Well, you know how hard it is to be a public school teacher, where you have 25, 30 students and each of those students is unique and has different strengths and weaknesses? As a public school teacher you have to try to help everybody, which generally means you teach to the middle. That means there are kids on both sides of the spectrum that are not getting what they need. Giving more choices is not anti-public school. It is trying to make certain that we help everyone.
Davis: Wow. Well, last year there was a major teachers’ strike in West Virginia, which you must’ve been right in the middle of that controversy, being on the Education Committee. What was that like?
Rucker: I will confess that it was because of my education reform bill that the teachers went on strike. 
I proposed a bill that was very comprehensive on education reform and needs. In addition to bringing more local control, it included a few changes to the funding mechanism, increasing the amount of money for nurses and counselors and psychologists for public schools. But it did include starting charter schools for the first time [in] West Virginia and legalizing it. It originally included ESAs [education savings accounts] for victims of bullying and students with special needs, in addition to other technical things that were [specific] to West Virginia. 
Well, the charter school and the ESA portion caused the teachers to go on strike. I really was driven by the unions, who were telling the teachers, “We cannot accept this under any circumstances.” Even though it was just a very small, tiny, tiny amount of funding, they went on strike and they managed to table the bill indefinitely in the House because of their strike.
Davis: It wasn’t the National Education Association lobby that was pushing this?
Rucker: Oh yes, they came to West Virginia. We had Randi Weingarten there helping support the strike and the protesting, which is funny when the national organizations, teachers unions were the originators of the charter school idea. I just find that very humorous. 
I will tell you that when they killed the bill, I mean that’s their prerogative, right? They killed the bill. Well, then they came and still wanted the teacher pay raise that the governor had promised them. 
In the Senate we were very clear when we said, “Well, we want education reform. If we’re not going to get education reform, we’re not going to pass that teacher pay raise.” That hard stance that we made caused the governor to call for a special session on education reform. After a very long extended special session, we did finally get some education reform passed in the state of West Virginia.
Davis: What kind of reforms?
Rucker: We got three charter schools and open enrollment. I don’t know if you know what that is. That allows students from a county to go to another public school, even outside of the county. And you only need permission of the school that’s accepting you, not permission of the school that you’re leaving. We also got some of the other things we wanted to do, like local control.
Davis: What are some of the things that you’re looking to push in the next year or so?
Rucker: Well, … it’s an election year. It’s always harder to do anything controversial in an election year, but we still have a lot of things that we still want to get to teachers. 
Even though we were able to fund more counselors and psychologists and nurses for the schools, we still don’t have enough funding for one nurse in every single school. We’d love to see if we could reach that goal. I think that’s important. 
Then there’s other things that we could do that won’t necessarily cost money, but just more accountability, clarifying what it is that we expect our graduates to have. 
There’s been a lot of discussion here at ALEC about civics education and I’ll be honest, I haven’t looked, and considering I’m a history major and was a history teacher, you would’ve thought I would have looked into that, but I haven’t looked to see what it is that we require. There’s lots of ways we can still continue to work on this.
Davis: Fantastic. We’ll have to leave it there, unfortunately, but Patricia, thank you so much for your time today.
Rucker: No problem. Thank you for having me.

"""If you're reducing your Christian identity to identity and not practicing the faith, then you're not going to pass it down and the church itself is not going to survive over the long haul,"" says Ross Douthat. (Photo: Getty Images)
Amid declining church attendance, and cultural storms, do Americans still take faith seriously?  “We’re a no longer deeply Christian country that is not yet post-Christian and is still heavily influenced by Christianity,” says Ross Douthat, a New York Times columnist and author.

Daniel Davis: I’m joined now by Ross Douthat. He is a New York Times columnist and author of the forthcoming book “The Decadent Society: How We Became the Victims of Our Own Success.” Ross, it’s great to have you in the studio.
Ross Douthat: It’s great to be here. Thanks for having me.
Davis: So Ross, we’ve been told that in America in the 21st century, we live in a post-Christian society [and] that things are only going to get more secular. And yet, in so many ways, Christianity almost has a zombie-like existence in our culture, even in the secular parts of the culture, where not just institutional Christianity but Christian concepts continue to inhabit our minds. How would you describe the state of Christianity in America, the role it’s playing, and the relative grip that it still has on us?
Douthat: I think one way to look at it is that on the one hand, there is a resilient core in American life of actual Christian practice and belief, right? Of people going to church on Sundays and identifying as Roman Catholics or Reformed Presbyterians and so on. And that core is somewhat smaller than it used to be, but it’s collapsed, [that] might be somewhat overstated. It’s still there. It’s still real. It still matters. 
Then you have sort of two other zones of spiritual attitudes, both of which are more post-Christian, but are, as you say, still heavily influenced by Christian ideas.
And one is this sort of the kind of spiritual zone, which is a zone where people no longer believe in the absolute authority of Scripture or the authority of the Catholic Church’s Magisterium, but they’re still likely to believe in supernatural and metaphysical concepts that are—not always, but often—connected to Christianity. 
This is sort of the zone that runs from Joel Osteen on the right to Oprah Winfrey on the left, if you wanted to. And it folds in a lot of people who identify as Christian, but maybe are in some prosperity gospel zone that is a little bit unorthodox, shall we say, and people who don’t per se identify as Christians but would identify with Christian traditions and ideas to some extent—that’s more the Oprah zone.
Then you have a zone that thinks of itself as secular, this is the world of the intelligentsia, the Academy, perhaps some readers of my own newspaper. 
That zone doesn’t usually have Christian metaphysical concepts in the sense or it doesn’t have supernatural concepts. It’s unlikely to believe in angels, miracles, divine revelation, and so on. But it does still have a Christian moral framework in a lot of cases, a vision of the inviability of the individual, apart from the abortion debate, “Thou shalt not kill.” Right?
And a lot of progressive attitudes around human rights, especially, I think, still manifest a strong Christian influence and you can even see it sort of in what we think of as woke culture. The rituals of confessing your privilege and being ashamed of your associations with past sins, all of that, without being Christian, still participates in the Christian tradition in certain interesting ways. 
So, I don’t think it’s correct to call us [a post-Christian society]. We’re a no longer deeply Christian country that is not yet post-Christian and is still heavily influenced by Christianity, [that’s] how I’d put it.
Davis: Yeah. That picture you paint is very residual and it points to a past where some of these institutions and ideas were much more shored up. Can you give us the broad strokes of say the last 60 to 70 years, how we got to where we are now from say the post-World War II consensus?
Douthat: Right. … The first thing to be said is that a lot of these quasi-Christian or semi-Christian trends are not … entirely new. Right? I mean, America has always been a nation of heretics, to use a phrase I used in one of my books, it’s always been a place with a lot of spiritual freelancers. 
The American intelligentsia has been pretty secular for a long time. There have always been figures like Oprah Winfrey, let’s put it that way. Right? That said, there has been a shift where 60 or 70 years ago, there was a lot of clear institutional vitality and convergence between different institutional forms of Christian faith.
And you know, I use the example—because it’s relevant right now, because he’s about to be beatified—of Fulton Sheen, who was a Catholic bishop who had a Oprah-esque or Dr. Phil-esque prime-time show or maybe Jordan Peterson-esque, to pick a different figure, where he delivered a kind of moral and philosophical self-help to Americans of all faiths that was clearly rooted in a very strong institutional Catholicism and a strong Catholic framework. And of course, he wore the full bishop’s regalia while he did it.
And a figure like Sheen or a figure like Billy Graham or a figure like Reinhold Niebuhr, even a figure like Martin Luther King, all represent strong forms of religious influence that come out of strong institutional traditions—mainline Protestantism for Niebuhr, the black church for King, and evangelicalism for Graham. 
And some of that is what we’ve lost, I think, over the 50 or 60 years since. That … there are very few figures who are directly associated with a mainline church or an important evangelical body, or even Roman Catholicism, who have nonsectarian and apolitical influence.
You have figures who have influence as conservative Christians, right? Like Franklin Graham has influence, but he’s seen as a sectarian and partisan figure in a way that his father was not. And similarly, Catholic bishops are  always caught up in the Catholic churches post-’60s Civil War, where you’ll have Catholic bishops who are seen as liberal Catholics, and Catholic bishops who are seen as conservative Catholics, but very few who successfully speak to their own church as a whole, let alone the culture as a whole.
So I think it’s that decline of strong institutions and strong nonpartisan figures associated with them that’s the big shift since the ’50s.
Davis: And of course we couldn’t have this conversation without noting the sexual revolution that came after the ’50s. What effect do you see the sexual revolution is having on the church itself?
Douthat: I mean, I think the best way to understand it is to say that before the sexual revolution, if you weren’t a zealous, pious Christian, the basic Christian ideas about sex and marriage and sexual morality still seem to make a kind of basic sense, right? 
So the idea that maybe you didn’t think sex before marriage was a mortal sin, but you accepted the social conventions that if you did have sex before marriage, it should be premarital sex in the literal sense, where you’re having sex with someone you’re likely to get married to. Or, you know, that divorce might be necessary, but it should be an extreme last situation. Or, you know, living together outside of marriage is socially unacceptable, even if it’s not going to send you to hell.
And that’s what shifts in the course of the sexual revolution, that … conventional, middle-class morality stops thinking of Christianity, a Christian morality, New Testament sexual ethics as generally good wisdom, and starts thinking of it either as an ideal that people can’t live up to or as a patriarchal, misogynist, homophobic burden that we’re better off without. 
And I think it’s affected the Christian churches by basically dividing them internally between factions that think … the churches need to adapt to this new reality by dramatically shifting or evolving Christian sexual ethics, and factions that think, “No, you need to maintain tradition, maintain the traditional teaching, stay true to the words of Jesus and St. Paul, and eventually the culture can be reconverted or come back.”
 … It’s not the only point of division within Christian churches, but it’s clearly one of the biggest ones. And it just … didn’t exist, anything like the same extent in the late 19th century, early 20th century. Not that these debates weren’t there, they were, but they just became much, much sharper. And neither the conservative approach nor the liberal approach has necessarily worked in the sense of building a recovered Christianity for a post-sexual revolution age.
Davis: Would you say that one of those approaches has worked in the sense of maintaining just internal integrity? I mean, you do, so if you—
Douthat: I mean, look, I’m a conservative, right? I identify, I guess, as a conservative Catholic. So I think the conservative approach has generally more moral and theological integrity—not, I think, on every issue and every argument, but generally so. And I think that sociologically, it’s been somewhat more successful at giving people a reason to remain in the pews and present a persuasive, coherent Christianity. 
I think that the amount of creative editing of both church tradition and Scripture that you have to do to get to a fully liberalized Christianity—as Nadia Bolz-Weber, right, to pick a current liberal Protestant writer, who basically says the church needs to adapt completely to the sexual revolution—I think to get there, the editing required makes the larger Christian gospel and witness seem much more implausible. 
But it does have to be said that the conservative approach has not reclaimed the culture. It can build a bunker mentality where people are  hunkered down and saying, “We’re going to … defend my family against the culture.” But that doesn’t mean you have any idea of how to do missionary work. And a bunker mentality can breed a toxic and hermetic environment.
 … I want to be cautious of the demographic triumphalism that conservative Christians sometimes get into where they say, “Well, our churches are still here, and the liberal churches have vanished.” Because that’s not always the case, right? I mean, Roman Catholicism has declined pretty steeply, even though Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI were trying to hold the line on these issues. So, there isn’t a perfect correlation between conservatism and robustness on every front.
Davis: Right? I mean, even in my own evangelical tradition, the term evangelical, because it’s been so politicized, it’s become more of a political identifier. People respond to surveys and say, “Oh yeah, I’m an evangelical,” just because they live in a white or rural or conservative region of the country. But that doesn’t necessarily map onto their worldview.
Douthat: Right? I mean, there’s a zone of residual cultural Christianity on the American right that is not practically practicing the faith. And this is sort of the conservative equivalent of Christmas-and-Easter liberal Christians, right? It’s people who—when Donald Trump or before him, people on Fox News talked about like how there’s a war on Christmas, right? There’s a certain kind of American who doesn’t go to church but wants to say “Merry Christmas,” right? I mean, I don’t want to be reductive, but that’s a real phenomenon.
 … As a Christian, you want to say in certain ways that any residual form of Christianity is worth nurturing. And the impulse to say “Merry Christmas” is a Christian impulse and it’s worth nurturing. But if you’re reducing your Christian identity to identity and not practicing the faith, then you’re not going to pass it down and the church itself is not going to survive over the long haul.
Davis: And you mentioned some key names from the ’50s, Reinhold Niebuhr, Fulton Sheen. And then you mentioned Martin Luther King. You could speak of a religious center in America in that era, who is the religious center of America today?
Douthat: I mean, I think it is figures who are  supernaturalist in the sense that they believe that prayer, divine intervention, miracles, all of these things are possible, but fundamentally, individualist in their religious outlook. 
And so, it’s sort of you’re accepting that God is real and that life has purpose and the universe has meaning and prayer works, but you’re not submitting yourself to the authority of Ccripture or the Magisterium of the Catholic Church or any kind of traditional religious authority.
I mentioned both Joel Osteen and Oprah Winfrey earlier in this conversation. I tend to think of the American religious center in the ’50s as being somewhere between Fulton Sheen and Billy Graham and the American religious center today being somewhere between Joel Osteen and Oprah Winfrey, which means, again, … Osteen describes himself as a Christian. It’s not a post-Christian religious center, but it’s much more individualist and much less institutionalist and therefore much less orthodox by any definition than it was a few generations back.
Davis: So looking from our present toward the future, what are some possible trajectories you see happening? I mean, I think a lot of us were very surprised to see Kanye West come forward as a born-again Christian, and then go up and speak with Joel Osteen and that whole thing and are watching closely to see what happens next.
Douthat: Right.
Davis: … I, with enthusiasm and hope, look at this and think, “Oh, he is very influential. [He] could bring new people to hear the message of the gospel and of the faith and that could be a means.” So, I mean, history is so unpredictable like that. What are some of the future trajectories you see?
Douthat: Right. So one possibility is that this is actually kind of self-stabilizing, right? And you mentioned that my next book is about decadence, and this is the decadence argument … [where] you have a situation where institutional religion has declined but it never gets weak enough to fall apart entirely. And it remains, what you said, a zombie, a sort of zombie Christianity, right? That you can stay in this kind of zombie state for a long time with a core of religious believers keeping the churches going, enough Christian influence in the culture that you don’t get massive new religious transformations … like mass conversion to Buddhism or Islam or something.
But things stay much as they are—that we’re a rich society, that religious individualism works for a rich society, a society where people are pretty comfortable and don’t want priests or … biblical literalists telling them what to do. 
So I think that’s possible, right? That actually, that … we could have gone through this transformation that started in the ’60s and have reached a kind of stable decadent zombie point.
But as you say, history is unpredictable, right? And the reality is that one, there’s a lot of, I think, religious impulses that are unfulfilled in the current landscape. I think religious individualism doesn’t fulfill impulses toward community and solidarity and it doesn’t necessarily work for people when things go really bad. 
And secularism, this secular world picture with its residual Christian moralism, can’t really explain where that moralism comes from because it doesn’t believe that God created the universe or that human beings are beings independent of their bodies. 
So there are those points of tension that could be points of fracture and points of change.
And then, if you look at just Western religious history alone, you can’t predict individual figures. You can’t predict a Martin Luther, a John Calvin, you can’t predict a Francis of Assisi or Thomas Aquinas. You can’t predict Jesus of Nazareth. You can’t predict the Prophet Muhammad, right? 
Nobody in the year 550 AD would have said, “Well, obviously, the next religious thing is a monotheistic religion that claims to be the heir to Christianity and Judaism that comes surging out of the Arabian Desert.” No one would’ve predicted that.
So, I mean, Kanye—you know, Bob Dylan had a Christian phase. I think with artists and celebrities, you want to be simultaneously supportive of their conversions without putting too much hope and weight into it. But it’s certainly an example of how the unexpected rules religious life. And the reason that religion is resilient in a secular age isn’t just that there’s  a general predisposition toward religious belief, but also because people just keep on having religious experiences and that has an effect on the culture whether we like it or not.
Davis: Yeah. Well, that sort of gets to the secularization thesis that I want to ask you about. You mentioned Islam and that’s a factor that is  disrupting the secularization thesis in Europe where secularism really did triumph for a long time and now you’ve got Islam coming in through immigration and filling a kind of spiritual vacuum. In America, we don’t have that so much, but America’s always been the exception to the rule of secularization. Given those contexts, do you think secularism really has a viable long-term future?
Douthat: … I think hard secularism is a little bit overstated even in the European context, right? … The sort of secularism that is represented by a Richard Dawkins, right? A sort of real atheism is actually pretty rare. Even in Sweden or England or in sort of Northern European countries where church-going has fallen off a cliff. 
I think what triumphed in Europe was much more really the kind of religious individualism that I was talking about earlier that was a little bit more secularized in the European context because Europe didn’t have this tradition of religious entrepreneurship and startup churches and so on.
But as for, I think, religious individualism though, I think that it has the capacity to last as long as wealth and stability last in a sense. And I think if you look at, whether it’s Muslims in Europe or Mormons and Orthodox Jews and the Amish in the U.S. and so on, I think you often see religious communities that thrive within secularism and people have a lot of kids and they grow rapidly at the beginning. But then, there’s also a lot of attrition because it’s hard to practice a faith intensely in a context of general disbelief. And it’s harder in the context, again, of wealth and stability and pleasure-seeking, right?
That sort of hedonism really is attractive to people. … Even like getting up on Sunday and going to church, having kids and raising them, nothing made me more sympathetic to the life of the secular European then having kids because I realized, “This is really hard.” Right? And you can see why, given the choice, people might not. And the same is true of intense religious practice, which, frankly, I’m not very good at myself. 
So I don’t think that religious people should look at the real weaknesses of secularism and assume, “Oh, it’s going to collapse and we’ll have a Muslim Europe and a church of Kanye America tomorrow.”
I think there is, up until the point when the whole system seems to be in crisis, there’s likely to be a certain resilience to a certain kind of secularism. Again, not militant atheism, but a softer kind.
Davis: When you look at political divisions within the church, particularly along racial and ethnic lines, you see two parties in America that have lots of Christians in them. Well, I think [the] Democratic Party is very secular, but has a large base of Christians. Do you think that political split within the church has weakened the church’s ability to have an impact on society at large?
Douthat: Oh yeah, absolutely. I mean, I think one of the big shifts from the ’50s to the present is just political polarization is more powerful and people put more of their identity into their political party and less into their religion, right? People used to—the Catholics wouldn’t want their daughters to marry Lutherans and vice versa, and now that’s a lot weaker. But it’s Republicans don’t want their daughters to marry liberals and Democrats don’t want their sons to marry conservatives. And that, yeah. 
Any time when political identity becomes more important than religious identity, the church is going to be in a lot of trouble and it contributes to this sense that if you wanted to be a Billy Graham or a Reinhold Niebuhr or Fulton Sheen, you wouldn’t have a place to stand that was seen as not liberal first and conservative second, conservative first and liberal second.
The racial polarization is, on the one hand, in certain ways, it’s a deeper scandal in the sense that it’s connected to America’s original sin and slavery and everything else, right? Which has created, I think, very historically understandable reasons that African American churchgoers don’t feel comfortable in a party dominated by Southern white evangelicals, even though they have a lot in common theologically.
The only thing that might be said about that that’s more positive is that on the one hand, a political reconciliation between black and white Christians is obviously desirable. On the other hand, it might be good for America that there are reasons why there’s still a strong religious presence in one of our political parties that’s otherwise secularizing and actually American politics might become much more toxic if it was purely, you know, all the religious people are in one party and all the secular people or all the non, you know, all this spiritual mushy middle people are in the other.
So, I mean, there are ways in which the secularization of the Democratic Party is constrained by racial division and the racial division is bad. But I don’t necessarily want a world where there aren’t any churchgoers in the Democratic Party anymore.
Davis: Well, I’m afraid we’ll have to leave it there. But you mentioned a book that you had written, it’s “Bad Religion.”
Douthat: Yeah. If listeners are interested in more of these thoughts, they can read my 2012 book “Bad Religion: How We Became a Nation of Heretics,” which some of it needs to be updated probably, but a lot of it is still relevant.
Davis: I am waiting for the second edition right now. Ross, thanks for your time.
Douthat: Absolutely. Thanks for having me.

Daniel Davis: I’m joined now by Congressman Jody Hice. He represents Georgia’s 10th Congressional District. He sits on the Oversight and Reform Committee and is a member of the House Freedom Caucus, and notably he is host of the “Freedom Caucus Podcast.” Thanks for your time, Congressman.
Rep. Jody Hice: Great to be here with you. Thanks for having me.
Davis: So this week we got the long-awaited inspector general report about the origins of the FBI’s surveillance on the Trump campaign and how that came about. The report says there was no direct evidence of political bias on the FBI’s part, just a ton of incompetence, lots of errors and mistakes and omissions in their applications to the FISA [Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act] court to get their warrant. Based on your reading of the facts, what do you make of that conclusion?
Hice: Yeah. I would disagree with that conclusion. You don’t have to go very far to see that this was much more than incompetence. There was an effort to go after the president and, fortunately, we have another investigation going on with Attorney General [William] Barr and [U.S. Attorney John] Durham. 
And of course they immediately came out themselves challenging those conclusions and their investigation is much broader, much deeper. They have much more information to draw from. And it was as though they were responding with a, “Not so fast here, we have more information. We’ve got the goods. We know that there was indeed an attempt out of bias to destroy the president and to go after him.” And I think that’s going to come out when their investigation concludes. 
But I think … the report itself was fine. I do disagree with some of the conclusions, but this ought to send chills down the spine of every American. When you think that the FBI literally was weaponized to spy on American citizens, that is a chilling reality that took place. And we have got to get to the bottom of this, and I think at the end of the day, particularly when Barr’s investigation is over, we will get to the bottom of this.
Davis: Yeah. One of the big questions that I had looking over this is, if the FBI thought that Russia was trying to bait the Trump campaign and they wanted to stop that, why not just talk to the Trump campaign and say, “Hey, they’re trying to bait you, you need to watch out.”? Instead, they launched a secret surveillance investigation.
Hice: Yeah, and the reason they were launching a secret investigation, in my opinion, is because it was the DNC [Democratic National Committee] and Hillary Clinton that [were] paying for this thing. I mean, … the false dossier … you start connecting the dots of this thing and you see that it is very broad. It’s very deep state, if you will, heavily involved in this whole process, and the president really was victim in this. 
And it is revealed, exposed, I believe, even in what [Justice Department Inspector General Michael] Horowitz has come out with to this point that yes, there was the whole FISA warrant—at least 17 major significant errors and omissions involved in putting together a false document in order to get a FISA warrant. Thereby to begin spying on the president and his campaign. 
That is a frightful reality that took place in the United States. And behind it all, it is being funded by Democrats and high-ranking individuals within the Democratic Party. And so I think when this comes out further with the investigation that Barr is doing, we’re going to see some extremely disturbing realities and some facts when that report comes out.
Davis: Yeah. William Barr, the attorney general, says he … wants to take steps to make sure this kind of thing doesn’t happen again. And that must be the big concern, right? Because there already was protocol in place.
Hice: That’s right.
Davis: So what do you do?
Hice: Well, what you do is you make people pay who have broken the law and they’ve broken the trust of the American people, individuals who have been involved in this … 
One of the biggest questions I have back home in the 10th District of Georgia is, “When are heads going to roll over all this corruption?” 
People want to know. People want justice. People want to believe that Lady Justice is still blindfolded, that it does not matter if you have a “D” in front of your name or not, that if you break the law, if you violate the trust of the American people in this deep kind of way that apparently has taken place here, that there are going to be consequences and you’re not going to be protected or find cover just because you have a “D” in front of your name in this instance. 
And so yeah, I think William Barr is coming out with the statement already. He’s setting the pathway, he’s setting the standard that heads are going to roll and that’s how you prevent this type of thing from happening in the future.
Davis: Well, this week, House Democrats have put forward two articles of impeachment against President Trump and they’re saying that they have to impeach him now because he clearly cheated in the first election and the second one is coming up. So, you’ve got to prevent that from happening. What’s your response?
Hice: Yeah. I mean, they were doing this before he ever even took office. … As a candidate, the day after he was inaugurated, they were talking about impeaching him. And it’s stunning to me that they were talking about impeachment before the phone call with the Ukrainian president ever even took place. In fact, [House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi announced that they were going to proceed with impeachment before the facts ever even came out on this thing. 
This has been a Democratic Party from Day One of this administration that has aggressively been looking for haystacks anywhere they can find it, in hopes that there’s a needle somewhere in the haystack. And they’ve just been going from one issue to another, to another, to another, trying to find anything that they can thereby come up and say, “Hey, look what we found. Now we can impeach the president and justify it.” 
And with these two articles that they’ve come up with, they’re extremely vague. They still have not declared what the president did that was an abuse of power. What did he do that obstructed Congress? It’s all vague, lame attempts to create something out of nothing. 
The only thing the Democrats do not have in this entire impeachment inquiry is evidence, and that’s a pretty big deal. When you’re talking about impeaching the president, you need evidence of crimes, treason, bribery, high crimes and misdemeanors and there is zero evidence of any of that.
Davis: What do you make of the process that’s played out and what Republicans have or haven’t been able to do?
Hice: Yeah. It’s been the most unfair thing I’ve ever seen in my life. Never would I have dreamed that this type of process would actually take place in the United States of America. We have not been given a voice. … As minority party, we have not been allowed to subpoena people. 
There have been times that [House Intelligence Committee Chairman] Adam Schiff literally stopped the witnesses from answering questions that were coming from Republicans because he was uncomfortable with where those questions may lead. 
The president has not been able to defend himself. We’ve not been able to call any witnesses that we wanted to talk with. By House rules, the minority is supposed to be given a minority hearing. To this day, we still have not been granted a hearing where we are able to subpoena people and have our own questioning of individuals. That has not taken place.
I mean, the whole thing has been an absolute sham. While we were meeting in the basement of the Capitol with the depositions that Adam Schiff was leading, we were not allowed to talk to the media, but they continually leaked specific phrases from the witnesses that they were allowed to bring forth. 
Again, we were not allowed to have any witnesses we wanted. They only brought witnesses that they thought would bring damaging reports and testimony against the president and then they leaked certain things to the press that they wanted to. If we leaked anything, we would be in trouble. 
So it’s absolutely indescribable how unjust, how partisan, how enormous of a hoax this whole thing has been. It has consisted of anything but fairness and justice.
Davis: Adam Schiff released a report about his committee’s impeachment investigation. Why do you think he hasn’t testified yet?
Hice: He needs to. He absolutely needs to. He is the architect behind this whole sham. He is the one that put it together and hopefully he will be required to provide testimony under oath if this goes on to the Senate. Hopefully his day of reckoning will come. 
But just for an example, when all of this started, it was Adam Schiff who basically was saying the whistleblower was … You would think the whistleblower was the most important person in the world at that time, and we have information, we have found a needle so to speak, and Adam Schiff was touting, and Nancy Pelosi, this whistleblower was going to testify in the very near future. Then it became known that Adam Schiff and his staff and/or his staff had been coordinating with the whistleblower on this whole thing.
In fact, the whistleblower was not even a whistleblower until after he or she met with Schiff and his staff and they convinced that individual to come forward as a whistleblower. 
Once that information became known, then all of a sudden Adam Schiff did not want that whistleblower to testify and he started going to individuals who [had], again, hearsay, second-, third-, fourth-hand information. Many of the witnesses who came forward had zero information whatsoever. No fat witnesses have been brought forth from this whole thing. 
And you and I, [we] cannot get a speeding ticket on second-hand information, but this whole process has been, “We’re going to impeach the president on ‘He said, she said that they heard someone thought this, that, and it.'” It is absolute insanity what the Democrats are dragging the American people through.
Davis: Are you concerned that this could create a “cry wolf” effect where you impeach the president, we impeached in the ’90s, now we we’re impeaching President Trump? Eventually, the American people might just think, “Oh impeachment, that’s a partisan thing.”
Hice: Well, that’s certainly what it is now. And that is part of the risk that we are facing with impeachment. Impeachment is supposed to be for serious high crimes and misdemeanors and there is none of that involved here. 
In fact, already, Democrats are saying that if this impeachment fails, they are going to turn around and impeach him again. And it just goes back to their attempt to impeach him the day after he was inaugurated, before he had ever had an opportunity to do anything wrong. … 
And listen, just because you don’t like a president, that’s fine, but that is not an impeachable offense. The Democrats here are trying to impeach someone they don’t like and they don’t like his policies. They are fearful he is going to be reelected, and so they’re only out is to try to impeach him and they’re doing anything they can. So yeah, I think this sets an extremely dangerous precedent for the whole impeachment process for future administrations.
Davis: Well, shifting to something that Congress has more traditionally focused on, and that’s spending. It is December, which means you and your colleagues are going to be voting on a bunch of spending measures or depending how it shakes out, one big spending measure. We’ll see. 
So House Democrats are packing these bills with lots of progressive items that I would imagine are just going to get taken out in the Senate. Do you think they’re going to be successful?
Hice: Yeah. I hope they will. You say there’s going to be a bunch of spending measures, whether it’s a bunch of measures or one big measure. What we do know, it’s a bunch of spending and a bunch of unnecessary spending. And yeah, hopefully the Senate will help us get rid of a lot of the stuff, but look, this is another example of the lack of ability. In fact, the absolute inability of the Democrats to legislate and to lead. 
We have had spending issues. We have known for the entire year that the government was going to run out of money on the 20th. They did nothing all year long. They were focused on impeachment. Same is true with funding our military and we have a host of other issues … lowering drug prices, for example, USMCA [United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement], all these things all year long, the Democrats have done absolutely nothing.
And when the president tags them as the “Do-Nothing Dems,” he is spot on. They have done absolutely nothing. 
Now we come to the end of the year and we have spending measures that need to be passed. We have funding the military … needs to be passed and there is no telling what kind of garbage is going to be placed in those spending bills. 
But again, we are going to be coming back right before Christmas having battles when everyone’s wanting to be home with their families for Christmas. And the Democrats are hopeful that during that pressure that people will cave and just pass whatever they put on the table. And I can tell you, there’s a bunch of us who that is not going to be enough. We’re going to be fighting tooth and nail to limit … the size and scope and spending of government.
Davis: Well, we tend to see more and more short-term continuing resolution bills instead of these yearlong appropriations bills, and that’s become really a pattern in the last five, 10 years in Congress. How did we get there and what’s the problem in Congress that’s keeping Congress from actually passing long-term bills?
Hice: You’ve got appropriators who, I mean, they have struggled. Everything has become so partisan. We are living in an environment where partisanship is the rule of the day. And so it becomes increasingly difficult to find agreement on these massive spending bills when it’s so intensely charged with partisan politics. And that becomes even more of an issue in the Senate, but that is driving all of this. 
So … it becomes as partisan as it is absent the best interest of the United States, but more the best interest of our partisan party politics. Then what gets put into these bills is all sorts of measures that are advancing political agendas rather than advancing that which is in the best interest of the United States as a whole.
And so you have, for example, in an NDAA [National Defense Authorization Act] bill—a spending bill to fund our military—we now have in a military funding bill a measure that’s going to give parental leave and all this sort of stuff to every federal employee, right? So that’s partisan. If we’re going to deal with a military spending bill, then let’s deal with just military issues. 
But that’s what happens when everything becomes partisan party-driven. All these spending measures start getting heaped with partisan party agenda, political agenda measures that are placed in them and that becomes poison pills for a number of people and shuts the process down.
Davis: Would you say that House leadership has too much control over the legislative process, that the committees that you’re on need to have more power?
Hice: Absolutely. Yeah. And that’s where a lot of the problem is as well. … we have committees that are assigned the responsibility to do different things, whatever it was within the jurisdiction of X, Y, Z committee. And those committees need to be given the authority to do their work and to submit that work to the Congress as a whole for a vote. Instead, leadership more often than not dictates what is going to be done even within committee work. 
And so yeah, … that in itself becomes a very partisan issue because leadership of whatever party is in control too often, is dictating everything that’s taking place, even in committee work.
Davis: All right. Well, we’ll see what happens with the spending bills and of course impeachment and everything else. Congressman Jody Hice, I want to plug your podcast one more time because our listeners should check it out. It’s the “Freedom Caucus Podcast.” Congressman, thank you for your time.
Hice: Well, thank you. And let me just say the “Freedom Caucus Podcast” is all about bringing back information, inside baseball information, to people as to what’s happening. The best way to find it, I think, [is to] find us on Facebook, facebook.com/freedomcaucus and at Twitter, simply @FreedomCaucus. Follow us. Subscribe at iTunes or SoundCloud. We encourage people to do that.
Davis: All right. Thank you so much.
Hice: Thank you.

"President Donald Trump rebuffed congressional efforts
to withdraw U.S. support from the war in Yemen on Tuesday, vetoing a bill that
would have forced the U.S. to cease support for the Saudi-led Arab coalition
fighting against Iran-backed Houthi rebels.
In his veto
statement, Trump explained:
This resolution is an unnecessary, dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities, endangering the lives of American citizens and brave service members, both today and in the future.
Trump clearly had strong legal, constitutional, and policy reasons for exercising his veto. 
For starters, his statement challenged the use of the War Powers Act as a basis for the legislation, S.J. Res. 7, because U.S. military forces were not directly engaged in hostilities in Yemen apart from occasional military operations against al-Qaeda and associated forces, which were explicitly exempted from the legislation. As the president said:  
This joint resolution is unnecessary because, apart from counterterrorism operations against al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and ISIS, the United States is not engaged in hostilities in or affecting Yemen.
Trump also sought to protect his constitutional authority
as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, as have many past presidents
confronted with war powers challenges. His veto statement declared:
S.J. Res. 7 is also dangerous. The Congress should not seek to prohibit certain tactical operations, such as in-flight refueling, or require military engagements to adhere to arbitrary timelines. Doing so would interfere with the president’s constitutional authority as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and could endanger our service members by impairing their ability to efficiently and effectively conduct military engagements and to withdraw in an orderly manner at the appropriate time.
A
Blunt Instrument That Rewards Iran
Trump’s veto is also strongly justified on policy
grounds. The Yemen war resolution from Congress is a blunt instrument that
could have inflicted severe collateral
damage on a range of U.S. national interests in the Middle East. 
It would have resulted in abandoning allies that are
fighting in Yemen to defend themselves and to restore the internationally recognized government of Yemen, which was
ousted by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in 2015 in a bloody coup that violated
a U.N.-brokered
ceasefire.
The Trump
administration has already stopped the aerial refueling of Saudi warplanes
involved in the Yemen conflict and called for a negotiated settlement. But the United
States cannot afford to desert its allies and hope for the best. Undermining
the Yemeni government and the Saudi-led coalition would make U.N.-brokered
efforts to reach an acceptable political settlement much more difficult.
It is
no
secret that many in Congress saw the vote as a means of punishing the Saudi
government for its involvement
in the death of Jamal Khashoggi last October. But the measure would have punished
not just Saudi Arabia, but also the government of Yemen, and other countries
fighting against the Houthis in the Saudi-led coalition: the United Arab
Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Senegal, and Sudan.
An end to U.S. support would also benefit
Iran, the Houthis’ chief source of support. Iran has sought to
transform the Houthi Ansar Allah movement into the “Hezbollah of Yemen”—a
permanent threat to regional stability and security that directly conflicts
with U.S. interests.
Iran has illegally transferred sophisticated ballistic
missiles, drones, and remote-controlled boat bombs to the Houthis, who have
used them to target cities, airports, and other civilian targets in Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
Given the potential consequences of the U.S. abandoning
its allies, it’s no wonder the Pentagon
and State
Department strongly pushed for continued support for the Saudi-led
coalition.
Congress lacks the votes to override Trump’s veto, so
his policy will stand. The House approved the measure earlier this month by a
vote of 247-175, and the Senate voted last month to approve it 54-46.  
Nonetheless, the Trump administration must remain on
guard against the same damaging restrictions being repackaged in future legislation.

"Caught up in a
conflict between long-standing NATO ally Turkey and a recently engaged Kurdish
tactical partner in Syria, the Trump administration has accommodated the
legitimate security interests of Turkey by staging a partial pullback of U.S.
special operations forces in northeastern Syria. 
It did so to get out of the way of a Turkish intervention launched Wednesday. 
Although critics of the Trump administration have rushed to denounce the decision as a “sellout” of the Syrian Kurds, that’s not true. Washington received no payoff from Ankara for stepping aside, and is not “abandoning the Kurds,” as many critics contend.  
Washington’s ad hoc partnership with Syrian Kurds never included a commitment to help them fight Turkey, only to fight the Islamic State, the terrorist army also known as ISIS.
The United States still supports Syrian Kurds against ISIS, just as it supports Iraqi Kurds and the Iraqi government against ISIS. But Washington has remained neutral with regard to Turkey’s complaints about the threats Syrian Kurds pose to Turkey.  
To be more specific, the Pentagon continues to support the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces against ISIS. It has declined, however, to work with the largest Kurdish armed faction within the those forces, the People’s Protection Units (YPG in its Kurdish acronym) to resist the Turkish intervention.
In geopolitical terms, that’s a logical and necessary decision.
Trump Warns Turkey’s President
Turkey is a long-term strategic ally that exercises major influence in the Middle East. The YPG is an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK in its Kurdish acronym), a U.S.-designated terrorist group that has waged war against Turkey off and on since 1984 in a bloody separatist insurrection that has claimed more than 40,000 lives.
Although the
Obama and Trump administrations accepted the YPG as a newfound tactical ally in
the war against ISIS, neither administration embraced the YPG/PKK agenda
regarding Turkey. 
Both
administrations stressed U.S. cooperation with the Syrian Democratic Forces, an
ad hoc anti-ISIS coalition in which the YPG influence was diluted by the
participation of Arab factions opposed to ISIS.
President Donald Trump on Oct. 7 warned Turkey against going “off limits” in Syria, and has threatened to apply economic sanctions if Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ignores the warning. 
The president doubled down on the sanctions threat Friday by authorizing the Treasury Department to prepare “significant sanctions” against Turkey, if necessary.  
That’s a far cry from giving Ankara a “green light,” as some critics contend. 
Washington also stands ready to act as an intermediary between its Syrian Kurdish partners and Ankara. After Turkey has secured its border, a possibility exists that the United States can broker an understanding that could mitigate friction between the two.
Nor is the Trump administration removing all U.S. troops from Syria at this time. The Pentagon has pulled back about 50 special operations troops from the Turkish-Syrian border, and up to 230 U.S. troops—out of the roughly 1,000 deployed in Syria—have been redeployed to the south, but remain in eastern Syria.  
Disagreements Over Buffer Zone  
The United States had been negotiating with Turkey on creating a buffer zone in northeastern Syria, in part to avert a unilateral Turkish intervention, which Ankara long had threatened. 
But Erdogan, apparently frustrated over the failure of Washington to accede to his demand for a zone 20 miles deep and 300 miles long along Turkey’s border, pulled the plug on the negotiations.  
Things came to a head Oct. 6, when Erdogan told Trump in a phone call that Turkey was determined to cross the border. After Erdogan stated that he would unilaterally establish the zone by force, Trump acquiesced and pulled U.S. troops out of harm’s way.
If that order had
not been given, there was a significant risk that U.S. troops would have been
caught up in the fighting or even drawn into a military clash with Turkey.  
Although there has been much handwringing over the administration’s failure to support the Kurds against Turkey, it’s difficult to see how battling a NATO ally would have preserved American credibility as an ally. 
Pentagon officials on Tuesday denied breathless press reports that defense officials had been blindsided by the president’s action, revealing that Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, actually had participated in the president’s phone call with Erdogan.
What some U.S. officials may have been surprised by was Trump’s tweet about a total U.S. withdrawal from Syria to end what he called “endless wars.” They know that the enemy gets a vote in ending any war, and ISIS by no means has given up fighting. 
Holding ISIS at Bay
U.S. vigilance will be necessary to block the terror group’s comeback. Trump must listen to his national security team and avoid declaring a premature end to war against ISIS.  
ISIS has returned
to its underground roots, but remains a potent threat to regional security and a long-term
threat to U.S. security if it can regroup. 
The Islamist extremist forces that morphed into ISIS already made a disastrous
comeback in Iraq in 2014 and could do so again in Syria.  
The underlying
political conditions that facilitated the rise of ISIS remain in Syria—anarchy,
dysfunctional government, and the systematic repression meted out by the Syrian
regime of Bashar Assad. Washington must be careful not to contribute to a power
vacuum that would make an ISIS resurgence easier.
The inspector general
for the coalition to defeat ISIS warned in a report in August that ISIS has
established “resurgent cells” in Syria and launched bombings, assassinations,
kidnappings, and suicide attacks in areas liberated by the Syrian Democratic
Forces.
Turkey is not in
a position to guarantee that ISIS will not return. It would have to fight its
way through the Kurds to get at ISIS.  
Erdogan, who has turned
a blind eye to the infiltration of foreign Islamist extremists into Syria
through Turkey, always has viewed the Kurds as a bigger threat to Turkey than
ISIS.
For better or worse, the Syrian Democratic Forces are a necessary partner in the struggle against ISIS. Not only does it have skilled and motivated fighters on the ground, but it controls more than 20 prisons and camps that hold about 12,000 ISIS fighters and 58,000 of their family members and supporters.
Bottom Line: Diplomacy Needed
The United States
will have to withdraw from Syria eventually. The real issue is whether Washington has made arrangements
to adequately protect U.S. interests; namely, preventing an ISIS resurgence,
blocking expansion of Iranian influence, and reaching a political settlement in
Syria that eases the humanitarian situation and allows the return of refugees.
The Turkish
intervention complicates efforts to attain those goals, but does not make them
impossible to achieve. 
It’s not too late to salvage an acceptable situation in eastern Syria if the administration can tamp down the fighting between Turkey and the  People’s Protection Units and maintain counterterrorism ties with the Syrian Democratic Forces.
Washington should push for a cease-fire in northeastern Syria and reach a clear understanding with Ankara about the size and purpose of Turkey’s new buffer zone. 
The long-term goal
should be to broker a sustainable understanding between Ankara and the Syrian
Kurds, similar to the understanding that it brokered between Ankara and Iraqi
Kurds.
Without such an
understanding, Turkey’s intervention will push the Syrian Kurds into the arms
of Russia and the Assad regime. Such an outcome would undermine U.S. national security
interests in the region, while promoting those of Iran and ISIS.

"Protesters gather in Tehran, Iran, on Friday to grieve the killing of Qassem Suleimani, a top Iranian general, by a U.S. drone strike Thursday in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad. (Photo: Fatemeh Bahrami/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)
Iran is threatening retaliation and Iraq is considering forcing U.S. officials out of the country after an American drone strike killed Qassem Suleimani, the notorious Iranian general blamed for the deaths of hundreds of Americans. 
Suleimani, leader of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and considered a terrorist by American officials for years, also headed Iranian-affiliated terrorist operations known for training Iran proxies they say are responsible for more than 600 American deaths.  
The U.S. strike near Baghdad International Airport that killed Suleimani followed the siege of the U.S. Embassy in Iraq led by Iranian-backed militias Tuesday. Protesters breached embassy walls in Baghdad and set fires and damaged property in response to a U.S. airstrike on Iranian-backed militias Sunday that killed 25. 
The killing of Suleimani already has widened the partisan divide in the United States.
Trump noted on Twitter: “Iran never won a war, but never lost a negotiation!”
Iran never won a war, but never lost a negotiation!
….of PROTESTERS killed in Iran itself. While Iran will never be able to properly admit it, Soleimani was both hated and feared within the country. They are not nearly as saddened as the leaders will let the outside world believe. He should have been taken out many years ago!
“General Qassem Soleimani has killed or badly wounded thousands of Americans over an extended period of time, and was plotting to kill many more…but got caught!” Trump tweeted, using a variant spelling of the general’s name. “He was directly and indirectly responsible for the death of millions of people, including the recent large number….of PROTESTERS killed in Iran itself. While Iran will never be able to properly admit it, Soleimani was both hated and feared within the country. They are not nearly as saddened as the leaders will let the outside world believe. He should have been taken out many years ago!”
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., criticized the president’s action for leaving Congress out of the decision and for potentially provoking more terror. 
“American leaders’ highest priority is to protect American lives and interests. But we cannot put the lives of American service members, diplomats, and others further at risk by engaging in provocative and disproportionate actions,” Pelosi said in a written statement late Thursday. “Tonight’s airstrike risks provoking further dangerous escalation of violence.  America—and the world—cannot afford to have tensions escalate to the point of no return.”
Pelosi added: 
The administration has conducted tonight’s strikes in Iraq targeting high-level Iranian military officials and killing Iranian Quds Force Commander Qasem Soleimani without an Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) against Iran. Further, this action was taken without the consultation of the Congress.
For the past 21 years,  Suleimani was commander of the Quds Force, a division of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps focused on military and spying operations outside Iran.  
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Suleimani, 62, was in the process of preparing additional attacks on U.S. diplomats in the region.
The State Department has warned Americans to leave Iraq. 
#Iraq: U.S. citizens in Iraq or concerned about loved ones in Iraq can contact the Department of State at 202-501-4444 or toll-free in the U.S. at 888-407-4747. Avoid the U.S. Embassy in #Baghdad. Monitor local and international media for updates. pic.twitter.com/jt8hcBU6uH
Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, issued a stern warning following word of Suleimani’s death.
“With his departure and with God’s power, his work and path will not cease, and severe revenge awaits those criminals who have tainted their filthy hands with his blood and the blood of the other martyrs of last night’s incident,” Khamenei said.
Iraqi Prime Minister Abdul-Mahdi called the U.S. drone strike an “assassination.”
“Why would the Soleimani assassination not immediately trigger a limited or even major conflict?” the Iraq leader said in a statement. “The structural factors are powerful.”
However, many Iraqi citizens were celebrating, as demonstrated in a Pompeo tweet.
Iraqis — Iraqis — dancing in the street for freedom; thankful that General Soleimani is no more. pic.twitter.com/huFcae3ap4
The U.S. attack reportedly also killed Iraq militia leader Jamal Jaafar Ibrahimi, also known as Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. 
This U.S. military success is comparable to the killing of Osama bin Laden in 2011, said James Jay Carafano, a retired Army lieutenant colonel who is vice president for national security and foreign policy at The Heritage Foundation. 
“The reported deaths of Iranian General Qassem Suleimani and the Iraqi commander of the militia that killed an American last week was a bold and decisive military action made possible by excellent intelligence and the courage of America’s service members,” Carafano said in a prepared statement. “The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, led by Suleimani, was responsible for the deaths of more than 600 Americans in Iraq between 2003-2011, and countless more injured.” 

“He was a chief architect behind Iran’s continuing reign of terror in the region,” Carafano said of Suleimani, adding:
This strike against one of the world’s most odious terrorists is no different than the mission which took out Osama bin Laden—it is, in fact, even more justifiable since he was in a foreign country directing terrorist attacks against Americans. 
His death is a huge loss for Iran’s regime and its Iraqi proxies, and a major operational and psychological victory for the United States.
Going forward, the Trump administration must keep its maximum pressure strategy in place. What the administration must offer now is firm diplomacy backed by the continuing, credible threat of the use of military force. President Trump has wisely shown that he will act with the full powers of his office when American interests are threatened, and the extremist regime in Tehran would be wise to take notice.
House Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith, D-Wash., said he was troubled by the “chain of events” that might now occur.     
“I do not want an open war with Iran, and neither do the American people. However, the absence of a coherent strategy has strained an already tense relationship between Washington and Tehran,” Smith said in a prepared statement. 
“It appears that in lieu of a strategy, the Trump administration has chosen military escalation. The administration must clearly articulate how this action, and potential future actions, will protect U.S. global interests while ensuring the safety and security of our personnel in the region and worldwide.”
However, Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and frequent Trump critic, strongly supported the administration’s action to take out the head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. 
“This is very simple: General Soleimani is dead because he was an evil bastard who murdered Americans. The president made the brave and right call, and Americans should be proud of our service members who got the job done,” Sasse said. 
“Tehran is on edge—the mullahs have already slaughtered at least a thousand innocent Iranians—and before they lash out further they should know that the U.S. military can bring any and all of these IRGC butchers to their knees.”

President Donald Trump’s new round of sanctions against Iran is the latest salvo in a wide-ranging effort to pressure the regime in Tehran. The goal is to halt Iran’s exportation of terror and subversion and force Iran to accept tighter restrictions on its nuclear program. 
The sanctions announced Monday add to an
already extensive set of punitive economic measures and specifically target
Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and several top officials in his
regime.
In addition to sanctioning the Office of the Supreme Leader, which is estimated to control a global network of companies worth $100-$200 billion, the Treasury Department sanctioned eight senior leaders of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, including the leaders of the Revolutionary Guard’s navy, aerospace, and ground forces.
The president imposed the new sanctions after canceling military strikes that he had ordered against Revolutionary Guard missile batteries in retaliation for the June 19 shoot-down of a U.S. Navy surveillance drone in international air space. 
The sanctions signal the Trump administration’s determination to continue its “maximum pressure” campaign against Tehran.
Not surprisingly, the sanctions triggered howls of protest in Tehran. President Hassan Rouhani denounced them as “outrageous and idiotic” and charged that the White House “was afflicted by mental retardation.” 
The spokesman for Iran’s Foreign Ministry said the sanctions “[mean] closing the doors of diplomacy by the U.S.”  
Trump responded with a series of tweets on Tuesday, including: 
Iran’s very ignorant and insulting statement, put out today, only shows that they do not understand reality. Any attack by Iran on anything American will be met with great and overwhelming force. In some areas, overwhelming will mean obliteration. No more John Kerry & Obama!
….Iran’s very ignorant and insulting statement, put out today, only shows that they do not understand reality. Any attack by Iran on anything American will be met with great and overwhelming force. In some areas, overwhelming will mean obliteration. No more John Kerry & Obama!
John Bolton, Trump’s national security adviser, blamed Iran for dragging its feet on diplomacy: 
The president has held the door open to real negotiations to completely and verifiably eliminate Iran’s nuclear weapons program, its pursuit of ballistic missile delivery systems, its support for international terrorism, and other malign behavior worldwide. All that Iran needs to do is to walk through that open door.
Maximum Pressure vs. Maximum
Blackmail
The slow-motion confrontation between Iran
and the U.S. is dramatically accelerating as the Trump administration’s “maximum
pressure” campaign takes effect, forcing Tehran to pay an increasingly painful
price for its hostile foreign policy and refusal to return
to nuclear negotiations.  
The World Bank estimates that Iran is on track for negative 4.5% real gross domestic product growth—the second-worst projection in the world on a key metric of economic health. 
Iran’s inflation rate has risen sharply from about 10% in mid-2018 to about 52% in April 2019, as the Iranian rial plummets in value and private spending contracts. 
Clearly, U.S. sanctions have had a
devastating impact, even without
European support.
Extensive economic sanctions against Iran were initially announced in Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s first major policy speech, which was given at The Heritage Foundation in May 2018. 
The new policy, he promised, would impose “unprecedented financial pressure” against Tehran unless it “halted its uranium enrichment program and hostile regional policies.” 
Unwilling to give up on either, Iran is
now paying an escalating price for its brazen commitment to fomenting
instability and violence in the Middle East and beyond.
Now barred from export markets and the international banking system, the mullahs are slowly being denied the resources they need to continue funding essential parts of their dangerous agenda. 
Tehran’s draft budget for 2019-2020 is evidence of a regime on the ropes: Among its many austerity measures, the regime planned to implement a 28% cut in funding to its military budget, including a 17% reduction for the Revolutionary Guard, which the State Department rightly designated as a foreign terrorist organization this April.  
That’s a significant blow for the Revolutionary Guard, which is a core part of Iran’s grand strategy, charged with acting as the sword and shield of Iran’s Islamic revolution. 
Iran’s Shadow War
The Revolutionary Guard carried out a series of attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman over the past two months, attacks that are part of Iran’s policy of pushing back against U.S. sanctions with veiled threats against Arab oil exporters and the flow of gulf oil. 
On May 12, four oil tankers carrying oil exports from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates—two adversaries that stood to gain materially by providing alternatives to Iranian oil—were sabotaged with limpet mines.  
After Washington sanctioned Iran’s
petrochemical exports, two petrochemical
tankers carrying Arab petrochemical exports were sabotaged
with limpet mines on June 13, and Revolutionary Guard personnel were videotaped
removing an unexploded limpet mine from the hull of one of the ships by a U.S.
Navy helicopter.  
To minimize the chances of further
embarrassing revelations, the Revolutionary Guard then shot down a U.S. Navy
surveillance drone on June 19 and falsely claimed it had strayed into Iranian
air space. 
The Revolutionary Guard’s low-intensity warfare is a calibrated, semi-clandestine campaign of intimidation aimed at expanding Tehran’s leverage by signaling resistance, exploiting the vulnerability of gulf oil exports, and threatening to escalate threats against Arab oil-exporting countries aligned with the United States.  
The goal is to force the Trump
administration to back down from its maximum pressure campaign and drive a
wedge between the U.S. and its European allies, which Tehran hopes will be
motivated to help shield Iran from U.S. sanctions.  
But this blackmail campaign is unlikely to
succeed. Iran’s attacks on oil tankers will not boost its own oil exports or
solve its sanctions problems, though they could backfire spectacularly by
triggering a costly war with the United States or a diplomatic backlash by
oil-importing countries threatened by Iran’s oil blackmail tactics.  
Trump, secure in the knowledge that his
strategy is paying dividends by penalizing Iran’s hostile policies, has doubled
down on his pressure campaign by imposing new economic sanctions and approving U.S.
cyberattacks against Revolutionary Guard military
computers that control rocket and missile launchers.  
Disabling Iranian missile sites through cyberattacks, rather than conventional military attacks, has several advantages. 
It underscores to Tehran that it is vulnerable to additional counter-threats, casts doubt on its military capabilities, and helps reassure nervous U.S. allies that Washington seeks a diplomatic resolution, not a war with Iran.  
Still, Iran’s ruthless regime remains on a
collision course with the United States. If it continues to reject diplomacy in
favor of violence and intimidation, then a military clash and perhaps a full-scale
war is increasingly likely.

"In a new resolution, a bipartisan group of senators is calling for the United States to end its involvement—specifically its support of Saudi Arabia—in the Yemen conflict.
On Wednesday, the Senate voted 63-37 to pass a procedural measure that will clear the way for a floor debate on the issue next week.
The push comes largely in response to the recent murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
The Trump administration has banned 21 Saudi suspects in that murder from entering the U.S., imposed sanctions on 17 Saudi officials, and expressed its willingness to take further action if warranted by ongoing investigations. Many senators seek to do more to punish the Saudis, even if it means sacrificing the interests of the Yemeni government and making a negotiated settlement of the conflict more difficult.
The killing of Khashoggi was certainly abhorrent, but ending U.S. support for the multinational coalition in Yemen is not the proper solution. It risks dangerously conflating two separate issues and would inevitably trigger unintended consequences that would undermine U.S. national security interests in the region.
Senators must remember that Saudi Arabia is not the only belligerent in Yemen. A cutoff of U.S. support would also hurt the elected and internationally recognized government of Yemen, which was ousted by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in 2015 in a bloody coup that violated a U.N.-brokered cease-fire.
Withdrawing U.S. support would also harm the interests of other U.S. allies fighting in Yemen, including the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.
The war in Yemen is complex. Those who rush to blame Saudi Arabia entirely for the suffering of the Yemeni people ignore the war crimes and heavy-handed treatment meted out by the Houthis to their opponents and the ruthless role that Iran plays in supporting the Houthi Ansar Allah (“Supporters of Allah”) movement, a Shia Islamist extremist group.
The Saudis are rightly criticized for not doing more to prevent civilian casualties as they target Ansar Allah positions. But the Houthis should not be given a free pass for deliberately targeting civilian targets in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates with increasingly sophisticated Iranian ballistic missiles.
Ansar Allah also deserves criticism for its violent role in destabilizing Yemen and creating the conditions that led to the current humanitarian disaster. Ansar Allah regularly attacks the Saudi border, launches missile strikes into Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and diverts international medical and food aid to favor its own supporters and sells on the black market.
Ansar Allah also has targeted U.S. Navy vessels, those of allied nations, and civilian shipping in the Red Sea with Iranian-supplied missiles, gunboat attacks, and boat bombs. Undermining the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen risks exacerbating this threat to international shipping and giving Iran the opportunity to threaten oil shipments through the Bab al-Mandab Strait, just as it has threatened to do in the Strait of Hormuz.
Those who advocate withdrawing support for Saudi Arabia apparently believe that they can somehow end the current conflict in Yemen through a one-sided strategy that penalizes allies and boosts Ansar Allah, a group that chants “Death to America” and looks more like Hezbollah, Iran’s Lebanese proxy group, every day.
Never mind that Saudi Arabia is supporting the internationally recognized government of Yemen in this effort. Never mind that leaving Ansar Allah to run amuck will not bring an end to the humanitarian suffering, but only prolong it.
The U.S. currently extends only limited support to Saudi Arabia in Yemen centered on intelligence and information sharing. There are no U.S. troops involved in combat operations, except for occasional commando raids and air strikes against Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, a Sunni terrorist group that continues to target the U.S. homeland, as well as Saudi Arabia, France, and other countries.
The Trump administration already has stopped the aerial refueling of Saudi warplanes involved in the Yemen conflict and called for a negotiated settlement. But the United States cannot afford to abandon its allies and hope for the best. Undermining the Yemeni government and the Saudi-led coalition would make an acceptable political settlement impossible.
The Yemeni government and Saudi Arabia will continue to fight this war with or without U.S. support. Those who would connect two unrelated issues, condemn Saudi involvement, and ignore Iran’s hostile role inside Yemen will only do more harm to innocent Yemeni civilians and empower Iran and its Yemeni proxies.

Iraq has been convulsed for the last week by widespread popular protests against government corruption, high unemployment, and inadequate government services. The risk grows that escalating violence associated with the protests could bring down Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi’s weak coalition government. 
The protesters, mainly in Baghdad and the Shiite-dominated south, are largely young people denouncing high rates of youth unemployment, endemic corruption, and poor public services. 
Over the past week, the message has evolved into a demand
for the ouster of the government, and the response from security officials has
escalated. More than 100 protesters have been killed and thousands injured as security
forces used live ammunition, tear gas, and rubber bullets to disperse the crowds.

The Iraqi government’s efforts to contain the chaos have been ineffective. After the protests first broke out Oct. 1, authorities blocked access to about 75% of the internet and imposed a round-the-clock curfew in Baghdad and other southern cities in an attempt to calm the streets. But the protests have mushroomed.  
The prime minister has proposed reforms, but they are
unlikely to satisfy the protesters, many of whom are young Shiite men who chafe
at the self-serving actions of the predominantly Shiite political parties that
dominate his coalition government.
The protesters have drawn support from some religious
leaders and opposition figures.  Iraq’s
top Shiite leader, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, has supported the demands of
the protesters and called
for an end to the violence “before it is too late.”  Sistani, a traditional religious leader who
opposes Iran’s theocratic political system, has been critical of Iraqi
political parties in the past. 
Muqtada al-Sadr, a powerful Shiite cleric who leads
the largest faction within the coalition government, quickly distanced himself
from Abdul Mahdi and called for early elections.
The protesters have aired many legitimate grievances,
particularly about party members exploiting their positions in government
ministries to siphon off resources for their own political supporters and
family networks.
Other protesters are motivated by resentment over
Iranian influence, which is seen as a threat to Iraqi sovereignty. 
Some protesters have carried pictures of Abdul Wahab
al-Saadi, a hero of the war against ISIS, who was dismissed
as the deputy commander of Iraq’s counterterrorism forces. There is widespread
suspicion Iran used its influence to sideline Saadi and other independent or
nationalist security officials it cannot control.    
The protests may bring down Abdul Mahdi, but the prime
minister’s successor likely will remain as mindful of Iranian preferences as he
has been.
The United States should recognize the legitimacy of
the grievances behind the protests, support the right of the protesters to
demonstrate peacefully, call for restraint by Iraqi police and internal
security forces, and press the Baghdad government to halt the ongoing purge of
security officials that Tehran perceives as being too independent.
Iraq’s wave of protests likely will continue and could
become even more violent.  Washington’s
message should be that Iraq’s leaders should support long overdue reforms if
they wish to retain popular legitimacy.

Turkey recently marked the three-year anniversary of the
country’s failed July 15 coup attempt, which resulted in hundreds of deaths and
almost succeeded in ousting Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. 
Since the coup’s failure, Erdogan has solidified his
control over the country—most notably the military and the press—and has turned
the anniversary of the coup into a holiday celebrating Turkish nationalism.
This year, as Erdogan waxed poetic about Turkish national
pride, he had a concrete symbol of his independence: the first round of
deliveries of the controversial S-400
air defense system from Russia, moving forward with a deal that
officials and analysts in Washington repeatedly warned would put substantial
strain on relations between Turkey and the United States.
It’s a bitterly disappointing end to a long series of signals from Ankara of potential delivery postponements, working groups, and bilateral discussions on the subject. Erdogan, having heard the objections of Congress, multiple Pentagon officials, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, has consciously chosen Moscow over the concerns of NATO. 
The S-400 system, designed by Russia to shoot down NATO
aircraft, poses a clear and present risk to U.S. national security if deployed on
Turkish soil, as it could expose the stealth capabilities of U.S.-designed F-35
fighter jets, which Turkey also has contracted to purchase.
President Donald Trump rightly responded on July 17 that
the U.S. would immediately
halt those F-35 sales, protecting one of the most important
instruments of U.S. military power. Sanctions also soon could be imposed on the
country under the 2017 Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act,
which provides a large menu of potential options to penalize countries that buy
arms from Russia.
But the U.S. isn’t alone in its frustrations with Erdogan. Last
week, he reignited a longstanding conflict over the territorial status of
Cyprus, directing Turkish ships to begin energy exploration in Cypriot waters on
behalf of a Turkish-led government on the island that only it recognizes.
The European Union, which also was clear in its objections
to such a confrontational decision, immediately suspended $154
million in aid to Turkey and asked its investment bank to review hundreds of
millions more in current lending to Ankara.
These are just the latest in years of accelerating anti-Western sentiment in Erdogan’s manner and behavior, which has classified him less as an ally and more as a “frenemy” in recent years. 
His repudiation of Western interests and values isn’t just a rhetorical tool: Turkey continually has frustrated U.S. strategic objectives in Syria and complicated efforts to mount an international campaign to contain Iran. 
He probably sees his defiance of the U.S. and the EU as helping bolster his popularity at home as his political support wanes—most recently and notably in his AK Party’s stronghold city of Istanbul.
Erdogan’s decisions to publicly break with the U.S. and its NATO allies, even as Turkey continues in name as a U.S. ally and maintains its petition for membership in the EU, have led Washington and the EU to levy sanctions against Turkey. The already-struggling Turkish economy will falter further as Erdogan continues to isolate himself from his international partners.
Trump’s expulsion of Turkey from the F-35 deal is a strong and appropriate step that sends a clear message to Ankara and protects U.S. national security. 
The Trump administration may impose sanctions against Turkey as well, under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, but as the discussion of punitive responses develops, the administration should take care to penalize adverse Turkish policies without breaking NATO ties. 
Despite Erdogan’s prickly leadership and increasingly anti-Western tone, Turkey remains an ally on many security issues, and the U.S. air base in Incirlik remains a valuable military asset in the Middle East. 
Erdogan won’t rule forever. As much as he would like to remain in power for life, his party’s dramatic Istanbul election defeat shows his political support is declining and he is likely to face greater challenges in future elections. 
As lamentable as it is that Ankara has drifted steadily away from the West under his leadership, Erdogan will pass—painfully, like a kidney stone—and a post-Erdogan Turkey should have the opportunity to recommit to its Western alliances instead of being forced into Moscow’s embrace.

"The slow-motion confrontation between the United
States and Iran is heating up, one year after Washington withdrew
from the Iran nuclear deal.
On Sunday, national security adviser John Bolton issued a terse statement:
In response to a number of troubling and escalatory indications and warnings, the United States is deploying the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group and a bomber task force to the U.S. Central Command region to send a clear and unmistakable message to the Iranian regime that any attack on United States interests or on those of our allies will be met with unrelenting force. The United States is not seeking war with the Iranian regime, but we are fully prepared to respond to any attack, whether by proxy, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or regular Iranian forces.
CNN reported that “specific and credible” intelligence indicated that Iranian forces and proxies were preparing for a possible attack against U.S. personnel or allies in Syria, Iraq, or at sea.
Intelligence provided
by Israel reportedly was at least part of the reason for
the warning and the naval redeployment.
The carrier strike group had been scheduled to deploy
in the Persian Gulf after exercises in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, but it
was diverted to expedite its arrival and boost the Pentagon’s capabilities for
deterring, defending against, and retaliating for possible Iran-sponsored
attacks.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also was diverted,
canceling a diplomatic mission to Germany to head to an undisclosed location.
Pompeo warned, “If these actions take
place, if they do by some third-party proxy, a militia group, Hezbollah, we
will hold the Iranian leadership directly accountable for that.”
Iran’s Islamist regime historically has used
Hezbollah, Iraqi militia groups, and Palestinian surrogates to attack its
enemies by “fighting to the last Arab.” 
Last month, the Pentagon released an updated assessment
that blamed Iran’s Revolutionary Guards for enabling Iraqi proxy forces to kill
603 American servicemen in Iraq.
And just last weekend, Iran
backed the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group’s provocations
that triggered the fiercest military clash between Israel and Hamas in Gaza
since the 2014 Gaza war.
Rising
Tensions and Veiled Threats
This week’s events are the latest in a series of
escalations by the U.S. and Iran. On April 8, the Trump administration designated
Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a foreign terrorist
organization. 
Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani responded by signing a
measure that declared all American forces in the Middle East terrorists and
labeling the U.S. a state sponsor of terrorism. 
On April 22, Pompeo announced
that Washington was not renewing waivers that allowed eight countries to
continue buying Iranian oil after the resumption of U.S. oil sanctions on Iran
last November.
This action ratcheted up sanctions to unprecedented
levels under the Trump administration’s “maximum pressure” campaign.  
Senior Iranian officials responded
by repeating past warnings that if the U.S. stops Iran from selling oil, Iran
will take action to prevent other Gulf oil-producing countries from exporting
their own oil.
The easiest way for Iran to do that is to try to block
the Strait
of Hormuz, the 21-mile-wide waterway at the eastern end of the Gulf,
through which flows approximately 30% of the world’s seaborne oil shipments.
The potential Iranian threat to this key strategic
chokepoint is another reason the U.S. Navy has expedited the deployment of the carrier
battle group to the region.
Iran’s next move may come on the nuclear front. Iranian
media have reported that Rouhani will
announce the resumption of some halted nuclear activities on
Wednesday, the first anniversary of the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear
agreement.
It is unclear whether this means Iran will formally withdraw from the agreement—but it could explain why Pompeo suddenly canceled his visit to Germany.

"The U.S. airstrike Thursday night that killed Iranian Gen. Qassim Suleimani was a bold and decisive effort to remove a key Iranian military and terrorist leader at a time when Iran appeared to be poised to escalate the crisis in Iraq by plotting an “imminent attack,” according to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
Suleimani was the mastermind behind Iran’s low-intensity warfare and terrorist campaign against the U.S. and its allies for many years. As the leader of the Quds Force, the elite special-operations wing of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Suleimani essentially served as Iran’s viceroy for Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon.
He
rose to prominence inside Iran and in the region by supervising Iran’s expanding
network of surrogate militias, terrorist groups, and radical Islamist
allies.
His
Quds Force orchestrated the formation, arming, training, and operations of a
foreign legion of Iraqi, Syrian, Lebanese, Afghan, Yemeni, and other militant
groups that Tehran has deployed to advance its imperial agenda and to export
Iran’s Islamist revolution.  
Iran long has used surrogate militias to do its dirty work in Iraq. One of the terrorists killed along with Suleimani was Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the leader of Kataib Hezbollah (“Brigades of the Party of God”). 
Like Suleimani, al-Muhandis was designated as a terrorist by the United States.  He was convicted and condemned to death in absentia in Kuwait for his involvement in the 1983 bombings of the U.S. and French embassies in Kuwait City. 
This radical Iraqi militia—modeled on Lebanon’s Hezbollah terrorist militia (which Suleimani also helped to build up)—was formed in 2007 as a proxy group under the direct command of Suleimani’s Quds Force. Kataib Hezbollah was one of the Iraqi militias that the Quds Force employed to kill more than 600 U.S. troops in Iraq from 2003 to 2011, according to Pentagon estimates.
Kataib
Hezbollah also was responsible for numerous rocket attacks in recent months on
U.S. troops in Iraq, including the Dec. 27 rocket attack that killed an
American citizen and provoked the current crisis.  The U.S. retaliated for the rocket attack
with airstrikes against five Kataib Hezbollah bases and weapons-storage sites
in Iraq and Syria on Dec. 29. 
This prompted Kataib Hezbollah and other Iran-backed militias to mobilize a mob that besieged the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad on Dec. 30-31 and tried to set in on fire. Suleimani arrived at Baghdad airport shortly thereafter, undoubtedly planning to orchestrate more dangerous attacks on U.S. personnel in Iraq.  
Suleimani’s death is a huge loss for Iran’s regime and its Iraqi proxies. It also is a major operational and psychological victory for the United States. 
The strong U.S. military response and demonstrated intelligence capacity to identify, track, and target Suleimani’s movements should bolster U.S. deterrence of Iranian aggression in the long run, although Iran is likely to escalate attacks in Iraq and elsewhere in the immediate aftermath of the strike.
But as Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said Thursday before the strike: “The game has changed.”  Washington will no longer tolerate attacks by Iran-backed proxy groups without inflicting a heavy price, not only on them, but on Iran, which historically has acted with impunity by conducting a shadow war through surrogates. 
This policy of holding Tehran accountable for the attacks of its proxies was announced by the White House in a 2018 statement, after Iranian-backed Iraqi militias attacked American diplomatic facilities in Iraq:
 Over the past few days, we have seen life-threatening attacks in Iraq, including on the United States Consulate in Basra and against the American Embassy compound in Baghdad. Iran did not act to stop these attacks by its proxies in Iraq, which it has supported with funding, training, and weapons.
The United States will hold the regime in Tehran accountable for any attack that results in injury to our personnel or damage to United States government facilities. America will respond swiftly and decisively in defense of American lives.
President
Donald Trump has repeatedly warned Iranian leaders about the potential
consequences of attacks on Americans. It should be no surprise that he enforced
his own “red line.”
The successful strike against Suleimani is a powerful message to Iranian leaders that their old tactics of “fighting to the last Iraqi” in a shadow war against the U.S. now entail many more risks and costs. If sustained over time, that could alter their cost-benefit calculus and lead them to moderate their hostile and aggressive policies.
But in the immediate aftermath of Suleimani’s death, Tehran is likely to respond on several tracks, as usual. On one track, it will play the victim card and seek to mobilize its Iraqi allies to expel the U.S. military presence through legislation passed by Iraq’s parliament or by a direct request of Iraq’s weak coalition government, which has been infiltrated by Iran’s Iraqi friends.
On
another track, the Quds Force is likely to employ its proxy network on a
variety of fronts to launch terrorist attacks and kidnapping operations to take
American hostages.   
Tehran also may choose to ratchet up its cyberattacks, assaults on oil tankers, and missile strikes on the energy infrastructure in the Persian Gulf, or accelerate its violations of its nuclear nonproliferation commitments.     
However,
all these tracks now have become increasingly risky. All are unlikely to yield
significant gains, but sure to provoke even stronger action from the Trump administration.      
The
conflict with Iran will continue, but the rules of the game are shifting.

What started out as spontaneous protests Oct. 17 opposing
a tax imposed on a popular messaging service escalated into the largest
political protests in Lebanon since the 2005 “Cedar Revolution” and forced the resignation
Tuesday of Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri.
Hariri’s action is unlikely to end the protests, which
have drawn a quarter of the country’s 4 million citizens into the streets to demand
the resignation of government leaders, an exit of the political elite, and a new
government system. 
The massive anti-government protests represent a widespread rejection of an entrenched and corrupt political oligarchy that has failed to deliver adequate basic services, including electricity, potable water, garbage collection, health services, and public transportation.  
The influx of more than 950,000 Syrian refugees into Lebanon further strained government services.   
Lebanon’s power-sharing system rewards sectarian
political parties and awards them Cabinet positions that the parties often use
to siphon off state resources.
The state-run electricity sector receives $2 billion of government subsidies each year, but is unable to provide electricity on a reliable basis. Most of Lebanon experiences daily power outages.  
The state-dominated telecommunications industry
charges customers notoriously high
prices. Local phone calls in Lebanon are five times more
expensive than local calls in Jordan and 20 times more expensive than in
Egypt.  
No wonder that imposing the new tax on messaging applications ignited protests by long-suffering Lebanese citizens.
Corruption and Mismanagement
Corruption allegations have motivated many recent anti-government protests in Algeria, Egypt, and Sudan, but the Lebanese protests most closely resemble the ongoing protests in Iraq.
For the past month, tens of thousands of young Iraqis have staged protests against high unemployment, corruption, and inadequate government services. As in Lebanon, the protests increasingly have assumed an anti-Iranian tint as political factions supported by Iran have opposed the protesters’ demands and attacked protesters.  
As a result, a strong popular backlash has erupted against Iranian influence. But unlike Iraq, Lebanon has little oil wealth that could be used to fund government reforms.  
Lebanon is facing enormous domestic challenges. Its economy
and trade routes have been disrupted by the ongoing war in neighboring Syria. In
addition to high unemployment and slow economic growth—projected  to be 2% in 2019—Lebanon’s national debt has
surged to $86 billion, more than 150% of its gross domestic product, one of the
highest debt ratios in the world.
Merely servicing the debt consumes about 45% of government revenues, which has motivated official efforts to find new sources of tax revenue.
Protests have remained secular in nature, with
Christian, Shiite, and Sunni protesters waving the Lebanese flag and chanting
anti-government slogans such as “All of them means all of them,” and calling
out political elites who have fueled sectarian tensions for their own benefit. 
Demonstrations spread across cities in northern
Lebanon, Beirut, as well as Hezbollah southern strongholds, including Tyre and
Nabatieh. Surprisingly, southern protesters chanted anti-Hezbollah rhetoric even
after Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, warned against forcing the
resignation of the government elite.
Nasrallah said protesters need to “let this government
continue but with a new spirit and a new way of working … [learning] its lesson
from the last two days of popular outburst.” 
Hezbollah supporters also have tried to disrupt the
protests. In a viral video posted on social media, the Lebanese army was seen
blocking motorcyclists bearing flags of Hezbollah and Amal, an allied Shiite
party, from entering protest squares in the capital city of Beirut.
The respite was short-lived, though, as Hezbollah and
Amal members later attacked
protesters in Beirut. Lebanon remains on edge and could rapidly descend into
widespread political violence if political tensions are not eased soon.  
No
Clear Way Forward
In an effort to calm protests, Hariri announced
a series of cost-cutting reforms Oct. 21, promising a reduction of government
salaries, a reformed electricity sector, and downsizing and/or cutting of
obsolete government institutions such as the Ministry of Information. 
But the protesters rejected the concessions as being too little too late, and Hariri was forced to resign.
Lebanese President Michel Aoun, who is aligned with Hezbollah, may decide not to accept Hariri’s resignation, just as he did in November 2017, when Hariri resigned under pressure from Saudi Arabia.
But if accepted, Hariri’s resignation will prompt negotiations over the appointment of a new prime minister and a reshuffling of the coalition government. It is doubtful, however, that any deal negotiated by Lebanon’s discredited leaders will satisfy the protesters, who have demanded that the government be run by technocrats who are not beholden to sectarian political parties widely regarded as corrupt.
Regardless, the wave of protests across the Middle
East underscore the increasing disconnect between political elites and the
citizens they are supposed to represent. 
Like most of the Arab world, Lebanon’s young people
are better educated and more demanding than their parents: 40% of those under 25
have reached the highest levels of the nation’s education system, but the
unemployment rate is 37% for those 35 and under. 
Recognizing the crippling effects of sectarianism, young protesters in the Middle East have rejected such agendas and echoed similar demands: economic opportunity, the purging of corruption, and a systemic overhaul of political systems. Self-interested and unaccountable political parties, the protesters argue,  have failed time and time again to address legitimate popular grievances.

"The Turkish government Tuesday reaffirmed its intention to complete the controversial purchase of a Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile defense system, a move appropriately drawing the ire of both parties in Washington. 
Both
Congress and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have warned of punitive action
should Turkey follow through on the purchase, which Turkey says could be
completed as soon as next month. 
“Turkey’s purchase of the S-400 would be incompatible with its commitments to NATO,” Sens. James Inhofe, R-Okla.; Jack Reed, D-R.I.; James Risch, R-Idaho; and Robert Menendez, D-N.J.; wrote in a New York Times op-ed in early April. 
Yet, despite this widespread U.S. criticism and the Trump administration’s promise of a punitive response, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has called the purchase “a done deal” and has already begun preparing his nation for retaliatory U.S. sanctions once the Russian missile defense system is delivered.
Congress
is right to oppose the deal. 
As was noted last year in The National Interest, the S-400 is a “real game changer” with exceptional anti-aircraft capabilities and a wide range of other advantages, from the ability to detect stealth aircraft to the ability to detect, target, and engage non-stealth aircraft at a greater range than that of its American competitor, the Patriot system. 
It shouldn’t come as a surprise that Russia has found no shortage of customers for the S-400. As Moscow prepares to deliver it to Turkey, it also has begun negotiations to sell it to Egypt, India, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. 
Russia’s
sale of the S-400 system to the Turkish government is a direct threat to the
national security interests of both NATO and the U.S. It would draw Turkey, a
NATO member state, closer to Russia precisely at a moment when the U.S. is
seeking to limit Moscow’s largely malicious meddling in the region. 
But the U.S. national interest does not end at the symbolism of the sale. The S-400 system, a Russian invention, would be inoperable with existing NATO weapons systems—and Erdogan has promised to help Russia build the next generation of systems, known as the S-500. 
This deal, far from a one-time agreement, could well become a dangerous and lasting partnership, especially as U.S.-Turkey relations have already slipped to “frenemy” status. 
The
largest sticking point for the U.S. government, however, has been the prospect
of Turkey’s possession of both the S-400 system and U.S.-designed F-35 fighter
jets simultaneously.
Turkey, a relatively new customer, formally received its first four F-35s in June 2018, though the jets still remain in the U.S. at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona, where Turkish pilots are training on them. Those F-35s are part of a much larger deal intended to shore up the capabilities of the Turkish air force.
As
the bipartisan group of U.S. senators noted rightly in their New York Times op-ed,
allowing Turkey to obtain the Russian-made S-400 is an “unacceptable risk,
because its radar system could enable the Russian military to figure out how
the F-35 operates.” 
Specifically
at risk is the F-35’s stealth capability: The Russian military could
potentially study how the jet fighters interact with the S-400 system, working
around the stealth technology and betraying a key U.S. strategic advantage
around the world. 
That’s
a bona fide threat to national security.
While
the Pentagon has already paused the delivery of additional F-35s to Ankara,
Congress and the State Department seem willing to take even firmer action,
including canceling the F-35 sale entirely and closing off Turkish parts
manufacturers for the fighter jets in favor of European alternatives.
Turkey, which has already invested $125 million in the development of the F-35, could lose part of its defense industrial base that was dedicated to that program. 
What’s
more, the U.S. could impose economic sanctions on Turkey under the 2017
Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, which recommends
punitive economic steps against any countries that buy Russian military
technology.
Although Erdogan doubts American resolve, saying that his country will “sooner or later … receive the F-35s,” the prospect of a retaliatory U.S. response has rightly caused Ankara to waver.
Yet, Turkey seems determined to press on. Erdogan, seemingly unmoved by offers instead to purchase the U.S.-made Patriot air defense system and increasingly toying with anti-American rhetoric, seems to see the Russian relationship as more important. 
To be
sure, Turkey and Russia are growing ever closer as Turkey seeks solutions for
its security challenges and economic woes, but this cooperation is hugely
dangerous for the NATO alliance—and therefore, for Turkey itself. 
Erdogan
would do well to understand the reality: NATO is his only real security
partner. Vladimir Putin’s Russia is neither interested in, nor benefits from,
Turkish security and prosperity. 
Putin’s
efforts to separate Turkey and other Middle Eastern states from their U.S.
partnerships are not an attempt to give them a better alternative. They are
singularly focused on driving a wedge between Washington and its NATO and
Middle Eastern allies to counter what he sees as challenges to Russian
influence.
Ankara
still has time to back away from this misguided agreement and embrace its best
hope of a lasting security and economic partnership with the U.S. and its other
NATO allies. 
Although
Erdogan called President Donald Trump on May 29 to discuss the S-400 issue,
U.S. officials have denied Turkish claims that Trump agreed to establish a
bilateral working group to study how to mitigate the risks posed by the Russian
weapons system.  
A Pentagon spokesman rejected those claims. 
“We have been clear that purchasing the S-400 would create an unacceptable risk because its radar system could provide the Russian military sensitive information on the F-35.  Those concerns cannot be mitigated,” Defense Department spokesman Eric Pahon told the Al-Monitor website.
In
any event, Trump is unlikely to be receptive to Ankara’s stubborn foot-dragging
on the issue. The president has spent years lambasting NATO allies and others
who fail to contribute to the security relationship and rely unfairly on the
benevolence of the U.S. government. 
In
recent years, Turkey has been one of the worst offenders on both counts. The
S-400 system, should it be set up on Turkish soil, would be one of the most
obvious betrayals of that trust in decades.

"People inspect the damage after a missile attack targeted a camp during a military parade in Aden, Yemen, Aug. 1, 2019. (Photo: Wail Shaif/picture alliance/Getty Images)

Nicole Robinson

Nicole Robinson is a research assistant in the Allison Center for Foreign Policy at The Heritage Foundation.
Two separate terrorist attacks earlier this month struck the Yemeni governorate of Aden, and those were followed by a third attack in Abyan.
All told, the attacks reportedly killed at
least 68, including security personnel from the United Arab Emirates-backed
Security Belt Forces, shaking the relative calm in one of the deadliest
eruptions of violence in southern Yemen in two years. 
The Security Belt Forces is an elite
paramilitary unit connected to the Southern Transitional Council, a
secessionist political organization calling for southern Yemen’s independence. 
The first attack took place Aug. 1 in the Sheikh Othman neighborhood of Aden, when a suicide bomber targeted a security center during the morning lineup. 
The death toll was 13, according to the Yemeni
Ministry of the Interior. The next day, ISIS claimed responsibility for the
attack. 
Yemen’s southern provinces have long been a stronghold
for Islamist extremist groups, and the attacks might point to a growth in
extremist presence as the United Arab Emirates takes a less overt role in the
conflict.
The second attack, also on Aug. 1, came in
the form of a missile strike that hit a military parade in the al-Jala camp
near the Buraiqa district in Aden, claiming the lives of at least 30 Security
Belt personnel and also killing Abu al-Yamama, the leading Yemeni
counterterrorism commander of those forces. 
The Iran-backed Shiite Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement released by Brig. Gen. Yehya Sarea, a Houthi military spokesman. He boasted that “the joint operation against the al-Jala camp successfully targeted a military parade for the invaders and mercenaries [of Aden].”
He cited the recent advancement of military
positions in the provinces of al-Dhale and Taiz as cause for the attack.
The day after the two attacks, Yemeni security officials say, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula militants stormed al-Mahfad military camp in the governorate of Abyan, taking advantage of the chaos from the attacks in Aden the day before. The incident claimed the lives of at least 19 Security Belt Forces personnel in a foiled attempt to take control of the camp. 
The Shabwani Elite—a United Arab
Emirates-backed paramilitary unit focused on counterterrorism operations—reportedly
helped assist Abyan security forces to retake the area after it was briefly
captured. 
Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula subsequently claimed responsibility for the attack. 
The U.N. special envoy for Yemen released a statement Aug. 1 on Twitter claiming to be “gravely concerned by the escalation of violence” in Aden, but failing to condemn the attacks. There was no comment by the U.N. special envoy for Yemen about the al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula attack in Abyan the following day. 
The three attacks represent a real
possibility of escalation in the south from both Houthi rebels and extremist
groups, exposing the possible weakness of local security forces to attacks in
the heart of the areas they control. 
Both al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and
ISIS may be testing the readiness of Security Belt Forces and other local
security providers following the recent United Arab Emirates’ drawdown of its
military presence. 
Houthi fighters and extremist militants are likely to continue to strike security infrastructure in the south to further fragment the Saudi-led Arab military coalition and its allies.
If attacks continue on an upward trajectory, from either the Houthis or other Islamic extremists, the U.N. special envoy to Yemen, Martin Griffiths, will face intense pressure from the international community to revive stalled peace talks and seek a viable peace settlement.

"In a historic move on Monday, Secretary of State Mike
Pompeo announced the designation of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as
a foreign terrorist organization. 
This is the first time the U.S. has given the
designation to part of a government.
The designation will enable the U.S. to further ramp
up sanctions against Iran’s tyrannical regime under the administration’s
“maximum pressure” policy.
The Revolutionary Guard Corps is both the sword and
shield of Iran’s Islamic revolution, dating back to 1979. It is charged with
attacking Iran’s enemies overseas, supporting Iran’s network of foreign
terrorist proxies, and crushing political opposition to Iran’s revolutionary regime
at home.
Last week, the Pentagon released an updated assessment that blamed Iran’s Revolutionary Guard for enabling Iraqi proxy forces to kill 603 American servicemen in Iraq. That accounts for about 17% of the total deaths of U.S. personnel from 2003 to 2011.
The Revolutionary Guard also controls Iran’s ballistic
missile program, military aspects of its nuclear program, and key portions of
Iran’s state-dominated economy.
The designation as a foreign terrorist organization will
become effective next Monday, at which time the U.S. government will gain
additional tools for applying sanctions against the Revolutionary Guards and
all foreign entities that do business with them, their subsidiaries, and their
front companies.  
This will allow U.S. sanctions to hit harder at strategic sectors of Iran’s economy, since the Revolutionary Guard is extensively involved in Iran’s oil, construction, and defense industries. As CIA director in 2017, Pompeo estimated that the Revolutionary Guard controlled about 20% of Iran’s economy.
These added sanctions will drain away resources that
could be used to export terrorism, thus helping bolster the security of the
U.S. and its allies. This will also benefit the Iranian people, who are the
chief victims of the Revolutionary Guard.
The new sanctions also will ratchet up pressure on
foreign firms that continue to do business with Iran. Such firms could now face
prosecution in U.S. courts for providing material support for terrorism if they
engage in commerce with Iranian entities affiliated with the Revolutionary Guard.
President Donald Trump hammered this point home in a White
House statement Monday when he warned: “If
you are doing business with the [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps], you will
be bankrolling terrorism.” 
He also made it clear that more Iran sanctions are
coming: 
This action sends a clear message to Tehran that its support for terrorism has serious consequences. We will continue to increase financial pressure and raise the costs on the Iranian regime for its support of terrorist activity until it abandons its malign and outlaw behavior.
This added pressure on Iran’s economy is sure to put greater
stress on the Iranian regime, which already faces growing discontent from Iranians.
The Trump administration hopes that stronger sanctions will compel Tehran to
moderate its hostile policies or risk being overthrown by its own people.

"President Donald Trump pulled the plug on the Iran nuclear deal Tuesday, taking it off life support after months of warning that the flawed 2015 agreement needed to be ended or mended.
When it became clear that France, Germany, and the United Kingdom—three other signatories to the nuclear deal—could not reach an acceptable agreement with Washington on how to correct flaws in the deal, the president announced that the U.S. would withdraw from the agreement and re-impose sanctions:
We will be instituting the highest level of economic sanction. Any nation that helps Iran in its quest for nuclear weapons could also be strongly sanctioned by the United States. America will not be held hostage to nuclear blackmail.
In his speech, the president noted that at the heart of the nuclear agreement “was a giant fiction that a murderous regime desired only a peaceful nuclear energy program.”
He said:
The Iran deal is defective at its core. If we do nothing, we know exactly what will happen. In just a short period of time, the world’s leading state sponsor of terror will be on the cusp of acquiring the world’s most dangerous weapons.
Trump also warned, “If the regime continues its nuclear aspirations, it will have bigger problems than it has ever had before.”
But he was careful to distinguish between the regime and “the longsuffering people of Iran,” whom he assured: “The people of America stand with you.”
This implicit call for regime change was balanced with a willingness to negotiate a new deal with Iran. He acknowledged that Iran’s leaders had ruled out new nuclear negotiations, but ended on a hopeful note: “ … [T]hey are going to want to make a new and lasting deal, one that benefits all of Iran and the Iranian people. When they do, I am ready, willing, and able.”
This was precisely the right message to send. The diplomatic ball is now in Iran’s court.
Iran’s rulers can make the situation worse by threatening to crank up their nuclear program, or they can seek a diplomatic solution to their deepening economic problems.

"Since the election of President Donald Trump, the European Union and the United States have increasingly disagreed on Iran policy. The divergence widened in May with Trump’s announcement that the United States was withdrawing from the Iran nuclear agreement.
Washington has since reimposed nuclear sanctions on Iran in two rounds in August and November. Meanwhile, the EU has sought to preserve the nuclear agreement by trying to protect Iran from renewed sanctions.
The EU’s campaign to shield Iran from U.S. sanctions is doomed to fail.
The biggest European companies already have voted with their wallets and pulled out of Iran. They have a lot more to lose if they are cut off from the U.S. market by secondary sanctions than they have to gain from trade with Iran’s much smaller market.
Market forces are too strong for such companies to ignore their economic interests in maintaining access to the U.S. market to oblige EU bureaucrats more worried about alleged U.S. “economic imperialism” than they are about the terrorism, subversion, and ballistic missiles exported by Iran.
The danger is that smaller European companies, with little or no stake in trade with the United States, could risk sanctions and continue trading or investing in Iran. This would dilute the impact and undermine the effectiveness of U.S. sanctions.
European allies played a major role in ratcheting up sanctions pressure on Iran in 2012-13, and they remain a key channel for restoring sanctions pressure now. The EU is Iran’s second-largest trading partner, after China, and a leading consumer of Iran’s oil exports.
Kicking the Tires on the Special Purpose Vehicle
As part of a package of economic incentives designed to induce Iran to remain in the nuclear agreement, the foreign ministers of the EU, Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and China met on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in September to hash out the creation of a “Special Purpose Vehicle”—a new mechanism to facilitate trade between Iran and other states and avoid U.S. sanctions.
The details of the SPV are still being worked out. It would be a clearinghouse that uses some form of a barter system to enable Iran to continue trading its oil for European goods and other goods. Iranian firms could use the SPV to accumulate credits for their exports that could be used to pay for imports from other foreign companies participating in the SPV.
Essentially, the SPV would function like an escrow agent, periodically settling the balance between exports and imports. It would use euros or sterling, rather than U.S. dollars, to minimize the exposure of participating companies to U.S. sanctions.
The Trump administration has strongly denounced the EU’s SPV strategy. Additionally, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blasted the scheme, calling it “one of the most counterproductive measures imaginable for regional and global peace and security.”
National security adviser John Bolton warned that the United States does “not intend to allow our sanctions to be evaded by Europe or anybody else.”
Washington could take action against SPV-enabled trade by applying sanctions against the banks that transfer money into and out of the SPV, as well as officials who create or operate within the SPV.
Although Washington would not have the same visibility into SPV transactions as in SWIFT transactions, it also could target firms that participate in SPV trade. This will deter most firms from participating, except for small companies heavily dependent on Iran for income.
Symbolism Over Security
By colluding with Russia and China to evade U.S. sanctions, the EU seeks to appease Iran, keep it in the flawed 2015 nuclear deal , and deliver a symbolic diplomatic slap to the Trump administration.
But the SPV and other measures such as EU’s updated Blocking Statute are not likely to meet Iran’s demands for remaining in the nuclear agreement. These measures may marginally reduce the impact of U.S. sanctions on trade, but they will not satisfy Tehran’s need for substantial foreign investment and technology transfer.
Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Kazem Sajjadpour signaled Tehran’s frustration with the limited progress made on EU efforts to bypass U.S. sanctions: “What is lacking is both speed and efficiency.”
Iran’s distrust of EU bureaucrats is shared by many European businessmen, who are unwilling to risk being targeted by U.S. sanctions that would impose concrete economic penalties in order to enable EU officials to take a symbolic stand against Washington.
To make matters worse, the SPV will be open to non-European firms, meaning that the EU will be enabling Russia and China to advance their own economic and geopolitical interests regarding Iran.
The EU’s misguided efforts to appease Iran not only facilitate Iran’s hegemonic ambitions, but they also could jeopardize the security of EU citizens.
Tehran recently was caught red-handed in foiled plots to bomb an Iranian exile rally in France in June 2018 and an effort to assassinate the exiled leaders of a separatist Arab Iranian opposition group in Denmark in October.
Such activity is nothing new. The Tehran regime has orchestrated a long list of terrorist attacks and political assassinations in Europe.
Yet the EU’s craven efforts to propitiate Iran are likely to increase the risks of future attacks by Iran or its surrogates, including Hezbollah.
The bottom line is that the EU can undermine the impact of U.S. sanctions, but cannot fully protect Iran from the consequences of its hostile policies.
Meanwhile, the EU is gambling with the security of its own citizens as well as the security of its Middle East allies threatened by Iran in a dangerous effort to appease Tehran.

After midnight on Feb. 27, 2014, dozens of Russian marines left their barracks in Sebastopol. Heavily armed and dressed in civilian garb, they stormed the regional parliament and started a war in Ukraine that still simmers today.
Russian President Vladimir Putin is fighting a different kind of conflict against his enemies in the West, and Ukraine has become the proving ground for a witch’s brew of tactics that are popularly called hybrid warfare.
Hybrid warfare is a strategy that blends conventional and unconventional military tactics and can include a mixture of energy and security threats, propaganda, cyberattacks, and the use of organized crime alongside traditional military capabilities like ground forces, tanks, and planes.
Putin has tried to disguise his attacks on eastern Ukraine as a civil war by pairing conventional Russian military forces with mercenaries and local dissidents.
Russians package lethal attacks with intimidation, obfuscation, and corruption measures called disinformation and active measures. Putin has used the Russian Orthodox Church to stir up minorities and attack anti-corruption efforts like Ukraine health care reforms.
The FSB (Russian intelligence) uses social media platforms to incite extremism. Russian intelligence even recruited a French citizen to attempt to smuggle weapons out of Crimea and organize terrorist attacks in France. This action could then be blamed on support from “fascists” in Ukraine.
Learning how to counter these terrible “hybrid warfare” tactics and defanging Putin’s capacity to destabilize the West is a priority for NATO.
The current situation in Ukraine warrants further exploration into how sovereign nations can counter hybrid warfare tactics.
Establishing a NATO-certified center of excellence on hybrid warfare in Ukraine would be a step in the right direction.
Centers of Excellence are international organizations certified by NATO that train individuals in particular security matters from both NATO member and partner countries.
NATO has 24 certified Centers of Excellence that work on a range of issues from cold weather operations in Bodø, Norway, to defense against terrorism in Ankara, Turkey.
Several of the existing Centers of Excellence study specific components of hybrid warfare like cybersecurity and energy security. However, no single center studies hybrid warfare and how best to counteract it in its entirety.
The United States and NATO can learn a lot from Ukraine. The country’s three-year conflict with Russia makes it a prime location for this endeavor.
While Ukraine is not a NATO member country, opening a center of excellence on hybrid warfare in Ukraine would both strengthen NATO-Ukraine relations and allow for a meaningful dialogue and training on addressing hybrid warfare challenges.
It would also provide NATO member countries direct insight into and preparation for countering hybrid warfare tactics. Ukraine’s current knowledge of counteracting hybrid warfare would be expanded by the creation of this center.
This is not just good for Ukraine but also NATO member countries.
Putin’s hybrid warfare strategies pose a threat to Ukraine and a clear challenge to both U.S. and NATO interests. The menace does not appear to be going away any time soon and could actually increase in the coming years. Establishing a center of excellence in Ukraine to study and combat hybrid warfare is key to the future security of Ukraine and NATO.

On March 8, the world will recognize International Women’s Day. This year, the campaign hopes to highlight global gender inequalities and advocate change under the slogan “Press for Progress.”
Women across the globe face unique challenges to obtaining the same rights and privileges as their male counterparts. Recent protests over compulsory hijab laws in Iran remind us all why International Women’s Day is important.
In December 2017, protests broke out across Iran over the negligence of government officials and the failing Iranian economy. However, the protests quickly gave way to a public outcry over gender discrimination laws. One woman in particular caught international attention when she stood on a street corner waving her hijab over her head.
Whether a woman wants to wear a hijab should be her personal decision. However, Iranian religious law has dictated female dress code in public since the Iranian Revolution in 1979.
Under this law, all women and girls over the age of 9 are required to wear a hijab in public. For any woman to remove her hijab in the public square is a crime and puts her at risk of incarceration in some of Iran’s most notorious prisons.
However, rather than be intimidated, this woman set off a wave of hijab protests.
Now, women across Iran are risking their lives to protest compulsory hijab laws. Within the last week, police pulled a hijab-less woman from a telephone cable box, causing her injuries. Videos of the incident made their rounds on social media and incited further protests.
Amnesty International reports that dozens of Iranian women are currently at risk of long jail terms for protesting compulsory hijabs. At least 35 have been arrested in Tehran alone, with several reportedly subjected to torture while in prison.
In an official statement, the Iranian police warned women that if they continue removing their hijabs in protest, they would be charged with inciting corruption and prostitution—a crime that carries a hefty jail sentence.
Compulsory hijab laws are not the only challenge that Iranian women face. Just last month, the Iranian state television ran a program calling for victims of domestic abuse to “kiss their husband’s feet.” A ban on women in sports stadiums led to at least 35 women being arrested for attempting to attend a soccer match.
A woman cannot get married without the consent of her male guardian. Married women cannot leave the country without their husband’s permission. Even Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has described the idea of gender equality as unacceptable for society.
Despite the dire human rights situation and potential backlash from governmental authorities, the women of Iran are demanding change. The Iranian government released a report stating that the majority of Iranians disagree with compulsory hijab laws.
More women are protesting despite more arrests being made. Iranians have even taken to social media to protest compulsory hijab laws and the bans on women attending sporting events.
On this International Women’s Day, the world will reflect on the progress women have made and the challenges they still face. As we celebrate this day, do not forget the women of Iran and the sacrifice they are making to fight for women’s rights.

Years of internal conflicts and poor governance are not the only problems facing the African countries of South Sudan, Nigeria, and Somalia.
The United Nations recently declared famine in parts of South Sudan and Nigeria. Judging by current conditions, it won’t be long before Somalia follows suit.
The number of people affected is staggering. In South Sudan, 100,000 people are on the verge of starvation with another 5 million at risk. That number of at-risk people totals 6.2 million in Somalia—half of its population—and 4.4 million in Nigeria.
Across all three countries, roughly 1.4 million children are at imminent risk of death. Those numbers are unlikely to decrease anytime soon and could even increase in the coming weeks.
This is not the first time these three nations have faced famine and starvation. The semi-arid climates in parts of their countries make them prone to drought.
But this current famine was brought on by more than below-average rainfall. Humanitarian aid organizations and the U.S. State Department have called the famine in South Sudan “man-made.”
It is not difficult to understand why. Weather conditions may cause drought, but poor governance and instability quickly turn a drought into a humanitarian crisis.
Take South Sudan as an example.
After 25 years of war, the country gained independence from Sudan in 2011. Only 18 months later, tensions within the government plunged the South Sudanese nation into a crippling civil war that cut off South Sudan’s trade routes with neighboring countries, prevented farmers from growing and harvesting food, and caused remaining food prices to skyrocket.
A famine was narrowly averted in 2014 thanks only to a massive international humanitarian effort. However, famine looms again. Various countries have pledged help for this latest hunger crisis, but this relief may never reach the people who need it most.
Despite the South Sudanese government promising “unimpeded access” for aid workers in the country, the South Sudanese security services and aligned forces frequently block the delivery of humanitarian relief.
The government has delayed agencies’ paperwork that would allow them to distribute aid. Soldiers have instituted military checkpoints around famine stricken areas and are preventing relief workers from crossing them.
The government is blocking aid for a number of likely reasons. It has for years stirred up anti-Western and anti-U.N. sentiment over the international community’s pressure on the government to halt its campaign of war crimes and ethnic killings. It may be blocking humanitarian aid in an attempt to retaliate.
The government is also likely blocking aid to rebel-controlled or influenced areas to punish those communities for what the government believes is their support for the rebels.
Poor governance and internal conflict have similarly contributed to the hunger crises in Somalia and Nigeria. Internal conflict has wreaked havoc in Somalia for nearly three decades, and the internationally-backed government has been mired in corruption and bickering.
Furthermore, the government has been unable to extend its authority to much of the country.
Nigeria’s government is relatively stable, but for years it has mismanaged the fight against the ISIS-aligned Boko Haram terrorist group that at one point controlled much of northeast Nigeria. Now, that same northeast region—torn by violence and terrorism—faces the worst of this famine crisis.
As the current humanitarian crisis grows, the international community will continue to offer emergency relief, and it should. But without better governance and stability in these countries, there is only so much these efforts will achieve.
Note: This article has been updated to correct the location of Nigeria that Boko Haram once largely controlled.

"While violent civil conflicts have prevailed elsewhere in the Middle East since the Arab Spring of 2011, Tunisia has pursued a transition to democracy without bloodshed.
In 2014, the country made massive strides, adopting a new constitution, and then holding its first full parliamentary and presidential elections under that constitution.
As with any young democracy, Tunisia’s government continues to face daunting tasks. At the top of the government’s to-do list are revitalizing the economy and building the public’s confidence in a fledgling democracy.
That’s a tall order, and government leaders will need to continue working with Tunisia’s robust and vibrant civil society and youth population to make it work.
Job opportunities and training for the young are especially crucial, as they represent a huge slice of the population. They also, as the truism goes, represent Tunisia’s future.
To solidify their support for democracy, it is vital that the younger generation experiences, early on, the benefits of a free economy. Failure to meet expectations could result in disillusionment with democracy itself and bring the risk of instability.
On the broader economic front, structural reforms must be carried out more decisively to show that democracy can bring measureable prosperity for the ordinary Tunisian.
Tunisia has relied on international loans to jumpstart its economy in the face of increasing oil prices and decreasing tourism. However, failure to improve current economic conditions has less to do with financial support from international partners and more with Tunisia’s own shortcomings, particularly in following through on critical reform measures. Sweeping and more decisive regulatory reforms are needed to ensure economic growth and open opportunities to all Tunisians.
For the United States, Tunisia’s embrace of democracy makes the country a critical asset of untapped potential value. A steady and democratic Tunisia not only provides the U.S. with a strategic ally but also serves as a model for future democracies in the region.
Since the January 2011 revolution, the U.S. has committed more than $1.4 billion in aid to support Tunisia’s transition to democracy. U.S. assistance to Tunisia focuses on an array of targeted areas that include ensuring and enhancing internal and external security, promoting democratic practices and good governance, and supporting sustainable economic growth.
The success of Tunisia’s bottom-up pursuit of democracy and economic freedom will be a success for the United States, too. In a 2015 joint commentary, Kim R. Holmes of The Heritage Foundation and William B. Taylor of the Institute of Peace made the compelling case that Tunisia is a strategic partner in a region where stable, democratic allies are rare and critically needed.
That still rings true today. Effective and strategic partners work together to make hard choices in tackling big problems and driving significant changes.
The United States and Tunisia should continue to embrace their challenging yet rewarding partnership as the two counties move forward. The result can be a Tunisia that serves as an example of democracy for the larger Arab world.

"Jordan recently abolished a law that allowed men to avoid legal punishment for committing rape by marrying their victim. (Photo: iStock Photos)

Many Arab countries have legal provisions that allow men accused or convicted of rape to avoid punishment.
Often called “marry your rapist” laws, these provisions generally state that a rapist will not be prosecuted if he marries his victim. Proponents believe that these laws protect women from stigmas surrounding rape.
However, most people—including some Arab leaders—view them as a major human rights violation.
The specific “marry your rapist” provisions are generally found in cultures where a woman’s chastity is tied to the honor of her family. They are not isolated to the Muslim world, although some interpretations of Islamic law and social attitudes make them more common there.
In most of these countries, rape is significantly underreported and often considered to be the victim’s fault as much as the perpetrator’s. Individual countries’ criminal codes often reinforce this belief.
Some countries have provisions that require a woman to prove she was raped by having multiple male witnesses. Even more egregious, a woman can actually face charges for illicit sex even if it was proven that the act took place against her will.
In other countries, someone who rapes a child can avoid punishment by marrying the victim.
Despite these antiquated attitudes, Arab countries are increasingly re-examining their criminal codes, repealing the “marry your rapist” laws, and in some cases instituting harsher penalties for perpetrators.
This is largely due to internal social pressure. For example, Bahrain is currently considering removing its “rape clause” and introducing stricter punishments against rapists.
Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia have all repealed their versions of the law. Jordan and Lebanon are now the latest Arab countries to follow this growing trend.
Jordan, a pro-Western but socially conservative kingdom, debated the repeal of its marriage rape law—Article 308—for four years.
Wafa Bani Mustafa, a female member of Parliament, first proposed the abolition of Article 308 in December 2013. Her proposal ignited a campaign in the private sector that reached every district in the country.
Well-known academics, journalists, and activists all took part in the effort to repeal Article 308. Their work came to fruition when Jordan finally abolished the law in August.
The Lebanese Parliamentary Committee for Administration and Justice announced in December 2016 that Lebanon would move to abolish its version of the “marry your rapist” law, Article 522. Prime Minister Saad Hariri also expressed his support of repeal.
Not long after the announcement, Abaad MENA, a Lebanese nongovernmental organization, launched its official campaign, “A White Dress Doesn’t Cover the Rape.” Abaad MENA sought to raise awareness about the physical and psychological trauma that victims experience when they are forced to marry their rapist.
The Parliamentary Committee for Administration and Justice approved a proposed repeal of Article 522 in February. On Aug. 16, Lebanon officially abolished the law.
While there is still progress to be made regarding women’s legal protections, Jordan and Lebanon have taken a significant step forward in repealing and reforming their rape laws.
As public opinion evolves, more countries will be pressured to re-examine their criminal codes. Many, including Mustafa, remain hopeful. She believes that civil society will continue to play a key role in pressuring governments to change the law.
While social attitudes may evolve more slowly, legal change is a good first step.

President Donald Trump announced on Friday that the United States would not recertify the controversial Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran—commonly referred to as the “Iran nuclear deal.”
The controversial agreement has been under fire since President Barack Obama signed it in 2015. Critics have stated concerns that the deal did not do enough to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, something that threatens the security of the entire international community.
As Trump outlined in his strategy, Iran’s offences are not limited to its nuclear program. This is why he included countering Iranian aggression as one component of his four-point strategy.
Iran’s growing influence is a threat to regional stability and is harming U.S. allies. Since sanctions on Iran were lifted in 2016, Iran has enjoyed increased financial and economic influence, which it has since invested in destabilizing many of its neighbors.
In addition to having a nuclear program, here are four ways that Iran is increasingly destabilizing the Middle East.
1. Proxy wars and undermining of U.S. partners.
Iran has a long history of backing rebel groups and undermining established regional governments.
In Yemen, Iran is seeking to weaken Saudi Arabia’s influence by supporting the Houthi rebels against Saudi and Yemeni forces and against a Saudi-led Arab expeditionary force. The Houthis have carried out attacks on U.S. and U.S.-allied ships in the Red Sea with Iranian-supplied weapons.
Iran even threatened to take military action against Saudi Arabia.
2. Smuggling of weapons and soldiers.
Iran was able to capitalize on Iraq’s fight against ISIS and the instability that resulted. In particular, it has created transportation and logistical infrastructure to move soldiers and weapons through Iraq to its proxy forces in Syria and Lebanon.
Iran is doing the same in Yemen. One U.S. officer noted that Iran has provided Houthi fighters with a deadly arsenal of weaponry that has even been used to attack U.S.-allied ships in the Red Sea.
Iran has also recruited thousands of Afghan refugees and deployed them as armed volunteer forces to fight alongside President Bashar al-Assad’s troops in Syria.
3. Aligning with brutal regimes. 
The Syrian civil war has been bloody and brutal. Over half a million Syrians have been killed, and millions more are now displaced. Iran’s support for Assad is one of the key elements safeguarding his government’s survival.
Iran has dispatched senior military figures, deployed hundreds of Revolutionary Guard soldiers, and provided monetary, intelligence, training, communications, and weapons support to Assad, despite his gross human rights violations.
Iran’s allies include hostile nations like Russia, which has fought alongside Iranian forces and Assad in Syria, as well as Venezuela, which is falling apart under a corrupt, anti-Western government.
Iran’s support of the Palestinian Authority has encouraged a rise in Palestinian terrorism and confidence in one day replacing Israel with a unitary Palestinian state.
4. State-sponsored terrorism.
One of Iran’s most notorious evils is its funding of terrorism. The State Department lists Iran as the No. 1 state sponsor of terrorism, and for good reason.
For years, Iran has backed anti-Western groups like Hamas and Hezbollah, as well as proxy groups in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen that have worsened ongoing regional conflicts.
In the Gaza Strip, Hamas regularly carries out attacks on Israel by using Iranian-funded weaponry, and having benefitted from Iranian-funded training.
In Lebanon, Hezbollah broadcasts pro-Iranian news and carries out attacks on the Lebanese-Israeli border. Iranian-backed Hezbollah fighters in Syria have played a role in propping up the Assad regime.
Iran has also been accused of supporting the Taliban in Afghanistan—a relationship the country formalized in early 2014—and of refusing to punish senior al-Qaeda members.
Preventing the Iranian regime from obtaining nuclear capabilities is important, but that is not the only threat Iran poses to the region.
Iranian influence is expanding, and instead of slowing or preventing this expanding influence, provisions under the Iran nuclear deal have made it easier for Iran to negatively influence and destabilize the Middle East.
Trump’s refusal to recertify the deal could mark a turning point in Iran’s destructive influence.

For years, Yemen has been one of the world’s poorest countries.
Today, its economy is on the verge of collapse, infectious disease is rampant, and competing factions pose an existential threat to the country. A civil war has left Yemen in what some are calling the world’s “largest humanitarian crisis to date.”
After the Arab Spring protests forced former President Ali Abdullah Saleh out of power in 2012, he joined with rebels supported by Iran to overthrow his successor, current President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi.
Hadi, forced into exile in Saudi Arabia, made a comeback after a Saudi-led coalition intervened to support his government in 2015.
Although there are many actors involved, three major factions are now battling for control of Yemen: the current Hadi government (supported by an Arab coalition led by Saudi Arabia), the Houthi and Saleh-aligned rebels (largely backed by Iran), and al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (a terrorist group).
As the Hadi government and Houthi rebels struggle for control, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has capitalized on the instability and increased its presence and terror attacks. Other terrorist groups are also flourishing in Yemen’s chaos, including some who have pledged loyalty to the Islamic State.
In the midst of this brutal civil war and increased terrorism, Yemen’s civilians have withstood the worst of the conflict.
Here is a glimpse of just how devastating this war has been.
To put this situation into further perspective, consider that Yemen has a population of 27 million people. Approximately 18.8 million—69 percent of the country’s population—is in need of immediate humanitarian assistance.
Instability, security threats, and a lack of basic infrastructure have prevented aid organizations from helping.
The United States has an interest in not only helping to mitigate this humanitarian crisis but also to encourage a political settlement to end the war. What happens in Yemen could negatively affect regional stability and be disastrous for U.S. interests.
The fighting between the Houthi rebels and Hadi government is symbolic of a much larger struggle between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Iran sees this war as an opportunity to undermine Saudi influence in the Arab world and increase its own.
It is vital to U.S. interests that Iran’s influence be contained.
Yemen’s geo-strategic importance cannot be ignored either. The country borders two U.S. allies and sits at the convergence point of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, overlooking the Bab el Mandab Strait—a key trade route, particularly for oil.
A daily 4.7 million barrels of oil are transported through that strait. At its most narrow point, the Bab el Mandab is only 18 miles wide, meaning that ships must pass closely together, usually only two at a time.
Serious disruptions of this route could constrict the flow of Persian Gulf oil to Europe and the western hemisphere and raise world oil prices.
Recent reports about Houthi rebel attacks against U.S. and other ships off Yemen’s coast have raised concerns about maritime security in the Red Sea.
As the war continues and Iranian influence grows, Tehran may seek to expand its leverage by escalating the potential threat to ships passing through the waterways.
The war has been devastating for Yemen’s civilians and regional stability. The U.S. can encourage a political settlement, but it will be up to the Yemenis and larger Arab world to see it into fruition.
Any settlement will also be impossible until Iran stops stoking the fire with its support for the Houthis.
However, without a solution to end the fighting, Yemen’s humanitarian crisis will only get worse.

The Iraq-Saudi Arabia relationship, while historically rocky, appears to be on the mend.
Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990 prompted Saudi Arabia to close its border with Iraq. Since then, only Iraqi religious pilgrims have been allowed to cross once a year during the hajj season.
After 27 years, the two nations are now planning to reopen the border crossing for trade. This decision came shortly after the Saudi Cabinet’s announcement that it had established a joint trade commission with Iraq.
The Iraq-Saudi Arabia relationship has been marginally influenced by Iran’s shifting political situation. Prior to 1979, the Saudis were wary of Hussein and suspected him of supporting movements that were hostile to Saudi interests.
The Iranian Islamic Revolution of 1979 dramatically changed that relationship. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini’s rise to power and the Iranian decree of Islamic revolution incited fear among both the Iraqis and the Saudis pushing them into greater cooperation.
This cooperation continued during the Iran-Iraq War, when, though technically neutral, Saudi Arabia provided Iraq with financial assistance and energy security, even permitting the Iraqis to build a pipeline across Saudi Arabia to avoid Iranian attacks on ships carrying its oil exports.
However, the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait harmed Iraqi-Saudi relations. There was concern that Hussein’s armies would cross into Saudi Arabia’s northern border, which they eventually did before being repulsed.
The Saudis shut down their Baghdad embassy, cut diplomatic ties, and closed the border with Iraq. Saudi Arabia went on to oppose the United States’ invasion of Iraq in 2003 over concerns that it would benefit Iran and pose a future threat to regional stability and security.
Iran’s relationship with Iraq was particularly hostile until the removal of Hussein from power. Hussein’s regime was dominated by a secular Sunni minority running a predominantly Shiite country. In the eyes of revolutionary Iran, this was unacceptable.
Consequently, Iraq acted as a balancing power in the region for years up until Hussein’s ouster.
When the U.S. ousted Hussein after its invasion in 2003, leading to its replacement by a Shia-dominated government, Iran saw an opportunity to dominate its neighbor in such a way that Iraq would no longer be a military threat.
Today, growing Iranian influence is increasingly threatening regional stability in the Middle East. The current chaos and the rise of the Islamic State have created conditions allowing Iran to gain a significant foothold in the country.
Iran has created transportation and logistical infrastructure to move soldiers and weapons through Iraq to proxy forces in Syria and Lebanon. It has provided training and munitions to Iraqi militias and assisted in attacking U.S. troops.
Iran is backing the anti-Saudi, Houthi rebels in Yemen and has recently threatened military action against Saudi Arabia.
An Iran-friendly Iraq is bad news for Saudi Arabia.
Religious divisions between Shiite and Sunni populations are a predominant source of tensions in the Middle East. Iraq and Iran are both largely Shiite nations, while Saudi Arabia is Sunni with a Shia minority.
An Iraq-Iran alliance could further destabilize the region and pose a direct threat to the Saudis.
Saudi Arabia is attempting to counter Iranian influence by investing in its northern neighbor. Saudi Arabia appointed a nonresident ambassador to Iraq in 2012, and in 2016 reopened its Baghdad embassy. The Saudi ambassador to Iraq noted that the reopening would allow the countries to cooperate on anti-extremism efforts.
Additionally, the crown prince has agreed to examine other potential investments in the southern regions of Iraq.
Now, Saudi Arabia is reopening its 506-mile border with Iraq. This action signifies Saudi Arabia’s commitment to preventing an Iranian hegemon in the region, and it marks an effort to improve ties between Saudi Arabia’s Sunni government and its Shiite-dominated neighbor to the north.
In a surprising event, the influential Shiite, Iraqi cleric Muqtada al-Sadr travelled to Riyadh to meet with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The meeting resulted in Saudi Arabia agreeing to donate $10 million in aid to the Iraqi government.
Sadr has long commanded a large following of Iraq’s poorer populations and has been an anti-American, Iranian ally for most of the post-Hussein era. But his recent outreach to the Saudis could signal a positive breakthrough in not only Saudi-Iraq relations but Arab Sunni-Shiite relations as well.
The time is ripe for Saudi Arabia to build positive diplomatic relationships with Iraqi leaders and politicians. As the Islamic State loses power, Iraq will be looking to restore stability to its people.
Saudi Arabia will play an important role in both strengthening Iraq and maintaining greater regional stability if both sides allow this relationship to progress.

"Under the misleading guise of being a British company, a firm connected to a Russian oligarch is seeking to expand its investments and business dealings across the United States.  
Only
a few months after Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska’s companies were
scandalously removed from U.S. sanctions, they have wasted no time trying to
enter the U.S. market. 
No matter how enticing the foreign investment might be for some states, they should be extremely cautious when dealing with Russian companies—especially those connected to the Kremlin.  
Anything
linked to Deripaska should be a concern, as he is steeped in controversy.   
A billionaire several times over, he enjoys close connections inside the Kremlin. While his companies were removed from sanctions, he personally remains listed. He has a long history of confrontation with American authorities. In the past decade, he was denied a business visa to the United States and was named a person of interest in the federal investigation into Russian meddling in U.S. elections. 
Despite all that, in January, the Office of Foreign Assets Control decided to lift sanctions on two of his companies, aluminum giant Rusal and its parent company, En+ Group. 
There was bipartisan shock within the U.S. foreign policy establishment. Several Republican senators, including Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Cory Gardner of Colorado, Marco Rubio of Florida, and Susan Collins of Maine expressed their displeasure with the decision. 
Since
the sanctions were lifted, Deripaska’s lackeys have wasted no time in seeking
to expand business into the U.S.
It’s
been reported that Rusal will
invest in a $1.7 billion aluminum mill in Kentucky. It would have been
unthinkable that during the Cold War a Soviet aluminum company would have been
allowed to invest in the U.S. So how has that been able to happen today? 
There
are two main reasons.
First, it was a team of lawyers and lobbyists employed by Rusal and En+ Group that successfully persuaded the Office of Foreign Assets Control that Deripaska had relinquished control over those companies so they could be delisted. 
Heather
Conley, who served in President George W. Bush’s administration dealing with
European issues, perhaps described the situation the
best. 
“They
use our laws, our rules, our banks, our lawyers, our lobbyists—it’s a strategy
from within,” she said.
And it was successful. At the time the sanctions were lifted, Cotton remarked: “I don’t believe Deripaska will be denied operational control of these companies, and I therefore believe they should remain subject to sanctions.”
Second, Deripaska has been able to create an image of his Russian companies actually being respectable British entities. He hired former British minister and ex-Tory parliamentarian Greg Barker to serve as the chairman of En+ Group. 
Before entering politics, Barker had a questionable history going back to the 1990s, working for Russian oligarchs, including Roman Abramovich. 
When En+ Group was listed, amid controversy, on the London Stock Exchange in November 2017, Barker’s name gave a patina of respectability to investors. 
Last April, Barker sent
letters to eight state governors making the case as to how
their states could benefit from Rusal’s investment. But nowhere does the letter
even say that Rusal is Russian. 
Russia continues to prop up Syrian strongman Bashar Assad
and occupy huge chunks of Ukraine and Georgia. It has meddled in U.S. elections
and surely plans to do so again in the future. 
The idea that a major Russian aluminum company should be
allowed to invest in America’s heartland is very concerning. 
Last year, London’s Daily Telegraph reported that at least three suspected former Russian spies occupy key positions in Deripaska’s businesses, including En+ Group. Barker’s letters to state governors and Deripaska’s legal gymnastics that resulted in his companies getting delisted from U.S. sanctions should be major eye-openers for U.S. policymakers. 
At the end of the day, as massive Russian companies with global interests, Rusal’s and En+ Group’s investments in the United States should come under intense scrutiny. After all, in the case of Rusal, the aluminum it produces has helped build the Russian war machine we are seeing in action in places like Ukraine and Syria. 
U.S. governors need to enter into any deal with companies
like Rusal with their eyes wide open, knowing who they are really dealing with—not
some British lord, but a Russian oligarch intimately linked to Russian
President Vladimir Putin himself.

"No matter what President Donald Trump does, the Iran deal is likely dead on May 12.
That’s the deadline by which the president must decide whether he will keep the U.S. in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or Iran deal—a deal that seems more likely to give Iranians a patient path to nuclear weapons than secure any kind of peace long term.
Back in January, Trump said he will seek to secure a better deal with our European allies but that: “This is a last chance. In the absence of such an agreement, the United States will not again waive sanctions in order to stay in the Iran nuclear deal. And if at any time I judge that such an agreement is not within reach, I will withdraw from the deal immediately. No one should doubt my word.”
This statement leaves two choices: either the Europeans fail to come to some sort of agreement with the Trump administration to fix the flaws in the deal, resulting in the U.S. leaving the deal, or the Europeans agree to fix some of the flaws and then the Iranians leave.
Europe and the Iran Deal
Publicly, it seems that the rounds of talks with our European allies have not made much progress.
It does not seem there is an agreement with Europeans to fix the “original sin” of the Iran deal—the so called sunset clauses that allow key restrictions on items like uranium enrichment, centrifuge production, and international monitoring to expire after a certain number of years.
Agreement on addressing some of the other contentious aspects of the deal, namely the inability to curb Iran’s ballistic missile program, and the unconditional opening up of all its military facilities to international inspectors, seem remote.
If the president decides to leave the deal, it’s hardly the end of the world—or even bad. instead, it should be seen as a necessary step to confront one of the deadliest threats Americans, Israelis, and Gulf Arabs face. America’s European allies better be prepared for this.
Ultimately, the Iran deal is a fundamentally flawed agreement that gave Tehran massive sanctions relief up front—while only requiring it to make temporary and easily reversible concessions on its nuclear program.
Already, the Iran Deal Has Proved Ineffective
The deal has failed to live up to the original goal of the international community when talks with Tehran started: to stop Iran from ever getting nuclear weapons. Instead, at best, the current deal only delays it by 10-15 years.
And this is only the case assuming that Iran remains not cheating on the deal behind the scenes—something the international inspectors cannot unequivocally prove under the flawed terms of the deal. Yet nothing since 1979, when the ayatollahs took power during the Islamic revolution, has shown that Iran can be a trusted partner.
Key restrictions on Tehran’s nuclear activities expire after 10 years. Under the deal, Iran is given a green light to operate its covertly built, formerly illicit nuclear facilities and gradually expand its uranium enrichment program to an industrial scale. This legitimized Iran’s past nuclear cheating and paved the way for a patient path to nuclear weapons.
It is difficult to argue that the nuclear deal effectively advances U.S. goals when Iran publicly refuses to allow inspections of its military bases in violation of the terms of the deal, develops ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear warheads, and eagerly anticipates the expiration of key restrictions on its uranium enrichment activities.
Contrary to the promises of the Obama administration, the nuclear deal has not moderated Iran’s foreign policy. In fact, since the nuclear deal was sealed in 2015, Tehran has cashed in on the sanctions relief, invested heavily in terrorist proxies, and stepped up its hostile activities in the region. Today we see the evidence of this in Yemen, Syria, and Iraq.
Many Iranians Also Dislike the Deal
Perhaps it is a twist of geopolitical irony that, like many Americans, many Iranians are unhappy with the deal, too. The economic windfall, which many were hoping for, has not trickled down to the average person, a frustration evident during the December/January protests that rocked the country.
Instead of going to average Iranians, the billions of dollars of unfrozen assets and sanctions relief have been used to fund Iran’s military adventures around the region. The international banking sector is still put off by the poor investment environment in Iran.
The truth is the only country that can save the deal is Iran. With fragmented leadership, a tanking economy, and deep unpopularity, maybe Tehran will decide that it is in its own self-interest to pull back on its destabilizing foreign policy and threats to renew nuclear programs and save itself from itself.
In the year 570 AD, the year that the Prophet Muhammad was born, the Sassanian empire, the predecessor of modern-day Iran, had its first foray into Yemen. Today, almost 1,500 years later, Iran is meddling in Yemen again. It is through the lens of this long history that Iran sees its future—and this is something the West fails to understand.
This is why the sunset clauses in the Iran nuclear agreement are so dangerous. This “original sin” of the agreement is based on the hope that Iran’s behavior will change between now and when certain prohibitions expire—but this is an assumption that has no basis in recent history or reality. A breakout period of 15-20 years to achieve a nuclear weapon is merely a blink of an eye for Iran’s leaders.
Trump needs to ask himself one very simple question on May 12: Does the Iran deal stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons forever?
If the answer is no, then he must walk away.

"Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2014 with the use of so-called “little green men” and Moscow’s subsequent meddling in elections across the transatlantic community, “hybrid warfare” has become the term du jour in Western foreign policy circles. 
Perhaps the best definition of hybrid warfare is offered by the new European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats, which describes it as “coordinated and synchronized action that deliberately targets democratic states’ and institutions’ systemic vulnerabilities, through a wide range of means (political, economic, military, civil, and information),” and “activities [that] exploit the thresholds of detection and attribution, as well as the border between war and peace.”
The aim, the Helsinki-based center says, is to
“influence different forms of decision-making at the local (regional), state,
or institutional level to favor and/or gain the agent’s strategic goals while
undermining and/or hurting the target.”
Of course, cyberattacks, economic warfare, energy
warfare, and the use of “little green men” are all crucial components of
Russia’s strategy. Its most effective tool is probably its propaganda and influence
operations in the form of dubious nongovernmental organizations and the funding
of political parties. 
Moscow is very active in the nongovernmental organization world, showing a tendency to fund those organizations and think tanks in the U.S. and Europe to advance its energy, strategic, and political goals. Russia has funded shell organizations and fake think tanks that promote anti-fracking messages in the U.S. and Romania. 
In a story first reported by The Daily Signal in 2017, the chairman of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee wrote to the Treasury secretary to complain about a dubious nonprofit called Sea Change with links to Russian money and pushing an anti-fracking agenda in the U.S. 
In 2014, the secretary-general of NATO accused
Russia of doing the same thing in Romania.  
In Georgia, a nation under constant Russian pressure,
Moscow constantly sows division in society by funding nongovernmental
organizations—the founders and managers of which are often
the same people. 
Just recently, in a report in the United Kingdom’s Sunday Times, the Brussels-based Open Dialogue Foundation was accused of working with Russian security services and of receiving funding from Moscow to spread misinformation in countries that opposed the Kremlin’s policies. 
The Kremlin link was dismissed by the foundation, but considering its past support for dubious individuals (for example, convicted fraudster Mukhtar Ablyazov and Uzbek-born businessman Nail Malyutin, who is currently in prison and who has close links to organized crime), it’s not surprising that people question its wider motives.
According to another Sunday Times report, 1.5 million pounds (more than $1.8 million) from offshore areas of “dubious, unknown routes and origins” were sent to the accounts of two firms in Britain and ended up in the bank account of the Open Dialogue Foundation, which was allegedly used to fund lobbying campaigns. Its director, Lyudmyla Kozlovska, was even banned from traveling in much of the European Union by Poland last year.
Russia also expands its reach through the attempted funding
and influencing of political parties.  
An investigation last month uncovered a plot between an associate of Matteo Salvini, the leader of the far-right populist Italian Lega party, and Russian businessmen to covertly fund the Lega’s election campaigning.
Prosecutors in Milan, Italy, have since started an investigation into the latter. Salvini, who also serves as Italy’s deputy prime minister, holds Moscow-friendly views on contentious issues, such as Russia’s annexation of Crimea. 
Another example of Moscow’s reach is the troublesome ideological and financial connection between Russia and Marine Le Pen, leader of France’s far right National Rally party (formally known as the National Front). Le Pen’s positions often mirror those of the Kremlin—whether it’s calling Syrian President Bashar Assad “the most reassuring solution for France” or backing the Russian takeover and occupation of Crimea.
During the most recent French presidential elections, Le Pen met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, a curious thing to do at a time when France had joined other European countries to slap economic sanctions on Russia.
Meanwhile, her party is still trying to pay off a loan
worth $12.2
million from a small—and now defunct—Russian bank.
So, as the international community is focused on the
Russian war machine in Syria or eastern Ukraine, or the illegal occupation of
Crimea and Abkhazia, policymakers cannot ignore the softer aspects of Russia’s
war against the West. 
So, how do we make our societies more resilient against
Russia’s influence operations and propaganda? 
The most important thing to do is to deny Russia the fertile soil in which to sow the seeds of instability. That can be done in three ways.   
First, establish good governance on the local and
national level. If people think they are being governed fairly and governed
well, then they become less susceptible to Russian disinformation and
propaganda efforts. 
Second, there must be economic freedom. People need to believe
they have economic stability and that their children have a bright economic
future. 
Finally, there must be a bond of trust and respect
between the average person and their nation’s law enforcement and intelligence
services. If people believe they are being policed fairly and that intelligence
services are not overstepping their bounds, then society will become more
resilient against Russian hybrid tactics.

"Anybody in the inner circle of Russian strongman Vladimir Putin who might have cheered President Donald Trump’s victory in 2016 must now be sorely disappointed.
When it comes to dealing with Russia, Trump has been the toughest president since Ronald Reagan. He has sent advanced weapons to the Ukrainians and Georgians, increased U.S. defense spending in Europe, enlarged NATO, kicked out scores of Russian diplomats, and recently announced that the U.S. will withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.
But perhaps Trump’s biggest impact has been with economic sanctions. He has slapped them on more than 200 Russian oligarchs and senior government officials and dozens of Russian organizations and companies.
These measures strike at the kleptocratic heart of Putin’s inner circle—and they are starting to bite. How do we know? Because Russian companies under U.S. sanctions are trying to find creative ways of getting off the sanctions list.
Leading the charge is Russian aluminum giant Rusal, owned by Putin crony Oleg Deripaska. In August, Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin implied that sanctions against Rusal could be lifted if Deripaska, who is personally sanctioned by the U.S. government, shows he is no longer the company’s majority shareholder.
Several days after Mnuchin’s comments, Deripaska’s team of attorneys submitted a plan to the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the division inside the Treasury Department that would decide whether he actually has ceded control of the company.
Last week, Rusal missed a deadline to show that it had satisfactorily restructured its ownership to meet U.S. concerns. Astonishingly, instead of saying “Sorry, too little, too late” to Deripaska and his attorneys, Treasury gave them more time to make their case.
This is an incredibly high-profile case, and Treasury’s wobbliness has led other Russian companies to believe they can also restructure their ownership to get off the U.S. sanctions list, too.
Last week, it was announced that Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg, who owns the Renova Group—a massive conglomerate with business interests in the energy, construction and telecommunications sectors—was going to appeal to the Office of Foreign Assets Control to lift the sanctions put on him and his business interests.
If the office lifts sanctions on Rusal or the Renova Group, it would be the first crack in the sanctions regime since the Obama administration introduced it 2014. It would send the wrong signals to friend and foe alike.
Letting the likes of Deripaska and Vekselberg off the hook because of their dubious “business restructuring” gambit would set an army of Russian lawyers to working overtime to get other firms off the sanctions list, too.
Many of America’s allies in Europe are watching what the Treasury does, too. Sadly, some of them with uncomfortably close relations with Moscow are looking for the first excuse to reduce their sanctions against Russia. The Treasury should not become that first excuse.
At the end of the day, as massive Russian companies with global interests, Rusal and the Renova Group should remain sanctioned even if their respective owners give up all control. After all, in the case of Rusal, the aluminum it produces has helped build the Russian war machine we are seeing in action in places like Ukraine and Syria. So it hardly matters if Deripaska has a controlling stake or not.
It should come as no surprise that Russian companies are trying to get off the sanctions list. Russian companies, like companies around the world, have a responsibility to their shareholders to deliver profits. Obviously, being on the U.S. sanctions list is bad for business. However, the administration needs to realize that it, too, has a responsibility to its shareholders—the American people.
Until Russia changes its behavior on the international stage—stops occupying Crimea, ends its support for Syrian dictator Bashar Assad, and stops its support of separatists in eastern Ukraine—it remains in America’s interest to keep the sanctions in place.

"Just 72 hours after the election of former actor and comedian
Volodymyr Zelenskiy as Ukraine’s next president, Russian President Vladimir Putin
has given him his first geopolitical challenge. 
Putin signed
a decree on Wednesday stating that those who live in the parts
of Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions that are currently controlled by
Moscow-backed separatists will be issued Russian passports.
Ukraine’s newly elected president was quick to
criticize Putin’s decree. He suggested that
Ukraine should instead issue Ukrainian passports “to all people who suffer from authoritarian
and corrupt regimes,” first and foremost “to the Russian people who
suffer most of all.” 
Putin’s recent action should come as no surprise. Moscow has been issuing Russian passports to citizens of other former Soviet countries for years. 
This policy of “passportization” is completely in line with Putin’s foreign policy mentality. During his 2005 State of the Nation address to the Russian parliament, Putin infamously said, “We should acknowledge that the collapse of the Soviet Union was the major geopolitical disaster of the 20th century.”
In that same speech, he also said: “For the Russian nation, [the collapse of
the USSR] became a genuine drama. Tens of millions of our co-citizens and
compatriots found themselves outside Russian territory.” 
Under Putin’s leadership, Russia has designated itself the protector of
these ethnic Russians—no matter where in the world they may be. 
Moscow has long embraced this “protector of ethnic Russians” status under Putin—formally known as the Compatriot Policy—and all levels of his government have followed suit. 
Putin’s
most recent passport decree is also nothing new. 
In
2002, approximately
150,000 people
living the Georgian region of Abkhazia were granted Russian citizenship. This
foreshadowed Moscow’s actions in 2008, when Russia invaded Georgia. At this time,
Russian passports were handed out in the Georgian
regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. 
After
seeing this take place, Ukrainian officials were nervous that Russia might
issue passports to its citizens in Crimea. That fear became a reality in 2014,
when Russian forces invaded and annexed Crimea and granted Russian citizenship to
everyone living there. 
So,
looking at Putin’s track record, his passport decree on Wednesday was a
predictable next step. 
In the middle of the 19th century, British
Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston said of Russia:  
The policy and practice of the Russian government has always been to push forward its encroachments as fast and as far as the apathy or want of firmness of other governments would allow it to go, but always to stop and retire when it met with decided resistance and then to wait for the next favorable opportunity.
Looking at recent actions in Ukraine, it
seems that what was true of Imperial Russia is true of Putin’s Russia. 
Russia has been able to exploit its
neighbors’ vulnerability to its own benefit, calculating that the West won’t
respond in any significant way. 
As Lord Palmerston knew so well, Russia
will do what it knows it can get away with. No more and no less. 
Putin’s move to issue passports in eastern Ukraine is a
clear affront to Ukraine’s sovereignty. It is also a test for the new Ukrainian
president.  
Most importantly, though, this cavalier decision by
Moscow shows that those running the Kremlin do not want better relations with
the West. 
Western leaders should not believe otherwise.

"Alexis Mrachek
/
@AlexisMrachek

Alexis Mrachek is a research assistant for Russia and Eurasia at The Heritage Foundation.
On Friday, in his meeting with the Group of Seven countries, President Donald Trump proposed that Russia be able to rejoin the G-7.
Russian President Vladimir Putin would need to do much to re-qualify for that privilege, since Russia still retains its hold on Crimea and maintains troops in eastern Ukraine. After all, these are the very reasons Russia was originally ousted from the group in March 2014.
The G-7 comprises seven of the world’s advanced industrialized economies. They are also all democracies. These same countries happen to be America’s close allies, too—Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom. The group meets annually to discuss issues such as shared global security and economic matters.
Over four years ago, Russia actually was part of the group, which then was known as the G-8. Russia first joined the G-8 in 1997 when Boris Yeltsin was still in power. Back then, Western relations with Russia looked promising, so it made perfect sense for the eight countries to align.
However, when Russia decided in March 2014 to illegally annex Crimea and invade the Donbas region of Ukraine, it proved it was no longer a trustworthy actor on the international stage. Thus, the G-8 removed Moscow and reverted back to the G-7.
On Friday, Trump suggested that Russia should be readmitted into the group. But before this can happen, at a minimum Russia must do the following:
In May 2018, Russia was found responsible for the tragedy but Putin denies it. In addition to owning up, Russia must formally apologize to and suitably compensate the families of those who lost loved ones in the incident.
The G-7 is an organization that allows like-minded democracies to work together to tackle many of the world’s major problems. Putin has not demonstrated that he can be a trusted partner, and Trump is wrong to say that Russia should now be allowed back in the club.
However, if Russia changes its ways, it should be invited back into the G-7. Russia is a proud country. For better or for worse, it possesses a history of being at the center of global affairs. But it can only re-enter the G-7 once it demonstrates that it is a responsible and collegiate actor on the international stage.
Sadly, this is unlikely to occur while Putin is in power. The Russian people will continue to suffer, and Russian influence on the international stage will continue to be marginalized.

"With each successful Taliban attack, the inevitable headlines appear about America’s failures in Afghanistan.
That’s why, as President Donald Trump reviews his Afghan policy this summer, it is important that he does not start seeing every tactical victory of the Taliban as America’s strategic defeat.
Overall, good progress has been made in Afghanistan, and Trump should remain committed to the strategy he outlined last year.
After the 9/11 attacks, there were two main goals in Afghanistan: First, to deny al-Qaeda a safe haven from which to plan, train, and launch terrorist attacks on a global scale, and second, to remove the Taliban regime from power as punishment for not cooperating with the international community and for harboring terrorism.
Both were accomplished with relative speed.
As the years went by, the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan was defined around the quixotic goals of creating “a strong central government” and a “pluralistic society.”
We have tried accomplishing these goals by “holding free and fair” elections, “tackling corruption,” and building the “institutions of democracy.”
That created an impossible situation for the U.S. military. With the lofty goals of nation-building defining our success in the early days, the only thing most people see today in Afghanistan is failure.
Far from having failed in Afghanistan, the U.S. and its allies have delivered considerable progress in Afghanistan.
After the successful targeting of Taliban leaders, combined with a robust counterinsurgency campaign over the years, the Taliban as a national movement has degenerated into several smaller, weaker, and localized insurgencies—each with a different set of grievances and goals.
Even with the recent horrific attacks in Kabul, the level of violence in Afghanistan is nowhere close to its peak.
Al-Qaeda, which once used Afghan territory with impunity, no longer enjoys a safe haven in Afghanistan. The threat posed to Afghanistan by the Islamic State is not even close to being in the same league as the Taliban, and pales in comparison to the terrorist group’s other affiliates in Syria, Libya, and Yemen.
No major terrorist attack originating from Afghanistan has been successful in the United States since 2001.
The Taliban that rolled into Kandahar and Kabul in the mid-1990s with tanks and planes is a shadow of its former self today.
In 2001, outside of a small rump of territory run by the Northern Alliance in northeast Afghanistan, the Taliban controlled 90 percent of the entire country. Today, according to the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction’s most recent quarterly report to Congress, the Taliban has “control or influence” in an area equaling only 13 percent of the country’s population.
By contrast, 65 percent of Afghanistan’s population live under the “control or influence” of the Afghan government. The remaining 22 percent of the population lives in “contested” areas.
That is not bad. Al-Qaeda is essentially gone. ISIS is unable to establish a meaningful foothold in the country. The once omnipresent Taliban has been relegated to a divided and disparate insurgency.
Even so, there is a constant drumbeat of articles and commentary talking about America’s failure in Afghanistan. It is unclear what would make these critics of the Afghan war happy. Would they be happy when only 10 percent of Afghanistan’s population was under Taliban control? Five percent? None?
After almost 17 years of warfare, maybe we should come to terms with the fact that until there is a genuine political settlement between all warring parties, and until Pakistan stops providing succor to the Taliban, what we see in Afghanistan might be as good as it’s going to get.
The American public has every reason to be proud of what the U.S. military has accomplished under very challenging circumstances in Afghanistan.
It is time that we have a dose of realism of what to expect in Afghanistan and lower our expectations on what is achievable for the future. Afghanistan will not be perfect or suddenly become some Switzerland in the Hindu Kush.
Unless you are some idealistic dreamer who has never stepped foot in the country, that was never the goal.
Success will be achieved when there is a stable enough Afghanistan—that is, when it is able to manage its own internal and external security to a degree that stops interference from outside powers, allowing the country to resist the re-establishment of terrorist bases that were there before. Nothing more and nothing less.
The immediate criticism of Trump’s strategy last year was based on the argument that 4,000 more trainers will not be able to do in 2018 what more than 100,000 U.S. troops were unable to do in 2011.
But this argument stems from an old way of thinking about America’s role in Afghanistan. The war being fought in Afghanistan today is not the same war as in 2001 or even 2009 (the year President Barack Obama unveiled his Afghan strategy), when the U.S. was leading combat operations.
Today, the Afghans are in the lead, and the U.S. mission is one of training, advising, and assisting.
The Afghan security forces are that country’s ticket to long-term security and stability. If the U.S. and its allies continue to mentor, train, and fund the Afghan military, the Afghans will be able to do a better job at taking on the insurgency themselves.
Not only will that help the Afghans prevent their country from becoming a hub for transnational terrorism, but it also will eventually establish the security conditions in which a genuine political process can take place. That latter point is the most important.
In his speech last year when announcing his new strategy, Trump alluded to an eventual political settlement “after an effective military effort.” That is right. You can no more fight your way out of a insurgency campaign any more than you can drink yourself out of alcoholism.
The goal of any counterinsurgency is to allow those who have legitimate political grievances the ability to address these grievances through a political process and not through violence.
If the insurgency in Afghanistan ever ends, it will be through a political settlement between the Afghan government and the Taliban.
As Trump makes a decision later this summer about the future of the U.S. role in Afghanistan, he needs to start measuring success by achievements on the ground and not by unrealistic expectations.
The president should drown out the constant criticism of the campaign and remain committed to the realistic, reasonable, and responsible strategy he outlined last year.
Afghanistan is a complex place. There is a huge space between victory and defeat. That is where we are today—and where we will likely be for the foreseeable future.
That does not mean we have failed. That is simply reality.

"As the territorial integrity of ISIS’ “caliphate” in Iraq and Syria erodes, the terror group now finds itself looking to its contingent group in Afghanistan, known as the Islamic State in Khorasan, or IS-K, in order to maintain its operations.
In the northern Afghan province of Jowzjan, IS-K has been actively recruiting fighters associated with al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan.
But the terror groups in Afghanistan are hardly unified. As ISIS makes inroads there, competition among various groups is emerging, with each seeking to tap into a common pool of militants.
This growth of militant organizations makes the Trump administration’s new aggressive strategy all the more vital.
A key part of this strategy dates back to the original U.S. mission from 2001: denying terrorists a safe haven from which to plot terrorist attacks. It also includes the more recent measure of holding Pakistan accountable for the role it has played in destabilizing the region.
One of the most critical changes in the new strategy is the removal of cumbersome, Obama-era restrictions on the use of U.S. air power.
Under the Obama administration, the U.S. only allowed the use of airstrikes when U.S. or coalition forces were under imminent attack. Now, under the new policy, commanders on the ground have broader authority to use airstrikes as they see fit.
The effects of this change have already produced an obvious result.
From the time the Afghan strategy was unveiled in August 2017 to Dec. 31, 2017, the U.S. carried out around 2,000 airstrikes against the Taliban and associated groups. This is nearly as many airstrikes as in all of 2015 and 2016 combined. Almost one-quarter of these strikes (455) occurred in December, compared with a mere 65 in the same time period the year before.
On a related note, in November 2017, U.S. and coalition forces conducted joint operations that produced a devastating result against Taliban drug labs. These joint operations destroyed at least 25 labs and have reportedly cost the Taliban upward of $20 million in lost revenue.
In the most recent development, which occurred on April 9 of this year, one of Afghanistan’s most powerful warlords—Qari Hekmatullah—was killed in the northern Afghan province of Fayab by a U.S. airstrike. Hekmatullah was previously a member of the Taliban, but departed in favor of leading the northern branch of IS-K.
After switching allegiances, Hekmatullah had survived several Taliban attempts to oust him from northern Afghanistan. Hekmatullah proved resilient against those attempts and continued to play a critical role in recruiting militants for IS-K.
Hekmatullah’s death comes at a time of renewed military pressure on IS-K from both Afghan and U.S. special operations forces. According to NATO, these factors have reduced IS-K to an isolated group devoid of leadership.
This new Afghan strategy is a breath of fresh air in what is now America’s longest war. This new approach may be exactly what is required not only to prevent ISIS from establishing itself in the country, but to break past the security stalemate that has characterized this conflict for so long.
The Trump administration should measure its success in Afghanistan incrementally, based on conditions on the ground and with an eye toward the future. As a Taliban commander once mused, “You [the West] have the watches, but we have the time.”
We would be wise to consider that statement and disavow any lofty, short-term expectations in favor of a realistic outlook that embraces the true, protracted nature of America’s longest war.

"Thomas Spoehr

Thomas W. Spoehr, a retired Army lieutenant general, is director of the Center for National Defense at The Heritage Foundation.

Walter Lohman

Walter Lohman is Director of The Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center.
There have been recent media reports that up to 7,000 U.S. troops, roughly half of the number of troops there, will be removed from Afghanistan. There has been no official statement from the Trump administration confirming this and it is important to stress that senior officials are saying privately that no final decision has been taken.
After more than 17 years of a U.S. military presence in Afghanistan it is only natural to question the value of the mission. However, most of the criticism about the mission today comes from failing to see the mission for what it now is: a training, advising, and assisting mission for the Afghanistan National Defense and Security Forces (ANSDF).
Today, we are not dealing with the same situation in Afghanistan as in 2001 right after the U.S. invaded and ousted the Taliban. We are also not facing the same Afghanistan as in 2009 when President Barack Obama announced his surge policy and increased U.S. troops to its peak of 100,000 leading day-to-day combat operations.
Today there is a relatively small contingent of about 14,000 U.S. troops—the vast majority of which are training and mentoring the ANSDF. It is true that a small number of these troops are conducting high-end special operations missions to target senior Taliban leadership, remnants of al-Qaeda, and the nascent Islamic State of the Khorasan Province. But these missions are the exception rather than the rule.
A training mission coupled with a high-end special operations mission is something the U.S. does in countless countries around the world. It is through the lens of a training mission that we should see the U.S. presence in Afghanistan today, not as an extension of the war that has been raging since 2001.
In addition to misunderstanding what kind of mission the U.S. is performing in Afghanistan, there is an extreme pessimism regarding what has been accomplished in Afghanistan.
The New York Times recently reported that “the Taliban are stronger than ever.” This is pure sensationalism that is totally divorced from the reality. The Taliban today is nothing like the Taliban in 1996 when it rolled into Kandahar and Kabul and operated tanks and flew planes.
On Sept. 10, 2001, the Taliban controlled 90 percent of the entire country outside a small rump in northeastern Afghanistan controlled by the Northern Alliance. During this time all major road networks, all of the major population centers, and the capital city Kabul were under Taliban control.
The situation could not be more different today.
According to the most recent report from the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction—hardly known for sugar coating the situation in Afghanistan—the Taliban “controls or influences” areas where only 10.5 percent of Afghanistan’s population live (a 1.5 percent decrease from the previous quarter’s report).
Conversely, the Afghan government “controls or influences” areas where 65 percent of the Afghanistan population resides. The Taliban has not come close to retaking Kabul. In fact, in recent years, the Taliban has only been able to hold parts of a district center on two occasions and only for a few days at a time before being expelled.
Yes, the Taliban might successfully raid an Afghan army base. It might successfully detonate a suicide bomber in Kabul, killing scores. On occasion it might hold parts of a district center for a few days. But we need to stop treating every tactical victory of the Taliban’s as America’s strategic defeat.
There is a huge space between victory and defeat and that is where the U.S. is today in Afghanistan and that is where the U.S. is likely to remain for the foreseeable future. Until there is a genuine peace settlement between all Afghans, and until Pakistan stops providing succor to the Taliban, we should accept that this is as good as it is going to get. This is not defeat. This is reality.
We should also stop using vague notions of nation building to judge our progress in Afghanistan. We are there to help create a stable enough Afghanistan so it can manage its own internal security without the presence of tens of thousands of foreign troops helping it. Nothing more. Nothing less. This way the Afghans can stop their country from becoming a hub for transnational terrorism like it was before 2001. This will also help bring stability to an increasingly important region of the world.
A crucial part of accomplishing this goal is the training mission. We saw what happened when Obama abruptly withdrew the U.S. training mission in Iraq in December 2011. Only two years later ISIS had taken Mosul and was knocking on the gates of Baghdad. For the sake of 14,000 trainers in Afghanistan, now is not the time to needlessly repeat the pricy mistakes of the past in Iraq.
There is also the political process to consider. The objective of any counterinsurgency is to give those people who have legitimate political grievances the ability to address these grievances through political process and not through violence. After all, most successful counterinsurgency operations end with negotiated settlement.
This is why the news coming out of the latest rounds of talks in Abu Dhabi is welcome. Hopefully, representatives of the Taliban will soon meet with officials from the Afghan government to start meaningful talks about bringing peace to Afghanistan after decades of war. The U.S. should support this process along the way but remain skeptical of the Taliban’s motives.
The Taliban needs to prove that it is serious about talks because nothing in the past has shown it is a trustworthy actor. Withdrawing U.S. troops from Afghanistan—unless it was part of a broader confidence-building measure connected to the peace talks and coordinated with the Afghan government—could derail the talks before they get off to a meaningful start.
A capable ANDSF and a genuine political settlement led by the Afghans is the country’s best ticket to prosperity and America’s best hope for regional stability and security. This is why it is in America’s interest to continue with the training, advising in assisting mission in Afghanistan.
Now is not the time to abandon the Afghans and repeat the mistakes of Iraq.

"The recent media reports that President Donald Trump is interested in purchasing Greenland for the United States has brought the unlikely country into the world’s headlines.
Taking advantage of the limelight, Greenland’s government tweeted, “We’re open for business, not for sale.” 
#Greenland is rich in valuable resources such as minerals, the purest water and ice, fish stocks, seafood, renewable energy and is a new frontier for adventure tourism. We're open for business, not for sale??????? learn more about Greenland on: https://t.co/WulOi3beIC
Buying options aside, this newfound attention—however short-lived—can only be positive for Greenland.
Greenland is a very important U.S. partner with a long and rich history. It was first discovered by Vikings in the 10th century, and was ruled by the Kingdom of Denmark and Norway until 1814. That year, the Treaty of Kiel transferred ownership to the Kingdom of Denmark after the union between Norway and Denmark ended. 
Geographically, and to a certain extent culturally,
Greenland is part of North America—although much of its economic and historical
links are with Europe.
Today, Greenland is an autonomous
constituent country of the Kingdom of Denmark. Greenland was granted home rule
in 1979 and self-government
in 2009. It has competency over most policy areas, with the big exceptions
being foreign affairs, defense, and monetary policy—all of which are still
controlled by Copenhagen. 
There is a strong desire in Greenland for full
independence—especially among Greenland’s political elite. Only one political
party does not support independence (and that party holds only one seat in the
31-seat parliament). 
For Greenland, the question is not if it will become
independent, but when and how. 
Few inside Greenland’s government think it is ready now,
but Denmark’s official position is that Greenland can become independent
whenever it pleases.
After Germany invaded Denmark in 1940, the U.S. quickly
deployed forces to protect Greenland from Nazi Germany. Ever since, the U.S.
has maintained a military presence on the island. 
In 1946, the Truman administration tried, unsuccessfully,
to
buy the entire island from Denmark for $100 million. The U.S. was, however,
granted long-term access to important military sites. 
Today, the main U.S. military presence is at Thule Air Base
in the north of the country. Thule also serves as a very important early
warning radar and satellite tracking station for the protection of the U.S.
homeland.
So while the U.S.-Greenland security relationship is already
good, U.S. policymakers should use the president’s newfound interest in
Greenland to advance closer economic relations with the country and expand
America’s diplomatic presence there.
Greenland has surprisingly few economic links with North America, given its geographical proximity. 
For instance, there are currently no direct flights from
the U.S. to Greenland. The few direct flights that existed in the past were not
profitable. The fishing industry accounts for 95% of Greenland’s exports, but
only 1% of that goes to the U.S. 
Greenland is making a conscious effort to change this
lack of connection with North America. Greenland’s national sea carrier, Royal
Arctic Line, will be starting
a weekly shipping service to Portland, Maine, later this year, and
Greenland’s government has been meeting with Maine government officials about
increasing economic links. 
The only way to fly commercially to Greenland is from Iceland or Denmark, but that could change in the coming years. Greenland is set to begin construction on three new airports this year, to be finished in 2023 (in Qaqortoq, in the south; in Nuuk, the capital; and in Ilulissat, in the north). 
Greenland’s government hopes the new airports will allow direct flights from North America and open up new opportunities for business and tourism.
The U.S. is also making new initiatives. 
After years of putting it on the back burner, the Trump administration recently announced that the U.S. will maintain a part-time diplomatic presence in Greenland. This is something The Heritage Foundation has been calling for. While this is a very welcome first step, over time this should become an enduring and permanent presence. 
The U.S. once had a consulate in Greenland, from 1940 to the early 1950s. Greenland is in America’s backyard and a critical part of America’s security architecture. 
An expanded U.S. diplomatic presence would demonstrate
that the U.S. takes Greenland at a level of seriousness proportionate to its
role in America’s security. It would also give the U.S. government a depth of
situational awareness not possible without a consulate.
In all the hubbub over whether or not Trump really wants
to buy Greenland, there’s been very little discussion about whether that would
be a good idea even if it were possible. In particular, nobody is discussing the
financial burden that being responsible for Greenland would place on the U.S. 
Approximately 55% of the Greenlandic government’s budget currently comes from Denmark in the form of a block grant. Moreover, no two cities or towns in Greenland are connected by a road, making travel and economic activity very difficult and expensive. And, many of the same social problems found in similar remote communities in Alaska are also found in Greenland, such as alcoholism and high suicide rates. 
As things currently stand, none of these costs could be
offset by the profitable exploitation of natural resources as some suggest. The
harsh environmental conditions and the lack of transport infrastructure limits
the ability to take advantage of Greenland’s natural resources. 
While there’s been much talk of Greenland’s mineral and
natural resources, the fact is that there are currently only two active mines
in Greenland: the Aappaluttoq ruby mine and the Qaqortorsuaq anorthosite mine.
Neither are swimming in profit.  
To put it simply, the U.S. doesn’t need to buy Greenland. A country like ours that is drowning in $22.5 trillion in national debt must prioritize its spending. 
The U.S. is already able to leverage its great relationship with Greenland and Denmark, and the U.S. enjoys access to Thule Air Base. Our strategic interests can be met without “purchasing” Greenland.  
It is impossible to know what Trump’s true opinion is on
Greenland one way or the other, but with his upcoming trip to Denmark, I am
sure this matter will be raised. 
In the end, who knows how much truth is in these media reports? After all, August is a slow month for media outlets. They could have been scrounging for “clicks.”
This is not the 19th century, and Greenland is not for sale. Regardless what the Greenlanders choose—either remaining with Denmark, or becoming an independent nation—the U.S. should respect Greenland’s right to self-determination and continue to deepen relations.
Ultimately, it is up to the people of Greenland to
determine how and by whom they wish to be governed.

"New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, here speaking Jan. 21 in Lower Manhattan, renewed a ban on fracking for natural gas in his state. Two environmental groups that favored the ban received millions from Russian-financed entities. (Photo: John Roca/Polaris/Newscom)
New Yorkers who are missing out on the natural gas revolution could be victims of Russian spy operations that fund popular environmental groups, current and former U.S. government officials and experts on Russia worry.
Natural gas development of the celebrated Marcellus Shale deposits has spurred jobs and other economic growth in neighboring Pennsylvania. But not in New York, which nearly 10 years ago banned the process of hydraulic fracturing, also known as fracking, to produce natural gas.
Two environmental advocacy groups that successfully lobbied against fracking in New York each received more than $10 million in grants from a foundation in California that got financial support from a Bermuda company congressional investigators linked to the Russians, public documents show.
The environmental groups Natural Resources Defense Council and the Sierra Club Foundation received millions of dollars in grants from the San Francisco-based Sea Change Foundation.
“Follow the money trail, and this [New York] ban on fracking could be viewed as an example of successful Russian espionage,” Ken Stiles, a CIA veteran of 29 years who now teaches at Virginia Tech, told The Daily Signal.
To Stiles and other knowledgeable observers, this looks like an actual case of knowing or unknowing collusion with Russia.
Both Natural Resources Defense Council and Sierra Club Foundation also accepted tens of millions from the Energy Foundation, the top recipient of grants from Sea Change, according to foundation and tax records.
When New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, renewed his state’s ban on fracking three years ago, the Natural Resources Defense Council issued a statement supporting the ban. So did the Sierra Club, the primary recipient of grants from its sister organization, the Sierra Club Foundation.
Environmental activists associated with the groups receiving Sea Change Foundation grants continued to pressure Cuomo and other public officials to maintain and expand New York’s fracking ban.
Most recently, the two environmental groups scored another victory when the Delaware River Basin Commission, an interstate regulatory agency that includes the governors of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware, proposed a ban on fracking within the Delaware River Basin cutting across all four states.
The Sierra Club and the Natural Resource Defense Council have pressed the regional commission to impose the ban, issuing statements (here and here) calling for  restrictions that are tighter than what the commission proposed.
PennEast Pipeline Co. is set to begin construction on a 120-mile-long pipeline to transport natural gas from the Marcellus Shale across Eastern Pennsylvania into New Jersey. In a new public relations campaign, PennEast asks New Jersey residents if they would rather obtain their energy from Pennsylvania or Russia.

PennEast cites media reports describing how anti-pipeline policies in Massachusetts forced the state into a position where it had to rely on Russian imports of liquified natural gas during peak cold periods this past winter.
The Russian Money Trail 
Government officials and environmental leaders have a responsibility to track the money, Stiles, the former CIA officer, told The Daily Signal in an interview.
“The Russians are very adept and skilled at making long-term investments,” Stiles said. “They sit back very patiently to see how their funding can pay off over a period of many years.”
Stiles added:
Whether these environmental groups realize it or not, they could be operating as what we [in the CIA] call ‘agents of influence.’ By working to block natural gas production, environmental activists are advancing policies that work to the advantage of Russia and to the disadvantage of America and America’s allies.
Logo of the Natural Resources Defense Council
 
Karen Moreau, who is in charge of the New York office of the American Petroleum Institute, a trade association for gas and oil companies, argues that the resulting policy hurts state residents and businesses.
“New York remains at a disadvantage because other states are not just more pro-energy, they are more pro-business and therefore pipelines that could have been constructed in New York taking gas from the Marcellus Shale are instead moving south, not north,” Moreau told The Daily Signal.
“The manufacturing renaissance that is taking place in this country thanks to the president’s policies is not happening in states like New York,” she said.
A senior adviser to the State Department told a recent conference that Trump administration policies supporting energy dominance could help the U.S. eclipse the amount of natural gas Russia exports to the European Union.
The Daily Signal unsuccessfully sought comment from the Sierra Club Foundation and its affiliate the Sierra Club, as well as Natural Resources Defense Council and Sea Change Foundation, on the allegations of Russian financial support for environmentalists’ anti-fracking and anti-pipeline campaigns.
The Marcellus Shale is a geological formation of sedimentary rock with large deposits of natural gas that cuts across southwestern New York, northern and western Pennsylvania, western Ohio, most of West Virginia, and small portions of Kentucky and Tennessee.
The U.S. Geological Survey determined that the Marcellus Shale contains “about 84 trillion cubic feet of undiscovered, technically recoverable natural gas and 3.4 billion barrels of undiscovered, technically recoverable natural gas liquids.”
Since the U.S. is now the top producer of natural gas in the world, and well positioned to export liquefied natural gas across the globe, Russia recognizes it gradually could lose influence in parts of the world where Moscow has been the dominant supplier of oil and gas, Stiles said in a phone interview.
“America’s natural gas revolution has huge geopolitical ramifications, so Russia’s motivation to try to block our natural gas development is easy to understand,” the CIA veteran said. “If you are worried about the Russian bear rearing its ugly head in the next several years, the way to stop that and put it back into its cage is to cut it off at the knees financially.”
“That’s what natural gas pipelines are all about and that’s what fracking is all about. We are providing affordable energy to average Americans at home and our allies overseas.”
The Sierra Club Foundation’s logo
US Gains in Market
In the fracking technique applied to shale formations, engineers inject water mixed with sand and chemicals into a well at high pressure, producing a fluid that fractures the rock and releases trapped oil or natural gas.
Environmentalists continue to challenge fracking, arguing among other things that it contaminates well water.
The natural gas import-export equation has changed radically in the past few years, with trends pointing to the U.S. becoming a net exporter.
Richard Westerdale, the senior adviser with the State Department, made this point in November during the Heartland Institute’s America First Energy Conference in Houston, Texas.
“By 2020, the U.S. will be approaching nearly 100 billion cubic meters in [liquefied natural gas] exports,” Westerdale said in a presentation. “It’s simply amazing to me to think that back in 2010, we were building [liquefied natural gas] import terminals.”
As natural gas markets become increasingly competitive, the “world wins,” he added, since “well-functioning markets reinforce global energy security, foster economic growth and commercial interests abroad, and, depending upon how host countries choose to use [natural gas resources], it can in fact enhance environmental stewardship.”
In three of the first five months of 2017, U.S. natural gas exports were greater than imports, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The most recent available data shows that U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas increased for the duration of 2017 as new facilities went operational.

What Consumers Know
Stiles, who teaches espionage and national security issues in Virginia Tech’s geography department, defines espionage, or spying, as “an operation that is planned and executed as to conceal the identity of, or permit plausible denial by, the sponsor.”
One way for Moscow to conceal its sponsorship of anti-fracking campaigns in New York or elsewhere in the U.S. is to move its funding indirectly and anonymously through various entities, the former CIA analyst told The Daily Signal.
“I think the groups and individuals on both sides of the debate over fracking and pipelines have a tendency to just look in their own back yards, without looking at the larger geopolitical picture,” Stiles said. “If it was more widely known that anti-fracking, anti-pipeline operations may be benefitting from a foreign source of funding, this would certainly impact the debate.”

The agents of influence described by Stiles range from “controlled agents” and “trusted contacts” who know they’re working for a foreign government to “manipulated sources” who have no idea that they’re doing the bidding of a foreign power.
The former CIA analyst said he is inclined to characterize environmental activists who received Russian funding through indirect channels, such as Sea Change or the Energy Foundation, as manipulated sources.
Stiles calls on the leadership of environmental groups such as the Sierra Club and Natural Resources Defense Council, which accepted large amounts through such channels, to start asking hard questions.
“It’s either a lack of due diligence or incompetence, or they may actually know something about a particular donor, but they don’t want to ask that question,” Stiles said. “I tend to think the issue is more that they are just not looking the gift horse in the mouth, and they are just taking the money.”

Paperless Money Trail
Sea Change Foundation, a family charity, is identified in congressional reports and correspondence as a major incubator of funding from foreign sources, including Russia. That money ends up in the coffers of U.S. environmental groups opposed to natural gas development and drilling techniques such as fracking that make that development possible.
Nathaniel Simons and his wife, Laura Baxter-Simons, established Sea Change Foundation in 2006. Simons is the son of James Simons, founder of the New York-based Renaissance Technologies hedge fund firm.
Sea Change, according to its website, works to “address the serious threats posed by global climate change,” focusing on “climate change mitigation and clean energy policy in the United States and internationally.”
In July 2014, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee released a report describing how a Bermuda-based company, Klein Ltd., “was set up for the sole purpose of funneling anonymous donations to Sea Change.”
Bermuda law permits Klein Ltd. to conceal foreign sources of funding, the report explains.
“It appears that Klein exists on paper only, as it does not have an internet presence, and was set up for the sole purpose of funneling anonymous donations to Sea Change,” the report says.
Subsequent investigations building on the findings of the Senate committee—including that of the Washington-based Environmental Policy Alliance—established a connection between Wakefield Quin, the law firm that set up Klein, and top Kremlin officials, including Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Lawyers and others at Wakefield Quin have been associated with Russian energy companies and worked with Leonid Reiman, a former Russian minister of telecommunications and longtime Putin ally, these investigations found.
Environmental Policy Alliance, which opposes the agenda of liberal green groups, is affiliated with Washington lobbyist Rick Berman and his Berman & Co. public affairs firm.
Sea Change has not responded directly to The Daily Signal in the past, and did not respond for this report.
In an email to Salon, however, the foundation in July 2017 acknowledged receiving financial support from Klein, saying it accepted the company’s grant money as “general support” with no proviso that it be used for specific programs.
Response From Klein Ltd.
In an email to The Daily Signal, Roderick M. Forrest, a Wakefield Quin lawyer representing Klein Ltd., described allegations against his Bermuda-based client as “completely false and irresponsible.” Klein, he said, “has no Russian connection whatsoever.”
Forrest made similar assertions in an email to The Washington Times in July 2017.
The Daily Signal had sought the law firm’s comment on allegations of Russian funding of U.S. environmental groups and Klein’s alleged role in easing movement of Russian funds to the Sea Change Foundation.
“Our firm has represented Klein since its inception,” Forrest said in the email, “and we can state categorically that at no point did this philanthropic organization receive or expend funds from Russian sources or Russian-connected sources and Klein has no Russian connection whatsoever.”
The lawyer for Klein added:
Attorneys, law firms, financial institutions and all other companies based in Bermuda operate under a regulatory and anti-money laundering regime which applies standards which are amongst the highest in the world. Illicit movement of funds falls well below such standards and any informed party would understand that, not only is there no substance or truth to such allegations in this case, the allegations appear to be intended to damage the reputation of the Bermuda-based individuals and businesses named.
Bermuda and the U.S. have in place an information exchange framework under which the U.S. government, its regulators and law enforcement agencies have access to all information concerning financial transactions in Bermuda and by Bermuda entities. Through this framework, information is available to such proper authorities, enabling them to be satisfied as to the probity of any alleged payments.
Julie Hill, a professor at University of Alabama School of Law with expertise in regulation of financial institutions, told The Daily Signal that it is not “as easy as it was at one time to engage in money laundering” in places such as Bermuda and the Cayman Islands.
That’s because monetary authorities now collect more information from companies than they did previously, Hill said.
“This information is not made public, but it can be given to foreign governments,” Hill said in an interview, adding:
The advantage in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands now would be more in terms of tax neutrality rather than anonymity. But it’s certainly true that various entities have in the past engaged in money laundering schemes in these locations, and the Russians would be part of this history. Today there are more barriers than in the past. That doesn’t mean it can’t be done, it just means it’s harder.
‘Ripe for Investigation’
Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, sent a letter in June to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin saying allegations of Russian financial support for U.S. environmental groups “are ripe for an investigation” by the Treasury Department.
In the letter, previously reported by The Daily Signal, Smith noted that Klein Ltd. and Wakefield Quin share the same Bermuda address “with more than 20 other companies” apparently run through the law firm.
A review of IRS 990 Forms shows that Klein contributed $23 million to Sea Change in 2010 and 2011, almost half of what the California foundation received in that time. The 990 forms indicate Sea Change then made grants concentrated on environmental advocacy groups.
From 2010  through 2015, the Sierra Club Foundation received more than $18 million from Sea Change and Natural Resources Defense Council received more than $15 million.
Both groups are on record opposing natural gas development in New York, and both are among the top 10 recipients of Sea Change grants, according to an analysis of foundation records.
The Energy Foundation, at $64 million, was the top recipient of Sea Change grants from 2010 through 2015, the most recent year for which 990s are available.
The 2014 Senate report describes the Energy Foundation as a “pass through” public charity that donates to environmental activist groups such as the Sierra Club Foundation and Natural Resources Defense Council.
The idea behind a “pass through” organization, according to the Senate report, is “to create the appearance of a more diversified base of support” and to “shield” donors from accountability.
Between 1998 and 2015, the Energy Foundation paid 30,178 grants to 12,058 recipients totaling more than $1.2 billion, records show. Grantees included environmental groups active in opposing natural gas development of the Marcellus Shale.
The top recipient was Natural Resources Defense Council, with more than $35 million. The Sierra Club Foundation received more than $16 million. (The council has $236.5 million in net assets, while the foundation has $113.2 million in net assets.)
Recalling Cold War History

Paul Kengor, a Grove City College political science professor who has researched the history of Moscow’s manipulation of U.S. political figures, told The Daily Signal that he sees an “old Cold War powder keg that went dry suddenly being reignited.”
“What makes the current situation more nefarious today is the possibility—if this is indeed accurate—of Russian manipulation of domestic groups inside the United States and the willful cooperation of those domestic environmentalists,” Kengor, a biographer of Ronald Reagan, said in an email, adding:
In the 1980s, Ronald Reagan had one heck of a time trying to enlist the support of our Western allies in blocking the Siberian gas pipeline in Russia. Even [British Prime Minister] Margaret Thatcher balked; in fact, that’s an understatement: Thatcher was vehemently opposed because she wanted Britain to have the cheap Russian gas and wanted some British firms to have some of the construction contracts. The same was true for the West Germans and the French.
Ronald Reagan boldly proceeded almost alone in this effort in the 1980s. But here today … we have the extremely troubling possibility of our own U.S. citizens being targeted by the Russians for manipulation in undercutting our own domestic energy industry, our workers, and our citizens.
What stands out in terms of Cold War history and its relevance to contemporary questions of espionage is the role of Putin, warns Bonner Cohen, a senior fellow with the National Center for Public Policy Research, a Washington-based think tank that supports free market solutions to policy challenges.
“Putin, let’s not forget, is an old hand at using Western pressure groups to serve the Kremlin’s purposes,” Cohen said in an email.
“When, in the 1980s, the old Soviet Union was manipulating self-styled ‘peace groups’ in Western Europe and the U.S. in an effort to divide NATO and isolate the U.S., Putin was a mid-level KGB agent in East Germany.”
Cohen added:
Though that effort ultimately failed, Putin learned his lesson well. Then it was U.S. missiles to defend Western Europe that had to be demonized; today, it is U.S. oil and natural gas that are portrayed as a threat. In both cases, money changed hands, and scare tactics were the order of the day.
New Yorkers and High Energy Costs
New York residents continue to pay the price for Cuomo’s ban on drilling techniques that make it possible to access natural gas from the Marcellus Shale, laments Moreau, executive director of the American Petroleum Institute’s New York office.
“People who could have had inexpensive natural gas instead have had to pay very high electricity prices due to the cold snap this winter,” Moreau told The Daily Signal, “and many power generators were actually forced to burn oil instead of natural gas due to the constraints on natural gas.”
The 625 members of API, a national trade association, include major energy companies in the oil and gas industry.
Although New York is the fourth-largest consumer of natural gas in the nation, that natural gas primarily is imported from other states, Moreau said.
“If not for the pro-energy development policies of other states, New Yorkers would be bitterly freezing this winter,” she said.
The Daily Signal sought comment from Cuomo’s office to ask if the New York governor had concerns about allegations of Russian support for environmental groups active in his state. His office has not responded.
Cohen, of the National Center for Public Policy Research, said he sees a connection between Putin’s government in Moscow and influential U.S. environmental groups that is difficult to deny.
“The Sierra Club, Natural Resources Defense Council, and other advocacy groups may have their own ‘green’ reasons for opposing America’s realizing the energy potential of its abundant fossil fuels,” Cohen said in an email to The Daily Signal.  “At the same time, these groups know full well that they receive funding from the Sea Change Foundation and the Energy Foundation, both of which, according to a congressional report, are funded by Russian interests via a Bermuda-based shell company.”
Some green groups and Russia under Putin “have a common interest in demonizing fracking and related technologies that have tilted global energy markets in America’s favor,” Cohen said.
“Just as the shale revolution has been an economic godsend to millions of Americans, providing them with affordable electricity and transportation fuel, it has been a nightmare for Russia and environmental activists.”

"One of the dramatic signs opposing the proposed PennEast Pipeline that dot a road in Hopewell Township, New Jersey. The natural gas pipeline awaits federal approval. (Photo: Kevin Mooney/The Daily Signal)
Anyone traveling along the roadways that run parallel to that part of the Delaware River where George Washington staged his famous Christmas night crossing in 1776 is sure to encounter signs that take aim at an energy project known as the PennEast Pipeline.
Some of those signs invoke revolutionary language with statements that claim “We the People Say No to PennEast.” 
Other signs say: “Don’t Let them Poison Our Water! Stop PennEast,” “Pipeline Blast Zone, Stop PennEast,” “Just Say No! Stop PennEast,” and “Stop the Fracking Pipelines.” 
The messages opposing the natural gas pipeline can be spotted along roadways on both the Pennsylvania and New Jersey sides of the river.
Any day now, the six energy companies that are part of the PennEast Pipeline project expect to get a green light to proceed from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates the interstate transmission of natural gas, oil, and electricity. That approval would come in the form of a certificate allowing construction and operation of the pipeline.
The anti-pipeline signs and mailings mention ReThink Energy NJ, a coalition of environmentalists who have received substantial funding from the Philadelphia-based William Penn Foundation.
Under current plans, the proposed 120-mile-long, 36-inch-diameter, underground pipeline would originate just north of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, in an area that interconnects with other major interstate pipelines that serve markets on the East Coast, including New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. 
Wilkes-Barre, the county seat of Luzerne County, sits on the outskirts of the Pocono Mountains in the northeastern part of Pennsylvania.
If the federal commission OKs it, a year from now a new pipeline will be poised to transport natural gas across Eastern Pennsylvania and the Delaware River into Mercer County, New Jersey, where it will interconnect with the Transco Pipeline in the borough of Pennington.
The PennEast Pipeline would draw from natural gas produced in the Marcellus shale formation that cuts across Pennsylvania, New York, and parts of Ohio and West Virginia.

‘The Least Cost Available’
Tony Cox, project manager for PennEast, told The Daily Signal in an interview that he expects energy consumers in Pennsylvania and New Jersey to begin to see the benefits of the pipeline beginning in the winter of 2018-2019. 
With approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission expected this fall, the seven-month construction phase would begin next spring, and the pipeline would become operational in the second half of next year, according to PennEast’s projected timeline.
“September is what we call a ‘shoulder month’ in the gas industry, because you are past the summer months, but you are not yet in the winter. This means you are in a period of low energy consumption,” Cox said, adding:
But we still see a vast disparity between the price of gas in the Marcellus region and in New Jersey. These price differences around the country are one of the drivers for natural gas infrastructure, and one of the obligations that gas utilities have is to procure the least cost of gas available. 
Right now, as it relates to New Jersey, that gas is located 100 miles away in Pennsylvania. But as we can see from the price difference, there is not ample infrastructure to get the gas to where it needs to go.
As of late September, Cox noted, the price for natural gas delivery in the Marcellus Shale region was $1.79 per dekatherm (a unit of energy measurement), compared with $3.16 per dekatherm in New Jersey, according to Gas Daily, a publication that provides the oil and gas industry with analytical reports on prices in the energy markets. That’s a difference of $1.37, or 76.5 percent higher, in New Jersey.
“Right now, there’s not enough capacity to meet the energy demands of New Jersey residents during peak periods, as evidenced by the large price differentials between these two areas,” Cox said. “With PennEast, we will have the ability to dampen the impact of high-demand periods and provide cost savings.”
When the $1.37 price difference for natural gas between the Marcellus area of Pennsylvania and New Jersey is “amplified by the capacity PennEast will have to transport natural gas,” Cox said, he anticipates “more than a half of a billion dollars in savings” to New Jersey consumers.
Sierra Club Disputes Figures
The PennEast project manager is not alone in projecting substantial savings.
 PennEast proponents point to a study from Concentric Energy Advisors—which describes itself as an independent management consulting and financial advisory firm focused on the North American energy industry—that found PennEast would provide  savings of more than $500 million for electricity and natural gas consumers in Pennsylvania and savings of more than $400 million for consumers in New Jersey.
Despite the intense opposition of environmental activists, who view the pipeline as a danger to the region, PennEast appears set to secure the necessary regulatory approval to move forward.
In April, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued a favorable final environmental impact statement for PennEast that said any potential impact would be “adequately minimized” through mitigation efforts. 
In August, the U.S. Senate confirmed the Trump administration’s nominees to the commission, providing the agency with the quorum needed to approve projects such as PennEast.
But Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey Sierra Club, disputes the figures PennEast has circulated that show energy consumers stand to benefit financially from the new infrastructure. Instead, he anticipates the pipeline actually would raise costs.
“Individually, these companies [that are part of PennEast] have been seeking rate hikes to pay for the pipelines, because they cost money,” Tittel said. “They have to pay back investors. How does this save people money?”
Tittel also cited a report from Stephanie Brand, director of the New Jersey Division of Rate Counsel, who has expressed reservations about the pipeline’s cost and utility. The division’s mission is to advocate for energy consumers.
“PennEast is dangerous and unnecessary, and the PennEast companies are just trying to make money for themselves. This has nothing to do with consumers and their energy needs,” the Sierra Club leader said. “Natural gas is a commodity, and the price is set by commodity markets, and it’s just not true to say that the pipeline will lower prices.”
“The other problem is that the pipeline will pass through environmentally sensitive and scenic areas, and pass through quaint, bucolic little towns that depend on ecotourism. This is also a historic area, where [George] Washington crossed the Delaware. 
“Now you’re going to have this big, ugly pipeline cutting through, and it’s going to hurt the economy,” Tittel said.

‘Alternatives Are More Expensive’
In the “Frequently Asked Questions” section of its website, PennEast provides readers with detailed answers to questions about the project’s size and scope, potential economic benefits to consumers, environmental safeguards, and restoration efforts that will take place once the pipeline is completed. A separate report from PennEast describes how natural gas development will bring both economic and environmental benefits.
Pat Kornick, a spokeswoman for PennEast, said “well-funded” anti-pipeline activists who have maintained a constant presence in the public eye and in the media are not looking out for the best interests of the people they claim to represent.
“When people question the need for a new pipeline, they are not seeing the big price discrepancies that exist between the New Jersey marketplace and the Pennsylvania portions of the Marcellus, where natural gas is produced,” she said. “Pipelines are the cheapest, most effective way to bring natural gas to market. The alternatives to pipelines, which involve the trucking and transportation of liquefied natural gas, are much more expensive.”
The funding that stands behind the environmental activism directed against natural gas development is evident from the signs littering the roadways in New Jersey, and from mailings delivered to area residents. 
Every member of the coalition called ReThink Energy, cited on the opposition materials, has received substantial funding from the William Penn Foundation, a private, nonprofit charity.
Grants the foundation distributed to ReThink Energy members in recent years include $395,000 in 2017 and $582,000 in 2015 to the New Jersey Conservation Foundation, $82,500 in 2016 to the Stony Brook-Millstone Watershed Association, and $227,400 in 2016 to the Pinelands Preservation Alliance.
Tom Shepstone, who operates the Natural Gas Now blog, a product of his research firm based in Honesdale, Pennsylvania, told The Daily Signal that the William Penn Foundation is not permitted to do any lobbying as a private charity. But, he argued,  the organization is making an end run around the prohibition by distributing grants to environmental activists and compliant media outlets that do its bidding. 
“As a private foundation, they shouldn’t be doing any lobbying, but when you think about it that’s all they do at the foundation,” Shepstone said. “When they pass out money year after year to certain groups, they are doing this to influence public policy.”
Foundation-Funded News Outlets Defend Coverage 
Shepstone said he also sees a connection between the William Penn Foundation and negative press coverage of PennEast. 
Philadelphia-based WHYY Inc., which has TV, radio, and digital news operations, has received $660,000 from William Penn for its StateImpact Pennsylvania news service. Community Foundation of New Jersey, which supports the NJ Spotlight news service, has received $350,200 from William Penn.
“So much of the narrative against PennEast is written by the people who are on the same side as the people spinning the narrative,” Shepstone said. “The groups opposed to the pipeline have a shared funding source in the form of the William Penn Foundation, and you also have StateImpact Pennsylvania and NJ Spotlight, which are funded by the William Penn Foundation. 
“So, when an environmental group has something negative to say about PennEast, that’s immediately picked up by these two news services to echo it and repeat it. It is so sad to see newspaper reporters not pick up on these blatant conflicts of interest,” he said.
Lee Keough, editor-in-chief of NJ Spotlight, defended his organization’s coverage in an email Wednesday to The Daily Signal.
“We receive financial support from all sides of this issue—utilities, environmental groups, the William Penn Foundation, as well as PennEast itself,” Keough wrote, adding:
Take a look at our site today … You may have to reload a few times to see all the ads. Nor do I think we have necessarily taken a critical view of the issue, although we have given it a lot of coverage. That reflects the passion that pipelines engender locally.
WHYY, the media company behind the StateImpact Pennsylvania news service, also responded to The Daily Signal’s request for comment.
“We strive to present balanced and factual information that takes into account all sides of the pipeline issue,” Sandra Clark, WHYY vice president for news and civic dialogue, said in an email.
“As with all of our reporting, no funder dictates our editorial coverage in any way and, as always, we’re sensitive to potential or perceived conflicts of interest. The issues raised about our coverage of the PennEast Pipeline have no basis in fact.”
Foundation Mum on Funding 
The Daily Signal repeatedly invited the William Penn Foundation to comment for this article on its funding of environmental groups and media organizations, and asked what its position is on PennEast. The foundation did not respond.
The Sierra Club Foundation received $300,000 from the William Penn Foundation in 2017 and $250,000 in 2016. But Tittel said his New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club and the Sierra Club Foundation are two separate organizations, and his New Jersey group has not received funding from the foundation. 
Tom Gilbert, campaign director for energy, climate, and natural resources at the New Jersey Conservation Foundation, declined to address his organization’s relationship with the William Penn Foundation, but explained why his group is opposed to the pipeline.
“We oppose PennEast because it would have significant impacts on thousands of acres of taxpayer preserved open space and farmland, some of the cleanest streams in the state, and habitat for threatened and endangered species,” Gilbert said in an email to The Daily Signal, adding:
Furthermore, energy experts and the N.J. Division of Rate Counsel have concluded that there is no evidence of need for the project, and it would be ‘unfair to ratepayers.’
PennEast faces tremendous opposition in New Jersey. Approximately two-thirds of the affected homeowners have refused to grant them survey access or easements.  Every town in the path of the pipeline opposes it. Thousands of citizens spoke out against it during the FERC [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] process.

Real or Illusory Opposition?
The idea that there is a groundswell of opposition to the pipeline on the part of the public is highly suspect, Shepstone of the Natural Gas Now blog told The Daily Signal.
“When you see all these signs out there, you have to remember that the funding behind them comes from narrow special interests that do not speak for average citizens and from one rich family at the William Penn Foundation opposed to development,” he said. 
“The public stands to benefit from the pipeline and from clean, affordable natural gas. These environmental groups are just shills for the William Penn Foundation, and with their echo chamber in the media, it makes the opposition seem bigger than it really is.”
Another key player is the Delaware Riverkeeper Network, a nonprofit based in Bristol, Pennsylvania, which has been a persistent opponent of PennEast since the project was first announced. 
The Riverkeeper Network has been sharply critical of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the agency’s positive environmental assessment of PennEast.
“There are very serious ramifications from PennEast for people’s health and safety,” Riverkeeper Network President Maya K. van Rossum said. “We are talking about devastation to very important habitats, wetlands, and forests, and increased pollution running off into our waterways, and this runoff contributing to erosion and the loss of habitat.”
The group released its own report on what it calls the economic costs of PennEast.
“The damage done by PennEast will far outpace any benefits,” van Rossum said. “The tradeoff is not worth it in terms of lives and livelihoods.”
The William Penn Foundation donated about $1.4 million to the Delaware Riverkeeper Network in 2017 and $914,000 in 2015. But van Rossum dismissed the idea that her organization takes direction from the foundation. 
“That’s a false argument, a misrepresentation, and a red herring,” she said, adding:
We have multiple funding streams, and foundation funding is but one of them. When you apply for a foundation grant, you propose the work that you are going to do in the public interest, and the funder chooses whether or not to support that work. The funder does not give you money and then dictate what you are to do with it.
‘Held Hostage’
Jordan McGillis is a policy analyst with the Washington-based Institute for Energy Research, a nonprofit that  supports a free-market approach to energy policy. McGillis is highly critical of the role the Delaware Riverkeeper Network has played through the PennEast approval process.
“Despite their proximity to the Marcellus Shale, New Jersey and the rest of the northeastern states pay some of the highest electricity rates in the country,” McGillis said. “The reason is that they’re being held hostage by the ‘keep-it-in-the-ground’ movement. In the case of New Jersey, one of the main culprits is the Delaware Riverkeeper Network and its frivolous lawsuits.”
The energy policy analyst added:
The pernicious effect groups like this have isn’t trivial. Each pipeline delay results in New Jersey residents paying millions of dollars more than is necessary for energy. A study by Concentric Energy Advisors estimated that people in New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania could have saved $900 million in the winter of 2013-2014 had something like the Penneast pipeline been operable.
When you look at the 990s [IRS tax forms], and you see that groups like the Delaware Riverkeeper aren’t the local, grass-roots movements they purport to be, but rather are funded by megadonors like the William Penn Foundation, it adds to the frustration you feel for the people who bear the costs of the seemingly endless legal delays.
Shepstone, the Natural Gas Now blogger, told The Daily Signal that the Delaware River Basin Commission’s authority over pipelines “is highly questionable,” and he expects PennEast to go forward.
PennEast is working to obtain approval from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and the Delaware River Basin Commission, a federal interstate agency. 
But the ultimate authority rests with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Earlier this year, the New Jersey environmental agency returned PennEast’s application, saying it wanted more information. 
“We are still working with all of these local agencies to obtain their approval,” Kornick, the PennEast spokeswoman, said. “With the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, they didn’t reject our application. They said it was incomplete and asked for more information, which we are providing.”

"""It’s a wrong that needs to be righted,"" veteran teacher Jane Ladley says of a teachers union veto of her choice of a charity as an alternative to paying the union. (Photo courtesy of The Fairness Center)
Teachers who object to paying union fees on religious grounds are too political, some union leaders in Pennsylvania argue in a new twist on long-standing complaints about organized labor’s involvement in elective politics.  
But at least two of those teachers, who just had their day in court to put state labor laws under scrutiny, see more than a little irony at work in the union complaints. 
Lawyers for Jane Ladley, who taught in public schools for 25 years before retiring in 2014 from Avon Grove School District in Chester County, argued her case Dec. 11 before the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania in Harrisburg.
Joining Ladley in suing the Pennsylvania State Education Association, a teachers union, was Chris Meier, a history and economics teacher at Penn Manor High School in Lancaster County for the past 10 years. 
Neither teacher is a member of PSEA, but the union secured contractual agreements with their respective school districts that require nonmembers such as Ladley and Meier to pay what the union calls “fair share fees.” 
This is one of about 80 lawsuits filed across the nation by public employees against labor unions to recover union fees, terminate union membership, halt dues deduction, or challenge exclusive representation, according to the Pennsylvania-based Commonwealth Foundation.  
Pennsylvania law permits teachers such as Ladley and Meier, who object on religious grounds to paying the mandatory union fees and what they fund, to steer money from their paychecks to the charity of their choice rather than the teachers union. 
But there’s a catch, as David Osborne, an attorney with the Fairness Center, a nonprofit law firm based in Harrisburg, explained in an interview.
“For some time, the law has allowed religious objectors to send money to a charity of their choice that’s equal to the amount that would otherwise be sent to the union,” Osborne told The Daily Signal. “But, at the same time, the charity has to be agreed upon between the nonmember and the union.”
What State Law Does
The way the law works, money is withheld from a public employee’s check and deposited into a separate account while the PSEA, or other union, processes the employee’s selection of a charity. In the case of Ladley and Meier, the PSEA objected to their choices. 
Ladley had settled on a scholarship fund for high school seniors who want to study the U.S. Constitution, but the union objected. She then selected the Constitutional Organization of Liberty, which supplies educational information highlighting American history and the ideals of the Constitution.
The teachers union didn’t respond to Ladley’s proposed alternative, according to a press release from the Fairness Center.
“They are telling me which groups I have to choose,” Ladley is quoted as saying. “It’s a wrong that needs to be righted. I’m doing this on principle and for the other teachers coming up through the ranks, so that they can have these options available to them.”
As his charity, Meier selected the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, a nonprofit based in Virginia that provides legal assistance to public employees who seek to free themselves from union membership.
“I want freedom of choice—to be able to donate to the charity I choose,” Meier said in a statement released by the Fairness Center.
So far, that choice has not materialized. 
“The PSEA refused Chris’s selection on the basis that the [National Right to Work Legal Defense] Foundation provided legal representation to teachers who sued the PSEA,” the Fairness Center said of Meier’s case.
According to the teachers union, it said, allowing Meier to help fund the foundation “would be a ‘conflict of interest’” for the union.
Union’s Giving to Politicians
Osborne, the Fairness Center attorney, also said he was unimpressed with the union’s objections to the selected charity of the other teacher, Ladley.
“The PSEA said it would not agree to the selected charities because the union thought they were too political,” Osborne said. “Ms. Ladley thought that was laughable because the PSEA is one of the most political organizations in the whole state.”
The  Pennsylvania State Education Association has more than 181,000 members, including teachers and other education professionals, making it the largest public employee union in the state. 
In 2018, the union contributed more than $1.5 million to Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, during his successful reelection race. Campaign records also show Wolf was the top recipient of the union’s contributions from 2010 to 2016, receiving $865,000. 
In the past quarter-century, the union has contributed more than $14 million to Pennsylvania Democrats and a little more than $3 million to Republicans, campaign records show.  
The Fairness Center represents the plaintiffs in the Ladley case and in a related case, Hartnett v. PSEA.
In the second case, teachers who have chosen not to become union members object to the collection of “fair share fees” as a violation of their First Amendment freedoms. Greg Hartnett, a teacher in the Homer Center School District, is the lead plaintiff.
Related: 1 Year after Union Ruling, Pennsylvania Law Still Allows for Unconstitutional Fees
The Daily Signal asked media relations officials of the Pennsylvania State Education Association for comment on the arguments made by the plaintiffs in the Ladley and Hartnett cases. 
The Daily Signal also asked the teachers union whether it had concerns that that “fair share fee” requirements included in its contracts are illegal in light of the Supreme Court ruling. 
The union had not responded at publication time. 
Role of the Supreme Court 
The Fairness Center has partnered with the National Right to Work Foundation to represent Hartnett and the other schoolteachers in the second case.
“The Hartnett and Ladley cases have become very similar, even though they held different facts at the outset,” Osborne said.
That’s because the Supreme Court struck down mandatory union dues and fees for public sector workers in deciding  the case of  Janus v. AFSCME in June 2018.
“What unified the two cases was the Janus decision,” Osborne said. “Janus could change everything. If the court applies Janus and rules to invalidate that part of Pennsylvania labor law that makes fair share fees possible, then that settles both cases.”
Osborne also said he sees potential for the Ladley and Hartnett cases to reverberate across state lines. 
“These cases could have an impact in other states, many of which still have agency fee statues on the books,” the teachers’ lawyer said. 
The funds for the teachers in the Ladley case were initially held in an escrow account while the Janus case was pending before the Supreme Court. But the union refunded the money after the high court decided Janus.
“The union tried to moot this case to avoid a ruling on the merits,” Osborne said, adding:
Fortunately, the court understood the argument we were making and that Pennsylvania law has not been addressed on this point. The PSEA is arguing that the court doesn’t need to rule because the union claims it has already done everything that is required. But the problem is that PSEA’s promises are self-serving and they could change their mind anytime. There’s still a collective bargaining agreement with fair share fees, and the PSEA has done nothing to change this.
Pushing Back
Charles Mitchell, president and CEO of the Commonwealth Foundation, a free-market think tank based in Harrisburg, has followed both cases. In a  press release, Mitchell said the Supreme Court’s Janus ruling is beginning to arouse government workers who have been denied their free speech rights.
“More workers are realizing that their union’s leadership is acting for themselves rather than for workers,” Mitchell said. “Our friends and neighbors in public service shouldn’t have to sue to have the same rights as you and I.”
The Fairness Center’s lawsuits against the teachers union in Pennsylvania figure into a larger national picture, according to a new report from the Commonwealth Foundation detailing the legislative and legal response to Janus across the country. 
In 2019, lawmakers introduced more than 100 Janus-related bills at the state level, the report says. 
“In many states, union leaders are using their considerable lobbying resources to slow legislation that would enforce Janus and to pass union-friendly bills,” Mitchell says in the report. 
But Pennsylvania is among the states pushing back from the other direction with legislation that would bring state labor laws into compliance with the Supreme Court ruling, the report notes. 
The report says Pennsylvania and California account for nearly half of the roughly 80 lawsuits filed by public employees against labor unions to recover union fees, terminate union membership, halt dues deduction, or challenge exclusive representation.

"Parents' efforts to reverse ""LGBT education"" measures or prevent their implementation will be an uphill battle. (Photo: Stock/Getty Images)
TRENTON, N.J.—Parents are plenty angry about a New Jersey law that requires LGBT material to be incorporated into public school classroom instruction.
The parents say they are concerned the new law will “teach
lifestyles and life choices that stand 100% against our family values.” They
object to their tax dollars being used for what they call an “assault on
religious liberty.” 
And they say a special interest group helping develop curriculum for the new requirements has a “radical agenda” that could jeopardize the health and safety of children.
One parent warned about how the “gender ideology” already prevalent
in public schools can “brainwash” a child into believing he is a girl rather
than a boy and vice-versa.
As parents found out Jan. 4  at a “parental rights” conference in Flemington, New Jersey, elected officials and religious leaders share their concerns. But the effort to reverse these laws or prevent their implementation will be an uphill battle.  
At the meeting, Victoria Jakelsky, state director of a grassroots
group called Protect Your Children, or Team PYC, estimated that about 60
parental rights activists from Team PYC would be in Trenton Wednesday to
testify against the new law.
But Kathy Goldenberg, president of the New Jersey State
Board of Education, told parents Wednesday that the board was not empowered to make
any policy changes with regard to the curriculum focused on lesbian, gay,
bisexual, and transgender issues.
“The law was enacted by the state Legislature, and it did not
grant the board a policymaking role with this law,” Goldenberg said. “But we
are glad to listen to your comments.”
At issue is LGBT education legislation that New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, signed into law Jan. 31, 2019.
New Jersey became the second state in the nation, following California, to pass a law requiring public schools to teach about LGBT history.   
The New Jersey measure says the state board of education “shall include instruction on the political, economic and social contribution of persons with disabilities and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people in an appropriate place in the curriculum of middle school and high school students as part of the district’s implementation of the New Jersey Student Learning Standards.”
A pilot program designed to accommodate the new curriculum began in 12 public schools as of Jan. 7. 
All New Jersey middle and high schools are supposed to be equipped
to begin meeting the new requirements this coming fall. 
The immediate aim in speaking at the school board hearing Wednesday
and in meeting with public officials is to find a way to postpone full
implementation of the program, Jakelsky said.
“We want to be clear. We care about each and every child, and we
support and defend equality,” Jakelsky told The Daily Signal. “We are highly
concerned that the LGBT history will teach lifestyles and life choices that
stand 100% against our family values, our deeply held religious views, and the
way we practice our faith.”
Some parents said they could support an opt-out provision, but
Jakelsky said she does not think that would be sufficient. 
All the groups taking part in the Jan. 4 conference were united in
opposition to the new law. Those included “teachers, school board members,
Orthodox Jews, Muslims, and Coptic Christians,” said Jakelsky, who lives in Hunterdon
County.
Protect Your Children, she said, has grown to about 1,000 active
members since being formed at a rally last June. It is affiliated with ParentalRights.org, and includes
evangelical Protestants, Roman Catholics, Coptic Christians, and other
concerned citizens, she said. 
Jakelsky said Team PYC also is aligned with Muslim and Jewish
groups that share concerns about the potential dangers the LGBT curriculum
presents to students. Team PYC is on
Facebook. 
But some were there Jan. 4 to bring to light similar laws enacted
by Murphy and New Jersey’s Democrat-controlled Legislature.  
Crystal Lopez, who lives in Sussex County, attended on behalf of NewJerseyMama.net, which advocates repeal of a state law that she says prevents licensed therapists from providing individuals afflicted with gender dysphoria from obtaining a “fair and balanced medical assessment.”  
Lopez, who also is active with the Kelsey Coalition, a nationwide group that
works to “promote policies and laws to protect young people who identify as
transgender,” recounted a two-hour phone conversation she had with her son when
he “came out” and said he was transgender. She tells the full story on her website. 
Her son was 19 and attending Rutgers University at the time, and Lopez
asked counselors at Rutgers to help him identify his male biology. But a New
Jersey law against “conversion therapy” prevented counselors from giving her
son the help he needed, Lopez said during her presentation.
“Gender ideology has brainwashed my son and erased his childhood,”
Lopez said. “My son now thinks he is really a girl. The curriculum that is
being implemented is really harmful and is meant to confuse our children.”
Others focused on Garden State Equality, a group headquartered in Asbury Park that describes itself as a “statewide advocacy and education organization for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community,” and helped establish the curriculum and initiate the pilot program.  
Garden State Equality, which claims 150,000 members and presents details of the LGBT curriculum on its website, is working to advance a “radical agenda” that “undermines the constitutional rights of parents,” Jakelsky said. 
 >>> Related: This School District Partners with LGBT Advocacy Group to Impose Transgender Policy
The Daily Signal sought comment from Garden State Equality for
this report, but the group did not respond before publication. 
Thomas Sobol, of Flemington, took issue with what he called an
assault on personal freedom. 
The LGBT agenda is “wrong, wrong, wrong for public schools,” Sobol told The Daily Signal. “This agenda should not be forced on people and I don’t think that it’s age appropriate to have this in public schools. Public education should be neutral, and it’s unfair to exclude people with religious values. This agenda did not come out of nowhere.”
Mayor Ed McKelvey, a Republican from Alloway Township in Salem
County and an ordained pastor who has attracted media attention for
speaking out against the LGBT curriculum, said it is a matter of right and
wrong.
“God never calls you to do something that does not line up with
his word, even if what he calls you to do doesn’t always make natural sense,”
McKelvey told audience members.
Pat Stanley, a member of the Franklin Township School
Board in Somerset County, warned Team PYC members that too many
government officials “have a mindset that says your kids are theirs.”
She said the law firm Strauss Esmay Associates, based
in Toms River, “greases the skids” for the LGBT curriculum to be implemented in
the state. Stanley estimates that it costs schools about $13,000 a year to work
with Strauss Esmay and that the firm has about 500 clients.
“You are the teachers of your children, not the government,” Stanley
said. “This is an assault on the rights of parents. We should not have to
protect our children against this nonsense. We already have kids who can’t read
or do math, and now they are being burdened with this undue influence.”
The Daily Signal sought comment from Strauss Esmay, but the law firm
did not respond after acknowledging the inquiry. 
Mayor Alfonso Cirulli of Barnegat Township in Ocean County called on
Christians from across denominations to unite in an effort to reform New Jersey
laws that undermine biblical teachings. 
Cirulli, a Republican, has been widely quoted for saying
that the LGBT curriculum mandates could “indoctrinate” students.
 “This is a spiritual battle,” he said. “We have the Lord
behind us.”
Cirulli, a former assistant school principal, told the audience Jan.
4 that the letter “P” for pedophilia could be added to the LGBT acronym. 
Cirulli said he sees a “full-scale assault” against Christian values at work in television commercials, public libraries, the toy industry, and other venues. 
Pastor Steve Nash from LOFT Wesleyan Church in Hillsborough suggested
parents may need to start pulling children out of public schools. 
“There is a battle for the souls of our children and our nation,”
Nash said in his talk, adding:
They are trying to propagate their views onto innocent children. As Christians, we see homosexuality as a matter of rebellion against God because it undermines the creation of God. This is being done to undermine the institution of the family. As parents, we have an awesome responsibility to raise kids because they are a gift from God.
A dozen members of Team PYC are scheduled to meet Jan. 30 with Lamont Repollet, New Jersey’s commissioner of education.
Group members also plan to testify at school boards across the state in February and March, and to hold “prayer and policy meetings” in some counties.

"“I asked them if it was OK to take this piece of land and grow wheat and they all said it was OK,” Jack LaPant recalls of  government officials he consulted. (Photo: Pacific Legal Foundation)
No one told Jack LaPant that he could be in violation of the Clean Water Act for farming his own land.
That’s mostly because the federal law includes a clear exemption for “normal” farming activities. But it’s also because the government officials LaPant consulted didn’t view overturned dirt that has been tilled and plowed as pollution.
In 2016, the Army Corps of Engineers, which administers the Clean Water Act with the Environmental Protection Agency, began legal action against LaPant for plowing he did in 2011 to plant wheat on a ranch property he owned in Northern California. 
But in March 2012, LaPant had sold the property, located in Tehama County about 4 miles south of the city of Red Bluff.
Before plowing his field to plant wheat, LaPant conferred in person with the Farm Service Agency in California, which is part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
“All of these government officials I spoke with, and they have all been deposed, they never once suggested that I should go meet with the Army Corps of Engineers,” LaPant said in a phone interview with The Daily Signal. 
“I asked them if it was OK to take this piece of land and grow wheat and they all said it was OK,” he recalled. “Even today, you can go into these offices and they will not tell a farmer that he needs to go and see the Army Corps to farm on his own land. It makes no sense and the Department of Agriculture doesn’t understand any of it, and we are talking about the same federal government.”
LaPant recalls visiting “four different government folks” with expertise in soil conservation when he was researching the history of the farm.
“They all gave me the same answer,” LaPant said. “They told me, ‘Jack, if you’d like to go ahead and plant it the same way it’s been planted in the past, go ahead. But if you want to go in and plant a permanent crop, then maybe we’ll go back and study it.’ So, I went ahead and planted 900 acres of wheat.”
The legal complications for LaPant began after he sold the property to Duarte Nursery, a family-owned nursery operation based in Tehama County, California, which then encountered similar problems with the Army Corps of Engineers. 
Duarte Nursery entered into a settlement agreement with the federal government after suing the Army Corps of Engineers for denying due process. Pacific Legal Foundation, a nonprofit, public interest law firm based in Sacramento, California, and Washington, D.C., represented the nursery in the case and now represents LaPant.
Tony Francois, a lawyer with Pacific Legal Foundation who specializes in property rights, told The Daily Signal that the orchard-planting operations of another company, Goose Pond Ag, may be what led to the prosecution of LaPant. 
Goose Pond Ag, a Florida-based farmland management company, purchased a portion of the California property from Duarte Nursery in 2012. Six years later, in 2018, the company reached a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department in which it agreed to pay $5.3 million in civil penalties for Clean Water Act violations, according to media reports.
“It’s the orchard planting and the preparations for the orchard planting, which involves fairly substantial earthwork, that really got the Army’s attention and got this whole enforcement action going,” Francois said. “What’s odd about it is that they roped LaPant into it, and we think the Army may have initially thought LaPant was part of this plan to plant the orchard.”
This month, Pacific Legal Foundation plans to submit a motion for summary judgment to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California that could resolve some or all of LaPant’s case based on “application of the law to the undisputed facts in the case,” Francois said.
If the case is not resolved,  it could move to a jury trial sometime in 2020.
The Daily Signal sought comment from the Army Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency. Neither agency had responded by publication time. 
What’s particularly alarming to LaPant and other farmers familiar with his case is that in their view the Corps saw fit to modify the Clean Water Act without congressional approval, Francois said.
“There’s a pretty broad, clear statement in the Clean Water Act that you don’t need a permit for normal farming activities,” Francois said, adding:
This would include normal ranching, farming, forestry activities. But the Army has added multiple conditions that you have to meet for these protections [for such operations] to continue.
One of these conditions is that the property has to be tilled pretty regularly for this protection to continue. But there are many reasons why a farmer may suspend tilling. For example, cattle may have a higher price than wheat or corn, and so the land might be used for grazing for a period of time. 
The Army has definitely added hurdles and obstacles to a pretty clear and simple statement of the Clean Water Act that you don’t need a permit for normal farming activities. In our view, what they’ve done is to change the policy decision Congress made.

"Francisco Molina, a former shop steward, ran into a problem when he resigned from SEIU Local 668 and demanded that the union stop deducting dues from his paycheck as a social services aide. (Photo: The Fairness Center)
Francisco Molina got a refund check from his former union compensating him for dues collected after he resigned his membership.
This means that the money Molina earned on the job since that time can’t be used to finance union political activity he doesn’t support.
But what about the dues he paid as a social services aide for Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, prior to resigning from the union? This question remains unresolved.
That’s because a Pennsylvania law makes it possible for labor unions to collect dues from government workers who decide they no longer want to be union members. 
Molina, who was a shop steward for Service Employees International Union Local 668, ran into difficulty a little more than a year ago when he resigned from the union. 
He told SEIU officials to stop collecting dues from his paycheck. 
What happens next in his case, and others raising similar legal questions, could have ramifications across the country. Millions of dollars, perhaps tens of millions, in union dues and fees are at stake, according to legal filings. 
Related: He Tried to Quit His Union. The Law Didn’t Let Him, and He Lost His Government Job Instead.
Molina has said he resigned from SEIU membership because his “personal values never matched the union’s.” 
Going After Refunds 
Liberty Justice Center, a nonprofit, public interest law firm based in Chicago, has joined with National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, a nonprofit legal advocacy group in Springfield, Virginia, to seek refunds of union fees that government employees claim were collected from them illegally. 
These cases are active in Pennsylvania, New York, Maryland, and Illinois. In the Maryland case, Liberty Justice Center estimates that almost 10,000 state employees “could recoup up to $7 million that the union took from them.” 
In a related case out of Pennsylvania, Liberty Justice Center estimates that about 2,000 employees “could recoup as much as $1 million in illegal union fees they paid between 2017 and 2018.”
Although Molina’s case is “unique among others’ cases seeking retrospective relief,” his lawyer said in an interview, Molina’s free speech arguments could reverberate across state lines if a federal court in Pennsylvania decides the union should refund dues he paid before resigning his membership.  
Molina argues that he and other government employees were denied due process because the union didn’t apprise them of their First Amendment rights. 
As The Daily Signal previously reported, the SEIU rejected Molina’s resignation letter dated July 16, 2018, saying he had to remain a union member under Pennsylvania’s “maintenance of membership” law, which applied to his contract. 
Molina continued to protest, but Lehigh County dismissed him from his government job as a social services aide in the Office of Children and Youth Services on Aug. 14, 2018, a few weeks after he resigned from the union.
Union Strategy
Molina filed a lawsuit in January against SEIU Local 668, challenging the union’s refusal to allow him to resign his membership and claiming it violated his constitutional rights under the First and 14th amendments. 
The Fairness Center, a nonprofit, public interest law firm based in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, represents Molina in the case filed with the U.S. District Court of the Middle District of Pennsylvania.
In July, Judge Yvette Kane dismissed portions of Molina’s complaint in an opinion that said the former shop steward’s pursuit of “retrospective monetary relief” is “moot” because the SEIU did agree to refund the dues he paid since his resignation from the union. 
Molina also appeared to lack standing, Kane said, because he no longer was a union member when he filed the case. The judge was appointed in 1998 by President Bill Clinton.
Molina’s lawyer declined to reveal the amount of dues or fees involved in his case. 
“SEIU officials are implementing a strategy to avoid court rulings on constitutional issues because they know they would lose,” David Osborne, a lawyer with The Fairness Center, told The Daily Signal in an interview. 
“The judge in this case found in favor of the union and said the fact that [Molina] had gotten his money back means either he doesn’t have standing or the case is moot. These important claims have been dismissed, but the case is still active.”

Because the union “cried uncle” before the court addressed the substantive question of the constitutionality of the “maintenance of membership” provision of  Pennsylvania’s Public Employe Relations Act, Osborne said, the law will remain on the books for the time being.
What the Supreme Court Said
Under the disputed provision, public employees may resign union membership only during a 15-day window before their contracts expire. Public sector unions such as the SEIU stipulate that members must submit a resignation letter by certified mail within that 15-day window.
But for Molina, and other public employees across the nation, the Supreme Court’s ruling in June 2018 in the case of Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees turned out to be a game-changer because it struck down mandatory dues and fees imposed by unions for government employees. 
Liberty Justice Center and National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation represented Mark Janus, an Illinois state employee who objected to AFSCME’s political activities, in his case before the Supreme Court.
Molina told The Daily Signal in an interview that the Supreme Court ruling in favor of Janus provided him with the impetus to resign from the SEIU. 
Although the federal court dismissed Molina’s complaint seeking dues collected since he resigned from the union, his case remains active because the judge said she is willing to entertain his complaint seeking refund of “preresignation dues,” and to consider the possibility that he didn’t get due process.
“It’s not the end of the case for a couple of reasons,” The Fairness Center’s Osborne said. “Molina raised due process arguments because he believes he was not properly informed of his rights, and he has also made a claim seeking dues going back for two years based on the fact that he believes the membership card he signed was invalid. So, his case is not dead.”
In the meantime, SEIU Local 668 appears to have dropped the “maintenance of membership” requirement in its new collective bargaining agreement for state employees over concerns that the state’s legal provision is unconstitutional.
The Daily Signal sought comment from SEIU 668 on the latest developments. The union had not responded by publication time.
National Impact
“Francisco [Molina] believes he’s entitled to a return of pre-Janus dues in part because the SEIU itself recognized that the membership card he signed prior to Janus was invalid,” Osborne said. “So Francisco could make a national impact with his case, but I’d describe the impact as establishing a foothold—not necessarily a right—for any other public employees who want to recover pre-Janus dues payments.”
While Molina and other government employees in Pennsylvania press their cases in court, some state lawmakers have introduced proposed changes to state law that would strike “maintenance of membership” requirements as unconstitutional in light of the high court’s Janus ruling.
State Rep. Kate Klunk, a York County Republican, introduced a measure (HB 785) that would require government employers to notify workers of their rights. State Rep. Greg Rothman, a Cumberland County Republican, introduced a bill (HB 506) to allow government employees to resign from a union anytime they like, without a window to do so or any other restrictions.
Commonwealth Foundation, a free-market think tank based in Harrisburg, released a new report that includes an online interactive database detailing public sector labor laws in all 50 states.
“The Janus decision was a watershed moment for workers’ rights, but our report shows that a lot of heavy lifting still needs to be done to ensure the ruling is enforced,” Charles Mitchell, president and CEO of Commonwealth Foundation, told The Daily Signal in an interview, adding:
Since Pennsylvania is not a right-to-work state, it stands out as one of the states most impacted by the decision. But our ‘maintenance of membership’ law represents a loophole allowing union leaders to keep public employees locked into paying dues and supporting political positions at odds with their own. 
Thankfully, Pennsylvania lawmakers are proposing to do away with resignation restrictions. Other states, especially those friendly to worker freedom, should seize on the Janus ruling as an opportunity to update their own statutes. Union leaders will continue calling in political favors from their allies in government. We can’t let them undermine the workers’ constitutional rights.

"An EPA task force has listed sites requiring the agency’s “immediate and intense attention.” Pictured: Berkeley Pit in Butte, Montana, seen here in July 2017, is a former open-pit copper mine that is part of the largest Superfund site in the U.S.. (Photo: Janie Osborne/Getty Images)
The Environmental Protection Agency has hit the acceleration button to clean up Superfund sites across the country on President Donald Trump’s watch, according to a new task force report detailing progress over the past two years.
The Superfund Task Force, commissioned in May 2017, developed a list of sites requiring the EPA’s “immediate and intense attention.”  Formally known as the “Administrator’s Emphasis List,” EPA officials released it in December 2017, less than a year after Trump took office.
The new task force report spotlights the sprawling Tar Creek Superfund site as one of several where the government has made “substantial progress.” 
Tar Creek includes thousands of acres of lead and zinc mining areas in northeast Oklahoma, southeast Kansas, and southwest Missouri. Because of the site’s “complexity and size,” the report says, a cleanup that goes back to 1984 will take several more years to complete.
The work includes “plugging” abandoned wells and excavating contaminated soil in Ottawa County, Oklahoma. State and federal officials first became aware of potential environmental hazards in 1979, when water began rising to the surface from underground mines. 
The EPA has joined with the state of Oklahoma and the Quapaw tribe of Native Americans in a yearlong effort to formulate a “strategic plan” for Tar Creek after it was added to the agency’s Emphasis List. The strategic plan, which will be released later this month, assesses cleanup needs, risks, and economic potential for the site.
“The work of the Superfund Task Force over the past two years is paying dividends for communities nationwide, including those near the Tar Creek Superfund site,” Regional Administrator Ken McQueen said in a press release. 
“EPA will continue working with our partners toward a cleanup that will benefit the surrounding communities,” McQueen said.
The full Superfund Task Force report, released earlier this month, is available here.
EPA officials say they will continue to update the Emphasis List on a quarterly basis.

The Superfund program dates to 1980, when Congress passed the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. The legislation provides funds for cleaning up thousands of sites across the country laced with such contaminants as lead, asbestos, and dioxin-infused soil, as well as radiation. 
Superfund sites include “manufacturing facilities, processing plants, landfills, and mining sites,” according to the EPA’s website. 
Those sites with known or potential releases of “hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants” are placed on the agency’s National Priorities List.
In addition to its efforts aimed at what it calls expediting cleanup and remediation, the task force said it sought to reinvigorate “responsible party cleanup and reuse,” promote third-party private investment, boost redevelopment and revitalization among communities, and develop a strategy for stakeholder engagement. The EPA’s press release details how officials met some of these goals.
“Thanks to the hard work of EPA career officials, the Superfund Task Force has strengthened the program in numerous ways, from accelerating cleanups to promoting redevelopment to improving community engagement,” EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a written statement, adding:
The agency prepared an online storyboard highlighting the task force’s success stories across the country.

Local conservation efforts, not U.S. government regulations, boosted the population of a bird species in Colorado, one lawmaker said during a roundtable discussion on Capitol Hill focused on practical reforms to the Endangered Species Act.
Other House members who belong to the Congressional Western Caucus, along with “industry stakeholders” and policy analysts, described how the federal government’s designation of “critical habitat” often undermines conservation. 
They also expressed concern about how environmental litigation violates property rights while failing to protect wildlife.
The Sept. 24 roundtable, involving 15 lawmakers and 27 business leaders meeting in the Senate Visitors Center, suggested broad agreement on the need to reform the Endangered Species Act of 1973.
The law has resulted in a recovery rate of only 3% for the wildlife it was designed to protect, according to the Congressional Western Caucus, which counts 72 members of both parties from 32 states and territories. 
Rep. Scott Tipton, R-Colo., vice chairman of the Western Caucus, emphasized that localities and states need to have more latitude to pursue their own conservation efforts without federal intrusion. 
Tipton pointed to efforts in Colorado to preserve the sage grouse, a chicken-like bird species, as an example of successful wildlife protection done locally. He said his state’s pilot program involving ranchers and farmers helped to rehabilitate the species.
“We were seeing the sage grouse numbers go up and growing,” Tipton said. “This ought to be our goal, not [to] have them listed [as endangered] in perpetuity.”
Tipton and other lawmakers present took the opportunity to roll out a draft package of bills designed to “modernize” the Endangered Species Act. 
Tipton already has introduced a bill (HR 6344) to encourage voluntary conservation efforts at the local level.

Ben Goldey, communications director for Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., chairman of the Western Caucus, told The Daily Signal that the caucus is still in the process of building support from “stakeholders” and potential co-sponsors of the new bills.
Once the bills are introduced formally, the caucus will press for hearings and votes, Goldey said.
Rep. Ken Calvert, R-Calif., appeared to speak for many participants when he told fellow Western Caucus members that “we need to get the Endangered Species Act out of the courtroom and empower the agencies administering the law to follow the science and do their jobs.” 
The California Republican also said “powerful special interests are invested in the status quo,” but the status quo “is not working for people or for listed species.” 
Calvert cited figures showing that 2,300 species have been listed as endangered or threatened, while only 72 species have been taken off the list.  
Calvert sponsored a bill (HR 548) that would consolidate management and regulation of the Endangered Species Act within the Fish and Wildlife Service. Currently, that agency, part of the Interior Department, shares responsibility with the National Marine Fisheries Service, part of the Commerce Department.
The draft package of legislation includes 18 other related bills.   
The problems with the Endangered Species Act flow not just from its language but its implementation, Daren Bakst, a senior research fellow with The Heritage Foundation, said during his presentation.
In 2012, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service found that 1,500 acres in Louisiana should be designated as critical habitat for a species known as the dusky gopher frog, Bakst said, citing one example. 
Just one problem, he said: The frog had not been seen in Louisiana for more than 50 years. But because of the “critical habitat” designation, the federal government sought to impose a ban on development that would deprive property owners of more than $30 million in value, the Heritage policy analyst told attendees.
“So, what was the point of this effort?” Bakst asked. “It didn’t serve the interests of the dusky gopher frog, but there are plenty of losers in this effort, including the property owners plus other threatened and endangered species.”
Other listed species lost out, he said, because resources that could have been allocated elsewhere were diverted to an area where the species in question wasn’t even present. 
The example of the dusky gopher frog highlights what Bakst described as “two central problems” with the Endangered Species Act.
“One, the Endangered Species Act doesn’t focus resources where they can be most effective,” he said. “And, two, the law attacks property owners, when the best approach would be to recognize that property owners are integral to preserving species.”
Karen Budd-Falen, the Interior Department’s deputy solicitor for fish, wildlife, and parks, briefed other roundtable participants about the Trump administration’s efforts to reform the law.
“While the administration is committed to protecting threatened or endangered species, that should not be an excuse to hold up a project, to hold up decisions, to hold up ideas, and to hold up things that may actually help species,” Budd-Falen said. “So, we are trying to have specific time frames and keep activities to those time frames. The Department of Interior is not yet done with regulatory changes.”
In August, the Trump administration rolled out a new set of rules that officials said were designed to improve implementation of the Endangered Species Act. 
The new rules clarify the distinction between “threatened” and “endangered” species, and set higher standards for unoccupied areas to be designated as critical habitat. Before federal officials declare a critical habitat, the area must contain one or more physical or biological features essential to conserving the species.

Myron Ebell, director of the Center for Energy and Environment at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian think tank in Washington, told lawmakers he sees cause for encouragement in the Trump administration’s reforms and the package of legislation crafted to modernize the Endangered Species Act. 
Ebell noted that a research paper published last year by the Competitive Enterprise Institute, “’Whatever the Cost’ of the Endangered Species Act, It’s Huge,” offers suggested policy changes to improve the transparency and accountability of listings under law and designations of critical habitat.
“Our motto at CEI has been the ESA is bad for wildlife because it’s often bad for people,” Ebell said. “The reason is because the costs of dealing with endangered species and protecting habitat and recovery are often borne by private landowners.”
Ebell said Congress should authorize “a comprehensive audit” of the costs of the law and pass legislation that compensates property owners for “regulatory takings.” (His complete comments are available here.)
Kathleen Sgamma, president of the Western Energy Alliance, told elected officials that the more than 300 oil and natural gas companies belonging to the trade association are devoted to conservation, but that the Endangered Species Act is skewed against them.
“Our members are happy to go above and beyond to protect species,” Sgamma said. “But not when the Endangered Species Act is weaponized to stop oil and natural gas development. In the West, the Endangered Species Act is used to control land, not primarily to recover species.”
Jonathan Wood, a lawyer with Pacific Legal Foundation, a nonprofit, public interest law firm headquartered in Sacramento, California, expressed support for the draft package of legislation. Until now, the Endangered Species Act has been beset with perverse incentives that need to be changed, he said. 
“One of the most important lessons we’ve learned is that although the law works for preventing the extinction of species, it does not work at promoting recovery,” Wood said. “And the reason for that is the most important factor for recovering species is creating incentives for the private landowner to protect and restore habitat, and we simply don’t do that.”
“I’m glad to see many of the bills that are part of this package aimed at reducing that conflict while providing those better incentives,” he said, adding:
In fact, one of the focus areas I see in the bills is to codify administrative practices developed by Republican and Democratic administrations to make the law work better. That codification is particularly important because it heads off the risk of litigation. Perhaps the biggest effect of the ESA has been to incentivize litigation. As an environmental attorney, I appreciate the work, but in the long run we are not doing well by the species we all care about. As part of that codification process, I think it’s important to codify the recent rules adopted by the Trump administration.
The lawmakers expect opposition on Capitol Hill to the legislative package outlined Tuesday by Western Caucus members. 
Rep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz., warned that her Democratic colleagues are advancing an alternative version of reform that she said would “hurt industries, and quite frankly hurt America” if they ever became law.
Brian Seasholes, executive director of the Southwestern Communities Coalition, testified Tuesday before a House Natural Resources subcommittee, cautioning policymakers to avoid changes to the Endangered Species Act that would impose high costs on landowners without achieving any conservation benefit. 
In his opening statement at the roundtable, Gosar, chairman of the caucus, criticized House Democrats for currying favor with environmental activists.
“Our roundtable with real people impacted by ESA listings is a nice contrast to the hearing currently being held by the Natural Resources Democrats that seeks to move the country backwards by repealing three news regulations just implemented by the Trump administration,” Gosar said. 
“The Democrats’ two main witnesses are from Earthjustice and Defenders of Wildlife, left-wing environmental groups that are more interested in filing frivolous litigation in order to prop up their extremist organizations than they are in doing constructive things that actually help species,” the Arizona Republican said.
The Daily Signal sought comment on Gosar’s characterization from Earthjustice and Defenders of Wildlife. Although environmental litigator  Earthjustice had not responded at publication time, Defenders of Wildlife provided a statement. 
“Defenders of Wildlife is dedicated to the conservation of imperiled wildlife and their habitat, a mission that is supported by millions of Americans,” Bob Dreher, the group’s senior vice president of conservation programs, said.
“We use litigation to hold government officials accountable to the laws enacted by Congress, a public interest that is more urgent now than ever.”

"A sign is well placed as members of the United Auto Workers union protest Monday outside General Motors' assembly plant in Arlington, Texas. (Photo: Ron Jenkins/Getty Images)
Resolving the strike against General Motors that began Monday may be harder because of an internal corruption scandal inside the United Auto Workers.
The strike officially began at midnight, when tens of thousands of workers walked off the factory floors of the multinational automobile manufacturing company headquartered in Detroit. 
Vance Pearson, 58, the UAW’s Region 5 director, was arrested and charged Thursday with embezzlement, money laundering, and other offenses as part of a federal investigation, according to a report in the Detroit Free Press. 
Pearson, of St. Charles, Missouri, is accused of embezzling union money; committing mail and wire fraud; money laundering; and conspiracy, the Free Press reported.
Pearson attended the union negotiations with General Motors on Sunday, which was three days after he was charged by federal prosecutors, the Detroit News reported.  
A series of tweets from the Detroit News details Pearson’s participation and advisory role in the GM contract negotiations. 
A little detail from the sidelines of UAW-GM meetings yesterday… pic.twitter.com/Ys0swDGNAp
UAW’s Region 5 covers 17 states:  Missouri, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Kansas, Colorado, New Mexico, California, Oregon, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Idaho, Alaska, Washington, and Hawaii. 
The Daily Signal sought comment from the UAW on the investigation, but the auto workers union had not responded at publication time. The union did release a statement Thursday addressing the allegations against Pearson, saying:
Our highest priority is maintaining the trust and confidence of United Auto Worker members. While these allegations are very concerning, we strongly believe that the government has misconstrued any number of facts and emphasize that these are merely allegations, not proof of wrongdoing. Regardless, we will not let this distract us from the critical negotiations underway with GM to gain better wages and benefits for the more the 400,000 members of our union.
The UAW, also headquartered in Detroit, claims to have more than 400,000 active members and more than 580,000 retired members in the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico.
Pearson’s arrest is just one part of the story.
The FBI conducted raids in August on six target areas in Michigan, California, Wisconsin, and Missouri, the Detroit News reported. Agents searched the home of UAW President Gary Jones in Detroit and the home of former UAW President Dennis Williams in California. 
Agents also searched the home of Pearson, a former aide to Jones in Region 5. Pearson became regional director after Jones was elected UAW president in June 2018.
The federal investigation, now four years old, seeks to determine whether union leaders received kickbacks in exchange for providing businesses with contracts to produce “union-branded” items, according to the Free Press. 
The investigation reportedly involves all three Detroit automakers: General Motors, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler.  A list of union and company officials charged so far is available here.
Most recently, federal investigators revealed that “four current and former senior officials” were complicit in acts of embezzlement, the Free Press reported. Federal officials have not explicitly named the targeted union leaders.  
But the Detroit News reported that sources said the individual called “UAW Official A” in court documents is Jones, the current union president, and the individual called “UAW Official B” is Dennis Williams, a former UAW president.
A complaint cited by the News says federal investigators found more than $30,000 in cash in UAW Official A’s home along with golf clubs the government said were purchased with union money. 
Andrew Donohue, a special agent with the Labor Department, said in an affidavit that the investigation had found evidence of a “multi-year conspiracy” by UAW officials who sought to embezzle union funds for the purpose of acquiring “luxury items and accommodations” for their personal use.
“The outlay of the funds was not properly approved, was concealed from the view of the UAW members, and used for the personal benefit of the upper echelon of union officials who were elected to represent the members’ best interests above their own,” Donohue’s affidavit says. 
The UAW’s nationwide strike, the first since 2007, involves about 46,000 General Motors workers.

"Mark Janus, a public employee in Illinois who sued a  union for deducting fees to finance political action he disagreed with, in front of the Supreme Court on Feb. 26, 2018. Labor unions are trying to get around his victory, a think tank says. (Photo: Alex Wong/Getty Images)
Labor unions are working with allies in state legislatures to counteract a Supreme Court ruling that invalidated mandatory union dues and fees for government employees, according to a new report from a free-market think tank.
In June 2018, the high court ruled that “agency shop” laws requiring nonunion government employees to pay the union violate the First Amendment rights of those who object to the union’s political agenda.
“Compelling individuals to mouth support for views they find objectionable violates that cardinal constitutional command, and in most contexts, any such effort would be universally condemned,” Justice Samuel Alito said in his majority opinion in Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees.
But in the months following the Supreme Court ruling, the Commonwealth Foundation’s report says, “Big Labor” has sought to exploit “policy weakness” in state laws. 
One example, according to its report: “the lack of clear statutory language prohibiting or limiting union privileges such as release time, the payroll deduction of union dues and other political money, and the scope of collective bargaining.” 
Enactment of these privileges potentially jeopardizes the free speech rights of government employees while adding costs to state budgets, the Commonwealth Foundation argues.
“We are seeing that, post-Janus, government unions and their allies will capitalize on legislative majorities, political weaknesses, and vague labor law to create statutory protections for Big Labor,” the report says, referring to the high court ruling. 
On the other side of the ledger, “the more pro-worker and pro-free market, right-to-work states are less active in solidifying Janus and similar labor reforms,” the report laments.
The Daily Signal sought comment on the report from the Pennsylvania State Education Association, which counts about 180,000 members as the largest public sector union in the state. As of publication time, the teachers union had not responded.  
Figures compiled from Ballotpedia show that, as of early August, 102 “Janus-related bills” have been introduced in state legislatures since the Supreme Court ruled that mandatory union dues violate First Amendment freedoms, the Commonwealth Foundation says. 
The majority of these bills include “union-backed policies” and seven bills “backed by labor leaders” have become law, the report says.
Mark Janus, a child support specialist at the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services, was the lead plaintiff in the case that went to the high court. 
Janus discussed his experiences as a state worker during the August meeting of the American Legislative Exchange Council in Austin, Texas.  ALEC, as the group is known, is a nonpartisan network of state lawmakers who support constitutional, limited government and it produces model legislation along those lines.
Janus warned that union leaders are making a concerted effort to “maintain their monopoly” by refusing to allow public employees to resign their union memberships. 
He expressed concern about the number of bills moving at the state level that could undermine his victory at the Supreme Court.
“We have a monumental task ahead of us,” Janus said.
Janus told The Daily Signal in an interview that checks and balances limit the power of organized labor in the private sector but don’t exist in the public sector.
“In the public sector, there are no checks and balances,” he said, adding:
The unions are negotiating with people who they helped to elect, and these elected officials can either go raise taxes or move items around in their budget or sacrifice needed programs. But in the private sector, there are checks and balances because companies can resist certain demands. They can move their operations, and they can also go out of business.
The Commonwealth Foundation report includes an online, interactive database of labor laws in all 50 states.
“This report warns that a Supreme Court decision is in danger of being undermined by politically savvy actors at the state level,” Charles Mitchell, president and CEO of the Commonwealth Foundation, said in a press release.
 “Advocates for workers cannot rest on their laurels and expect public employees’ newly restored rights to be respected,” Mitchell said. “States must pass laws that enforce and protect the Janus ruling.”
The Supreme Court’s Janus ruling affects about 5 million government employees in 22 states who no longer are required either to join a union or pay related fees as a condition of employment.
Pennsylvania stands out as one state working to implement labor law reforms that would bring it into compliance with federal law. 
State Rep. Kate Klunk, a York County Republican, introduced a bill (HB 785) that would require government employers to notify workers of their rights. 
Pennsylvania also is home to court cases, including this one, involving public employees who allege their unions refused to allow them to resign their memberships.

"President Donald Trump, surrounded by lawmakers at the White House, speaks Feb. 28, 2017, before signing an executive order to begin the rollback of the Obama administration's so-called Clean Water Rule. (Photo: Aude Guerrucci/Getty Images)
Help is on the way for homeowners and landowners, businesses, developers, and farmers who have been victimized by “regulatory uncertainty” and federal “overreach,” Trump administration officials told business leaders Thursday.
EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler and R.D. James, assistant secretary of the Army for civil works, joined members of Congress and leaders of trade associations to announce the completed repeal of the Obama administration’s so-called Clean Water Rule of  2015.
The much-criticized rule had expanded the definition of “waters of the United States”—or WOTUS—under the Clean Water Act. 
The Trump administration’s announcement, which drew criticism from environmental groups, was made before an audience at the National Association of Manufacturers, a trade group based in Washington.
“When President Trump took office, he set in motion a process to remove and replace regulatory burdens that were stifling American innovation and economic development,” Wheeler said, adding:
 The Obama administration’s Waters of the United States definition was at the top of the list. 
We are gathered here today because EPA and the Army [Corps of Engineers] are officially repealing the 2015 definition. Today’s final rule puts an end to an egregious power grab, eliminates an ongoing patchwork of Clean Water Act regulations, and restores a long-standing and familiar regulatory framework while we consider public comments on our proposed revised definition of waters of the United States.
We are delivering on the president’s regulatory-reform agenda.
 >>> Commentary: Why Flushing the ‘Clean Water Rule’ Was the Right Thing to Do
Bonner Cohen, a senior fellow with the National Center for Public Policy Research, told The Daily Signal in an email that the Obama administration had overstepped its authority with its version of the WOTUS rule.
 “Under the guise of ‘clarifying’ two ambiguous Supreme Court rulings from the early 2000s, the Obama administration concocted an elaborate scheme that would have subjected millions of acres of private land to federal zoning,” he said, adding:
Two federal court decisions in the last three months—one in Texas, the other in Georgia—found that the Obama plan to regulate wetlands went far beyond what the Clean Water Act allows.
The confusion over what qualifies as ‘waters of the United States’ under the [Clean Water Act] has bedeviled farmers, ranchers, homebuilders, and others involved in natural resources-related businesses for years.  
While the Obama plan empowered unaccountable federal bureaucrats, the Trump initiative strikes a blow to the administrative regulatory state and lifts a huge burden from rural communities all across the country.
Daren Bakst, a senior fellow with The Heritage Foundation, said in a written statement that the Trump administration’s rule change will help to restore the rule of law in an area where it had gone missing. 
“The EPA and Army Corps of Engineers protect our nation’s waters best when they define what waters are regulated under the Clean Water Act in a manner consistent with the law itself, the U.S. Constitution, and a recognition that clear and objective definitions achieve positive environmental outcomes,” Bakst said, adding: 
 The Obama Clean Water Rule—notorious for garnering widespread opposition—failed on all counts.
In an unprecedented power grab, this rule handed federal bureaucrats authority to regulate almost any water imaginable—creating unnecessary regulatory obstacles for everyone from farmers plowing their land to local governments building ditches for public safety to families building their homes.  
By repealing this rule, the Trump administration has rightfully put an end to this definition of ‘waters of the United States’ that made the EPA and [Army Corps of Engineers] more similar to local zoning boards than federal regulators.  
As the administration formulates its own, more appropriate definition of ‘waters of the United States,’ it should respect the rule of law and provide much-needed clarity to ensure an ordinary person would understand what waters are regulated.
More background on the Trump administration’s efforts to repeal the 2015 WOTUS rule and restore prior regulatory language is available here. 
Mike Howell, a senior adviser for executive branch relations with The Heritage Foundation, attended Wheeler’s announcement Thursday. He credited Trump for delivering on his pledge to provide the American people with regulatory relief.
“File this under promises kept,” Howell said. “The Trump administration today provided regulatory certainty to landowners across the country and undid one of the most egregious power grabs of the Obama administration.”
Not everyone was pleased with the Trump administration’s actions, however. The Natural Resources Defense Council, a New York City-based nonprofit environmental advocacy group, had issued a press release in anticipation of Thursday’s announcement. 
Jon Devine, director of federal water policy at the council, said that the rule change would lead to environmental degradation. 
“The Clean Water Rule represented solid science and smart public policy. Where it has been enforced, it has protected important waterways and wetlands, providing certainty to all stakeholders,” he said, adding: 
The Trump administration’s wild-eyed attempts to reward polluters, however, knows no bounds, so it is repealing these important protections without regard for the law or sound science. 
This unsubstantiated action is illegal and will certainly be challenged in court.
But David Fisher, president of the New York Farm Bureau, supports the rule change. He credits the Trump administration for striking a balance between environmental protection and economic opportunity. 
“Farmers share the goal of protecting the nation’s water, but the 2015 Waters of the United States rule was unreasonable and unworkable,” he said at Thursday’s press event in Washington, adding: 
It made protecting water quality and conservation efforts more difficult and created huge liabilities for farmers, especially when what waters would be regulated under the old rule could not be clearly defined. 
This turned farming into a guessing game on which land use required federal permits and what did not. 
New York Farm Bureau appreciates the EPA’s diligent effort to repeal and clarify the WOTUS rule to ensure a fair and reasonable substitute that protects our water and our ability to work and care for the land.

"A memo signed by the EPA administrator calls for a 30 percent reduction by 2025 in the agency’s requests and funding of research studies using mammals. Pictured: Animal rights activists stage a march Aug. 10 in downtown Los  Angeles. (Photo: Mark Ralston/AFP/Getty Images)
The Environmental Protection Agency’s move to curtail its use of animal testing, ending it within 15 years, is drawing praise from members of Congress and a broad cross-section of advocacy groups.
The Trump administration’s EPA this week set in motion an abrupt change in policy that requires the agency to seek alternative research methods. 
A memo signed by EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler calls for a 30 percent reduction in the agency’s requests and funding of research studies using mammals by 2025, according to a press release. 
Wheeler’s memo Tuesday also calls for the elimination of all requests and funding for mammal studies by 2035. 
Wheeler’s directive puts the onus on the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention and the Office of Research and Development to produce “measurable impacts in the reduction of animal testing while ensuring protection of human health and the environment.”
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, the prominent nonprofit group promoting animal rights, is among advocacy groups expressing strong support for the EPA  initiative.
“PETA is celebrating the EPA’s decision to protect animals certainly—but also humans and the environment—by switching from cruel and scientifically flawed animal tests in favor of modern, non-animal testing methods,” Amy Clippinger, director of PETA’s Regulatory Testing Department, said in a written statement. 
Clippinger has a doctorate in cellular and molecular biology and genetics.
“PETA will be helping regulatory agencies and companies switch to efficient and effective, non-animal testing approaches and working toward a day when all animal tests are only found in history books,” Clippinger said.
Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., said he sees an opportunity for other federal agencies to follow suit.
“I am thrilled to hear that the EPA is greatly reducing its reliance on animal tests, and promoting non-animal-based research at universities,” Gaetz said, adding:
Animal testing is often cruel and painful, with limited applicability to human health outcomes. Non-animal research is more accurate, more cost-effective, and more humane. I commend the EPA for their decision, and hope other departments and agencies will soon follow suit.
Wheeler also said Tuesday that his agency will provide $4.25 million in grants to five universities through the agency’s Science to Achieve Results Program. 
The grant money will be used “to advance the research and development of alternative test methods for evaluating the safety of chemicals that will minimize, and hopefully eliminate, the need for animal testing,” Wheeler said. 
With an eye toward taxpayer protection, the White Coat Waste Project also had words of praise for Wheeler and his agency. 
Anthony Bellotti, president and founder of the taxpayer watchdog group, which counts 2 million supporters, said the EPA’s action represents “the most comprehensive and aggressive plan in U.S. history to cut wasteful animal testing.”
A “supermajority” of Americans in all political parties support the goal, Bellott said.
“The Trump administration has shown outstanding leadership to curb unnecessary taxpayer-funded animal tests and this development at the EPA is another remarkable win for animals, taxpayers, industry, and the environment,” he said.

"""While I was able to resign my union membership, I was still required to pay a union fee as 'fair share' for union representation,"" writes Greg Hartnett. Pictured above: Teachers with the ASPIRA charter school network in Chicago hold a rally on March 17, 2017. (Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images)

Greg Hartnett

Greg Hartnett is a teacher from Homer-Center School District in Pennsylvania and the plaintiff in Hartnett v. Pennsylvania State Education Association.
One year ago, the Supreme Court
ruled that public-sector employees like me, who are not union members, don’t
have to pay union fees in order to be employed. 
That ruling is already benefiting me and countless others. But unfortunately, Pennsylvania law hasn’t caught up with the times.
For decades, teacher contracts often required even non-union employees to pay fees to a union or lose our jobs—regardless of whether we agreed with the union’s positions. But because of the Supreme Court’s 2018 ruling in Janus v. AFSCME, Council 31, those forced union fees are now unconstitutional.
The ruling was of particular
interest to me because in 2017, I, too, filed
a lawsuit seeking relief from this unconstitutional practice. 
During my 20 years as a public school teacher, I was compelled to send a portion of each paycheck to the teachers union, even though I did not agree with how the union leaders represented me during various negotiations. They blatantly ignored my opinions and worked to maintain their own power. 
While I was able to resign my union membership, I was still required to pay a union fee as “fair share” for union representation—representation I did not ask for, want, or need. 
In my lawsuit, I joined with three other Pennsylvania teachers to challenge these forced union fees in court.
As my case waited in a lower court, the Supreme Court’s decision in Janus answered the question we were asking: Can teachers—or any public-sector employee—be compelled to fund union activities, many of which are political in nature? 
The answer was simple: No. Doing so violates employees’ guaranteed rights to free speech and association.
Despite the court’s ruling, many of my colleagues remain unaware of their new freedom to not pay. Most haven’t heard of the Janus ruling, and union leaders aren’t telling them about it. 
As a result, many teachers continue to fund union activities they disagree with, unaware that they have another choice—resign from the union and pay nothing.
To make matters even more confusing, Pennsylvania state law still authorizes forced union fees for public-sector employee contracts, which it calls “fair share” fees. 
While Janus should apply to Pennsylvania law—many union officials have publicly admitted as much—the Supreme Court’s decision did not specifically analyze Pennsylvania law and nullify any of its provisions. 
That means any teacher trying to
understand their rights would soon encounter a valid state law and, in many
cases, a contract with their employer requiring that non-members pay fees. 
In fact, the Pennsylvania State Education Association and some of its local unions are continuing to include fair share provisions for non-union members in some of their new contracts right now—even after Janus. 
As absurd as it sounds, they are completely ignoring the Supreme Court’s ruling and are knowingly negotiating for unconstitutional provisions in employment contracts. 
This is why my own case, Hartnett v. PSEA is still relevant. It’s why we are now appealing to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
My case is about bringing the Janus ruling to Pennsylvania and affirming public-sector employees’ rights at the state level. Specifically, we are asking the courts to declare state fair share provisions unconstitutional and block teachers unions from including them in future contracts. 
While one court has ruled that the Janus decision doesn’t require this, the facts, as noted above, prove otherwise. And a recent court ruling in California indicates there are legal grounds for my continued appeal. 
I take great pride in my work as
a teacher to thousands of Pennsylvania students. It’s an honor to have the
confidence of both the parents and administrators in Indiana County’s
Homer-Center School District where I teach. 
It’s been a full year since the Janus decision was handed down, and I believe that workers across the country are benefiting. It’s time for Pennsylvania to catch up.

"The father of a 14-year-old on Hopewell Valley Central High's freshman football team objected that the school district allowed a ""young lady"" to use the boys' locker room. (Photo: Hopewell Valley Central High School website)
HOPEWELL, N.J.—Freshmen football players, changing in their high school locker room at the beginning of the school year, were startled to encounter a girl who said she identifies as a boy.
The  father of one of the players wrote to the school’s principal and athletic director to express concern about the “young lady” and the “comfort” of the boys, most of whom were 14 at the time and “wondering what was going on.”
“I think you are doing a disservice to the kids by not having at least a casual conversation with them regarding their comfort in the locker as well as treating others with the same respect they want while changing clothes,” the player’s father said in an email to Tana Smith, principal at Hopewell Valley Central High School, and Tripp Becker, the athletic director.
The father asked whether the high school’s football coach and district administrators had planned to provide the team with a “heads up” about the school district’s new transgender policy, adopted three months earlier by the Hopewell Valley Regional Board of Education, and were ready to field questions or concerns.
The answer was no.
David Machin, coach of Hopewell Valley’s freshman football team, emailed team parents Sept. 20, 2016, to say there would be no public announcement clarifying school rules on gender. Machin wrote team parents:
I believe the district policy (which follows federal law) is that any student may use whatever locker room/bathroom that he/she identifies with. I believe that there is no requirement for a public announcement regarding this type of situation or even a ‘heads up,’ so to speak.

The reason for the silence, Hopewell parents who spoke with The Daily Signal said, is that a LGBT advocacy group appears to exercise significant influence on school board members and administrators in the Hopewell Valley Regional School District, especially Superintendent Thomas Smith.
Garden State Equality, headquartered in Asbury Park, New Jersey, describes itself as “a statewide advocacy and education organization for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community.”
The Hopewell Valley school board adopted the transgender policy June 20, 2016, one year ago Tuesday.
The action came five weeks after the Obama administration warned local school districts to spell out transgender students’ access to the rest room and locker room facilities of their choice, or risk loss of federal dollars.
Four days after the school board vote, Garden State Equality tweeted a message featuring a photo of its executive director, Christian Fuscarino (at left) with “friends” from the Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network:

The incident in Hopewell Valley Central High’s locker room occurred just a few days after the 2016-2017 school year opened. It set off a chain of email communications, copies of which The Daily Signal has obtained through New Jersey’s Open Public Records Act.
Parents across the state should be concerned about how much influence Garden State Equality exerts over “key decision-makers” in local school districts at the expense of sound policy, Len Deo, executive director of the New Jersey Family Policy Council, told The Daily Signal in an interview.
While opposing sides should be heard in public forums, Deo said, he sees a danger that some transgender policies will infringe free speech:
Some of these policies have gender identity pronoun requirements, and we have to ask what the ramifications are if someone does not comply for reasons of conscience. Who is the authority and what are the ramifications? What does this mean for free speech? If a school district suddenly says that gender is fluid and it’s one thing today and another tomorrow, this leads to all kinds of confusion and different interpretations.

While it’s fine to accept input from advocacy groups, the onus is on school board members and superintendents to look out for the public interest instead of advancing narrow special interests, Deo told The Daily Signal
“Let’s not forget who is paying the taxes for these school districts,” he said, adding:
The parents are paying the taxes and they deserve to be heard instead of being silenced. I think one difference between us and Garden State Equality is we are not trying to manipulate school boards and superintendents. We are trying to give parents a voice.
The Hopewell Valley district serves about 4,000 students from preschool through 12th grade in suburban Mercer County about 10 miles south of Princeton.
The Hopewell Valley player’s father, who asked not to be identified, says he decided to press his point because taxpayers should be heard.
“I also went to meet with the principal and the athletic director to express my concerns,” the father said in an interview with The Daily Signal.
“They insisted this student was not actually changing in the locker room, and I told them that they were wrong, because all of the kids told me otherwise. Instead of having an intelligent conversation where we can all address the concerns of students and parents, they just want to stonewall.”
He added:
I’ve coached baseball for 14 years now, and I’m someone who understands kids. We are talking about something that’s occurring during their formative years, and it’s understandable that they would have questions. Honestly, I think they’ve been a lot more mature about this than our own school administrators, who are pushing their own policy agenda. [The administrators] seem to only be concerned with making one student comfortable in a locker room and not the rest. But I think there are ways to make everyone comfortable.

School Board Veteran Challenges Policy
Hopewell Valley’s nine-member school board approved the policy on “Transgender and Gender Nonconforming Students” at its regular meeting one year ago, on June 20, 2016.
School Board President Lisa Wolff joined six other members to OK the policy, while one member abstained and another was absent. The vote occurred little more than a month after the Obama administration mandated such policies for schools that wanted to keep getting federal dollars.
The Hopewell Valley policy says students are responsible for determining their own gender identity, except  “in the case of young students not yet able to advocate for themselves”—and then a parent or guardian will make that determination. The policy doesn’t specify any ages.
So long as administrators determine that a student is sincere, the school should accept that student’s “asserted gender identity,” the policy says.
Werner Graf, a former school board member with two daughters in the school system, was the only resident who showed up at the meeting last June to speak out against the transgender policy and the manner in which the system implemented it.
“I took the three minutes the board allotted me to make points about legal liability, privacy, and safety, and suggested the policy be sent back to a larger committee for review,” Graf recalled in an interview with The Daily Signal.  “It wasn’t a radical request, especially since the debate thus far was apparently void of any input from concerned parents.”
During time set aside for public comment, Graf warned the school board of the “bad optics” of the LGBT advocacy group’s involvement,  given that the school board is supposed to be nonpartisan:
You’ve allowed this Garden State Equality group to come in, and Garden State Equality is clearly a partisan organization. They are a self-described advocacy group for a set of people.
The board gave Garden State Equality “preferential treatment” that “sets a very bad precedent” for how public policy decisions are made in the school district, Graf added.

A Receptive Audience  
An analysis of email records obtained by The Daily Signal in a request under New Jersey’s Open Public Records Act shows Garden State Equality began burrowing in as a policymaking entity for the Hopewell Valley school district just over two years ago, in March 2015.
The emails show Lee Rosenfield, who sits on the board of Garden State Equality and has two children in the school district, invited Smith to join him at a fundraising “cocktail party” in Lambertville, New Jersey, for the LGBT advocacy group.
Rosenfield also invited the school superintendent to meet with Andrea Bowen, then the group’s executive director, so she could explain “new plans to combat ongoing bullying, discrimination, and insensitivity in New Jersey’s schools.”
Although he said he couldn’t attend, Smith apparently remained receptive to input from the LGBT group over the next several months. In a Sept. 28, 2015, email to Aaron Potenza, director of programs for Garden State Equality, the superintendent asked whether Potenza would like to attend a “leadership team” meeting.
“I would be honored if you would join one of our leadership team meetings to participate in a discussion about current issues facing students today,” Smith wrote. “We are a pretty informal group and we really enjoy learning from leaders in the field of education.”
Smith was responding to Potenza’s email to superintendents across the state, which sought their participation in an LGBT “needs assessment” program.
Most New Jersey school districts, including Hopewell Valley, subscribe to a state-based education policy consulting service, Strauss Esmay Associates, which has circulated its own transgender policy recommendations.
In an email Oct. 2, 2015, to school superintendents, Potenza explained why Garden State Equality objected to Strauss Esmay’s model policy. He said those recommendations fell short because they gave too much latitude to parents and school officials to determine a student’s gender identity:
Strauss Esmay’s policy contains confusing and potentially harmful language that bases students’ rights on whether they are seen as conforming to masculine or feminine stereotypes associated with their gender identity. Schools should not be in the business of policing students’ gender presentation.
Potenza concluded by inviting Smith and other superintendents to “work with” Garden State Equality “to help create better policy.”
Garden State Equality recommends its own transgender policy for schools and a guidance document interpreting state and federal laws. Little daylight appears between what the Hopewell Valley school board adopted and what the LGBT group proposed.
As of 2016, the group estimates, 25 of the 584 operating school districts in New Jersey had moved to implement policies spelling out the rights of transgender students.
Garden State Equality “provided training and consultation on LGBT students to over 50 school districts in New Jersey” in 2015 and 2016, according to the records obtained by The Daily Signal.
Fuscarino, the group’s executive director since April 2016, said he views Hopewell Valley’s transgender school policy, and similar policies throughout the state, as a success.
“We’ve had nothing but positive feedback from individuals who worked with school districts regarding our policy,” Fuscarino said in an interview Friday. “We do this work because we want a safe environment for all students.”

Smith Opposes Another State’s Law
At the behest of Garden State Equality in a court case, Smith, the Hopewell Valley superintendent, joined an amicus brief opposing North Carolina’s so-called bathroom bill, commonly known as HB 2.
The legislation, which North Carolina lawmakers passed in March 2016, prohibited transgender individuals from using restroom facilities in government buildings that did not correspond with the gender on their birth certificate.
Smith quickly signed on to what became known as the “school administrators’ brief” in cooperation with the San Diego-based law firm of Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP.
On May 24, 2016, Potenza emailed Smith to introduce the Hopewell Valley superintendent to Asaf Orr, who specialized in transgender youth as a staff lawyer at the National Center for Lesbian Rights, which was working with allied groups to put together the amicus brief.
“Put me down! I will sign,” Smith wrote in response that same day.
In a May 26, 2016, email exchange with Wolff, the school board president, Smith discussed the amicus brief and said: “Clearly I won’t ever be able to work in North Carolina.”
As it turns out, Smith was the only school superintendent in New Jersey to sign on to the amicus brief, and he explained why in his email to Wolff:
Actually I am representing the state. They only wanted one from New Jersey. Apparently they want N.J. because of our governor.
Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican in his second term, was a candidate for president last year and threw his support to Donald Trump after dropping out of the race.
Garden State Equality’s Potenza wrote:
The focus of the brief is using the stories of administrators who have implemented trans-inclusive policies to show the court that all of the claims being made by the state [of North Carolina] about ‘common sense’ and the like is actually nonsense and pretext for discrimination.
But at the time Smith agreed to sign the legal brief, his own school district did not officially have a “trans-inclusive” policy in place. That came a few weeks later.
‘Fearmongering’ and ‘Hatemongering’
In a video of the June 2016 school board meeting linked below, Graf and other speakers begin their remarks at the 26-minute mark.
“As I understand the policy, having read it, a child can go into a locker room or bathroom based on the gender that they identify with,” Graf, the former board member, said. “However, that is subject to some [administrative] overview. If you deny one child and allow another, I don’t see how the board can put itself in that position without potentially having a lawsuit on its hands.”

Graf added that the policy could jeopardize students, especially girls, who are put in a position where they must undress in close proximity to males who say they identify as females. Girls, he said, should not be forced to expose themselves in such a situation:
You are opening up [to others] a safe space for the ladies that I don’t think has to be opened up. There are ways to do this in a way that doesn’t force kids into the bathroom that they are uncomfortable with, but at the same time doesn’t put their rights as something that supersedes other people’s rights.
Graf encouraged board members to carefully consider potential problems that might arise involving staff members, such as janitors, who are considerably older than students. Under the policy, a male janitor who identifies as a woman couldn’t be told to stay out of a girls’ locker room, he warned.
Rosenfield, the board member of Garden State Equality who spearheaded the LGBT group’s outreach to the school district, followed Graf’s remarks with comments supporting the transgender policy.
He denounced Graf’s concerns and request for further review as “hatemongering” and “fearmongering,” turning toward Graf repeatedly during his time at the microphone.
When Graf objected to this characterization, Wolff quickly cut him off, saying he already had his time for public comment.
“He was talking to us,” the school board president scolded Graf, referring to Rosenfield. “He might have looked at you. This is public comment. You do not get a second chance to talk. I didn’t hear any comments directed at you. We don’t have dialogues with members of the public.”
Graf told The Daily Signal:
This ‘hatemongering’ narrative is a typical bullying tactic which erodes civil debate on important issues. The superintendent and board are under the illusion that they are marching across a bridge in Selma. They’re not. All they are doing is reducing the safety, comfort, and privacy of the kids in our district, especially our girls. They’ve also set an extremely bad precedent by letting a political activist group essentially write the policy for them.

Rosenfield figures prominently in the emails obtained by The Daily Signal under the state’s Open Public Records Act.
“In my view you are a rock star, Tom,”  the LGBT activist said in an March 18, 2015, email to the superintendent. “I am so impressed with everything you do.”
Rosenfield repeated the “rock star” compliment in a Sept. 1, 2016, email to Smith, who emailed back to thank Rosenfield for the connection with Garden State Equality.
“I was asked to sign an amicus brief as part of the lawsuit [in North Carolina] regarding transgender equity,” Smith wrote. “I am the only New Jersey superintendent asked and I was proud to sign my name.”
The superintendent dismissed Graf’s concerns expressed during the public meeting several months earlier, emailing Rosenfield:
We do go to outside groups. That’s not unique here. But it’s up to us how we take that feedback. We are pretty darn objective and not swayed by any particular organization.
But if the superintendent is objective, why was he swayed to join an amicus brief in a court fight and take sides in a national debate over transgender policies extending beyond schools?
Wolff, the school board president, declined to answer that question from The Daily Signal in an email response.  But she did defend Hopewell Valley’s transgender policy, saying it formalized practices already in place:
Since the policy basically documented what our district was already doing, the policy implementation did not require sweeping changes. Not surprisingly, now almost one year since the policy was adopted, I am aware of no student complaints or issues.
The transgender policy made media headlines when it was originally passed and I received questions in the months that followed, but other than a few letters of support from people simply confirming that we had a policy on the books, there have been no further concerns raised.
The Daily Signal also invited comment from the superintendent, the freshman football coach, and Garden State Equality officials, including Potenza and Rosenfield.
To date, only Garden State Equality’s executive director, Fuscarino, has responded.
‘Very Bipartisan’
Garden State Equality has not concealed its Democratic Party leanings.
The LGBT advocacy group actively campaigned against two Republican incumbents in Congress, Reps. Scott Garrett and Chris Smith, during the 2016 election cycle. In press releases and media statements, it described both congressmen as “repulsive,” “bigoted,” and “homophobic” proponents of “hate.”
Campaign finance records show Garden State Equality has funneled almost $50,000 to the Democratic Party and its candidates since 2007, and almost none to Republicans.
The organization draws substantial donations from left-leaning foundations inside and outside New Jersey, including $10,000 from Tides, an organization financed in part by hedge fund manager George Soros. With allied groups such as its education fund, Garden State Equality has received nearly $3 million from these foundations since 2005, according to the Washington-based Capital Research Center.
But Fuscarino said the donations in prior years weighted toward Democrats, and the donations from liberal foundations, occurred before he became executive director and “are not reflective of the current leadership.”
“We used to have a political action committee and we don’t have a political action committee anymore,” he said. “We don’t make those kinds of donations anymore. We have been very bipartisan in our efforts more recently.”
Fuscarino added:
We are living in a time now when there is more support for LGBT causes on both sides of the aisle. All of the Republicans, except for two, were supportive of LGBT causes to a certain degree, so we endorsed them.
LGBT advocates, including Fuscarino (second from left in this tweeted photo), took part in an annual Equality March along the boardwalk in Asbury Park two days before the Hopewell Valley school board’s vote:

Latitude
The Daily Signal may not have received all  documents from the Hopewell Valley school district that are responsive to its request under the Open Public Records Act.
In a letter, Robert Colavita, the school district’s business administrator and board secretary, said the district isn’t required to read through all potentially relevant documents.
“While we are required to search for documents, we are not required to read documents to determine whether they are responsive to the OPRA request,” Colavita wrote, referring to the Open Public Records Act. “This would constitute research not required under OPRA.”
As for the father who first registered concern about the locker room at Hopewell Valley Central High School where unsuspecting freshman football players came across a transgender student? He insists the school district should have informed students and parents of the policy and its implications.
In his Sept. 19, 2016, email to the school’s principal and athletic director, he had written: “I think that is the primary reason to have teachers and administrators in the school.”
The federal government’s interpretation of the law cited by Machin, the school’s freshman football coach, has changed radically in the past few months.
On Feb. 22, Trump rescinded President Barack Obama’s 2016 guidelines reinterpreting Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 to include protection against discrimination based on a student’s gender identity, rather than biological sex. Little more than a week later, the U.S. Supreme Court declined an opportunity to rule decisively on transgender rights in a school system case out of Virginia.
So long as litigation continues to gestate at the federal level, New Jersey school districts have latitude to craft their own policies with an eye toward state law. In 2007, legislators amended state law to prohibit discrimination based on “gender identity or expression.”
“When I met with the principal and the athletic director, they told me they were going to be talking with their lawyer about whatever discussion they had with me,” the player’s father told The Daily Signal.
“It’s fine if they want to do that, but it seems to me they are only working to make one student comfortable in the locker room, and not all the rest.”

"Francisco Molina, a former shop steward, ran into a problem when he resigned from SEIU Local 668 last summer and demanded that the union in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, stop deducting dues from his paycheck. (Photo: The Fairness Center)
Francisco Molina, a social worker for more than 12 years in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, grew dissatisfied with his government employee union and tried to resign from it last summer rather than continue to pay dues. State law wouldn’t let him leave the union, and taking a stand cost him his job.
Although he used to be a shop steward for Service Employees International Union Local 668 and lobbied on the union’s behalf in both Harrisburg and Washington, Molina says, he had decided to break with the SEIU in response to actions he viewed as hostile to free speech rights. 
Molina, who was a social services aide in the Lehigh County Office of Children and Youth Services,  says he also discovered that fellow union leaders did not provide rank-and-file members with accurate information.
“When I joined the union, I didn’t agree with their principles or values,” Molina, 52, told The Daily Signal in an interview. “But I wanted to make a difference with myself and my co-workers, and I felt that if I got involved, I could make some changes from within as a shop steward.”
“But my personal values never matched the union’s,” Molina said. “The further I got up the chain of command, I realized it was all an illusion and that what they were presenting to the rank and file was not true.”
When SEIU Local 668 asked Molina and co-workers to sign a new membership card in January 2018, he balked after carefully reviewing the language on the card. 
Molina, who has three daughters with his wife of 32 years, says he refused to sign because he would be obligated to pay dues regardless of his membership status.
“Even if I wanted to go work for someone else, the union would have the ability to take money straight from my personal account if I had signed,” he told The Daily Signal.
SEIU Local 668 declined to comment for this report.
‘A Pre-Emptive Campaign’
It’s not just that leaders of public sector unions in Pennsylvania are reluctant to allow Molina and other members to resign, but that a state law locks in government employees to pay union dues against their will.
Now a federal court could rule that unconstitutional, or state legislators could amend the law to secure free speech rights. 
A section of state law specifies that public employees may resign union membership only during a 15-day window before their contracts expire.
Public sector unions such as the Service Employees International Union stipulate that Molina and other members must submit a resignation letter by certified mail within that 15-day window. 
But this “maintenance of membership” provision of Pennsylvania’s Public Employees Relations Act 195 doesn’t require unions to inform workers of the resignation window. And the state’s public payroll systems automatically deduct union dues from paychecks until employees, including Molina, find a way to unwind themselves from membership. 
Even then, government workers who choose not to belong to unions have been required to pay “fair share” fees to keep their jobs.
What this means for Pennsylvania civil servants such as Molina—who differ with union leaders on a range of policy questions—is that they must spend part of their work day paying for political activism by the union that they don’t support.  

“They had this emergency mandatory meeting in January [2018], where they said the old [membership] cards were invalid and we had to sign new ones,” Molina said of Local 668. “What they were doing was a pre-emptive campaign to avoid the legal ramifications of an unfavorable ruling in the Janus case.”
In that case, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June 2018 that “agency shop” laws requiring nonunion government workers to pay union fees violate the First Amendment rights of those who object to the political agenda of the union.
Justice Samuel Alito, author of the court’s opinion in Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, cited the First Amendment’s guarantees of freedom of speech and freedom of association in his ruling. 
Alito made the point that individuals are not just free to speak, but also free to “refrain from speaking” and to “eschew association for expressive purposes.” 
The labor laws at issue in the Janus case violate the “constitutional command” protecting citizens against government coercion, Alito argued: “Compelling individuals to mouth support for views they find objectionable violates that cardinal constitutional command, and in most contexts, any such effort would be universally condemned.”
Lawmakers Respond
Rep. Greg Rothman, a Republican state lawmaker from Pennsylvania’s Cumberland County, introduced a bill to amend the law to allow government employees to resign from a union anytime they like, without a window to do so or any other restrictions.
“The public sector unions in Pennsylvania are extremely political, and collectively they are probably the biggest spender on political campaigns in the state,” Rothman said in a phone interview, adding:
They take political positions, which may not in a lot of cases represent the political views of their workers. Part of the First Amendment isn’t just about what I can say, but what someone says on my behalf, and you shouldn’t have your money going towards opinions that aren’t your own. You should also have a right to resign from an organization that doesn’t reflect your views, and you should not be required to be part of an organization in order to have a job.
Rothman’s bill, HB 506, is one of several that seek to turn the Supreme Court’s Janus ruling into law by amending existing Pennsylvania statutes.
State Rep. Kate Klunk, a York County Republican, introduced a measure, HB 785, that would require public sector employers to notify workers of their rights.
“The notice requirement is very simple and the onus is all on the public sector employer—be it the school district, municipality, or state government—to inform nonunion members that they are not required to make a payment to the union unless they affirmatively consent to do so,” Klunk told The Daily Signal in a phone interview. 
“The unions have no express duty in any of these notices, as it’s only the employer that’s required to send out these notices. This is not pro-union or anti-union. This is just about telling employees what their rights are.”
As an attorney, Klunk has expressed concern that Pennsylvania will continue to face costly litigation until state laws are changed to conform with the Supreme Court ruling that struck down mandatory union dues.
Pennsylvania at Epicenter 
The Janus ruling provided Molina with the opening he had sought to make a clean break. 
In letter dated July 16, 2018, Molina resigned from SEIU Local 668. Although he wanted to quit the union before the high court’s decision, he knew he would have been compelled to pay “fair share” fees as a nonmember. 
In his letter, Molina informed the SEIU that he wanted the deductions of dues to stop immediately. But they didn’t.
“Even after the Janus ruling, they continued to take dues out of my paycheck,” Molina said of the union. “According to their definition, after I resigned, I would been a nonunion member. There were others who resigned, but I was the most outspoken. I encouraged other workers to read the new cards carefully.”
The SEIU rejected Molina’s resignation letter, arguing that he had to remain a member under the “maintenance of membership” provision that applies to his contract. 
Molina continued to protest, and was dismissed from his Lehigh County government job last summer, a few weeks after resigning from the union. Before 2004, he had worked in the private sector but didn’t belong to a union. 
In January, Molina filed a lawsuit against SEIU Local 668, challenging the union’s refusal to allow him to resign and alleging that the union violated his constitutional rights under the First and 14th amendments. 
“Under my contract, it says if I don’t pay my dues, the union can ask for my termination,” Molina told The Daily Signal. “That’s what I believe ended up happening in the end. I was terminated. I cannot work as a civil servant again for the state of Pennsylvania until this case is resolved.” 
The Fairness Center, a nonprofit, public interest law firm based in Harrisburg, represents Molina.
“What Francisco [Molina] did for himself here was wonderful because he refused to sign a card that would have locked him into paying union dues regardless of his membership,” said David Osborne, president and general counsel of the Fairness Center. “He read the language and decided it didn’t make sense for him. So, what this case is about is a statute in Pennsylvania called ‘maintenance of membership’ that gives unions the right to keep members from resigning for years at a time.”
The Legal Landscape
The Fairness Center filed a separate but related class action lawsuit against Local 668 on behalf of public employees, challenging the “maintenance of membership” law on constitutional grounds. Both cases fit into a larger national picture.
The Daily Signal sought a response from SEIU Local 668 on the specifics of  this article. The union responded to the request, but declined to comment.
Two other organizations—Liberty Justice Center, a nonprofit, public interest law center based in Illinois, and the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation—also entered the fray in Pennsylvania to challenge the legality of the continued deduction of union dues that have cost government workers thousands of dollars.
This was a significant development because the two legal advocacy groups partnered to represent Mark Janus, a child support specialist for Illinois state government, in the Supreme Court case that overturned mandatory union dues for government workers. 
Liberty Justice Center has filed two lawsuits, one in Lebanon County on behalf of four mental health workers, and another in Philadelphia on behalf of a caseworker for the state’s Department of Health and Human Services. 
Both of the center’s lawsuits cite the high court’s ruling in Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees in arguing against the deduction of unions dues on First Amendment grounds. Both cases also challenge the unions’ current standing as the exclusive representative of the government workers who sued.

For its part, National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation took up the case of a school bus driver in the Wallingford-Swarthmore School District who is asking for a refund of union fees that were withdrawn from his paycheck after he resigned his union membership. 
The foundation filed suit against Teamsters Local 312 and the school district on behalf of the bus driver, who resigned from the Teamsters after the Janus ruling. The foundation also set up a website called MyJanusRights.org.
‘A Real Pushback’
The lead plaintiff in the Janus suit has some advice for unions that he shared with The Daily Signal.
“The public sector unions have been spending money on litigation, fighting the Janus decision and fighting workers that are resigning,” Janus said in an email. “Wouldn’t that money be better spent on representing their membership in matters that would better provide for the unions’ original purpose?”
Janus added:
It is cumbersome to resign from public sector unions. Now there is a real pushback by the public sector unions to prevent workers from leaving, in spite of the Janus ruling. What they are doing is denying these workers their First Amendment rights.

Meanwhile, the Fairness Center continues to cut its own path with active Janus-related litigation against AFSCME Council 89 and AFSCME Council 13, both in Pennsylvania.
Another active case that could have reverberations across Pennsylvania concerns a liquor store clerk, John Kabler, who alleges that Local 1776 of the United Food and Commercial Workers gave him false information and misled him into joining the union. Kabler also claims union leaders resisted his efforts to resign, and in March the center filed suit against the union on his behalf.
The public interest firm also settled some Pennsylvania cases in which the union agreed to allow their client to resign without paying more union dues. But these settlements were reached before the constitutionality of the “maintenance of membership” statute faced judicial scrutiny.
Charles Mitchell, president and CEO of the Commonwealth Foundation, a free market think tank based in Harrisburg, said he thinks he knows why.
“There’s a reason why unions like AFSCME and SEIU are relying upon maintenance of membership rules and the window periods in Pennsylvania,” Mitchell said in a phone interview. “It’s because it’s the next obvious piece of coercion available to them.”
“I think it’s very clear that these restrictions are not consistent with workers’ rights and with the First Amendment,” he said. “I also believe one of the many people in Pennsylvania challenging these restrictions will be successful. The Janus opinion is extremely important, and Mark Janus is a hero.”
While the Fairness Center continues to apply pressure in court, Mitchell sees another ace in the hole available to proponents of labor reform in the form of the new legislative proposals.
“There are many lawmakers who are now standing up and saying our laws are inconsistent with the Janus decision and we need to fix them and inform workers of their rights,” he said. “They are doing this despite all the money and influence available to public sector unions, and that’s a very positive development.”
Klunk, the Republican lawmaker from York County, would like to see her bill become law this year. Although Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, has received political support from organized labor, Klunk says she is hopeful the governor will allow the bill to move forward.
Even if Wolf doesn’t the sign the measure, it could become law without his signature if it passes both houses of the Pennsylvania General Assembly.
“Right now, we are clogging up our courts with additional cases over an issue that has already has been settled at the federal level before the Supreme Court,” Klunk said. “This benefits no one, and my bill in its current form repeals an unconstitutional provision of our state law. Wolf is the governor of all the people, not just the unions, and he could sign the bill or choose not to sign it and let it become law.”
The Daily Signal contacted Wolf’s office by phone seeking comment for this story and emailed his press secretary, J.J. Abbott, asking whether the governor has a position on the legislative proposals to amend Act 195. 
The Daily Signal also asked Abbott whether the governor had any concerns about the costs of litigation attached to a labor issue that already had been settled at the federal level. Abbott had not responded by publication time. 
SEIU Local 668 has filed a motion seeking dismissal of Molina’s case. Osborne, head of the Fairness Center, said he expects the court to make a ruling on the union’s motion within the next month.
“The union has to bear a very heavy burden to demonstrate the case is moot  and they will no longer violate the law,” Osborne said. “I don’t think there is any way the union can bear that burden.”

"The Supreme Court rules for the free speech rights of those who don't belong to public employee 
 unions in Janus v. AFSCME. Pictured: Demonstrators congregate outside Feb. 26 as the justices hear the case.  (Photo: Kevin Mooney/The Daily Signal) 
The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 Wednesday that nonunion government workers can’t be forced to pay dues or other fees to support a union, further diminishing the power of organized labor and setting up what right-to-work proponents called the “hard work” of protecting free speech rights for the nation’s government employees.
Right-to-work advocates also expressed concern about what they see as ongoing conflicts of interest between public employee unions and the government officials whom those same unions help elect into positions of influence over union contracts negotiated at taxpayer expense.
In their decision in Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, the justices said “agency shop” laws requiring nonunion government workers to pay union fees violate the First Amendment rights of workers who object to the political agenda of public employee unions.
“Compelling individuals to mouth support for views they find objectionable violates that cardinal constitutional command, and in most contexts, any such effort would be universally condemned,” wrote Justice Samuel Alito, author of the court’s opinion.
Alito was joined in the majority by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, and Anthony Kennedy. Dissenting were Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Stephen Breyer, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
The Supreme Court ruling overturns its 1977 decision that said public-sector employees may be required to pay “fair-share fees,” also known as agency fees, if they decline to join a union.
The Janus ruling affects about 5 million government employees in 22 states who no longer will be required either to join a union or pay related fees as a condition of employment.
Mark Janus,  a child support specialist at the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services, was the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit.
“This case was one of the most important cases in decades for the freedom of speech and freedom of association,” Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner, a Republican, told The Daily Signal in a phone interview days before the decision. “This case is also about the battle against conflicts of interest and corruption.”
“Unions are making campaign contributions to elected officials, getting them into office and then they are negotiating their contracts with these same officials. In the private sector, you would go to jail for this kind of activity,” Rauner said.
The high court ruled that employees must affirmatively consent before a union may withhold fees from their paychecks, meaning the system must be “opt in,” not “opt out.” In addressing this point, Alito wrote:
Under Illinois law, if a public-sector collective bargaining agreement includes an agency-fee provision and the union certifies to the employer the amount of the fee, that amount is automatically deducted from the nonmember’s wages. No form of employee consent is required. This procedure violates the First Amendment and cannot continue.
Neither an agency fee nor any other payment to the union may be deducted from a nonmember’s wages, nor may any other attempt be made to collect such a payment, unless the employee affirmatively consents to pay. By agreeing to pay, nonmembers are waiving their First Amendment rights, and such a waiver cannot be presumed.
‘Hard Work Really Begins’
Roberta Lynch, executive director of the local AFSCME Council 31, condemned the ruling in a formal statement:
This case is a blatant political attack by Bruce Rauner and other wealthy interests on the freedom of working people to form strong unions. We are extremely disappointed the Supreme Court has taken the side of the powerful few, but we’re more determined than ever to keep our union strong, standing up for public services and the working people who provide them.
While pleased with the outcome, Matt Patterson, state field director for the California Policy Center, a nonprofit educational organization, says he doesn’t want advocates of worker freedom to become complacent while unions mobilize efforts to negate the ruling with the assistance of their allies in government.
“Now is when the real hard work really begins,” Patterson told The Daily Signal. “We need to hit the ground running so all of these workers can be educated and informed about their rights and what it means for them. Chief Justice John Roberts is not going to go door-to-door in Illinois and in other states telling government workers that they can now opt out from paying union fees.”
Patterson said the California Policy Center is poised to lead an effort to educate government employees in California about their rights.
The conflicts of interest between unions and government officials that Rauner and others identify provide union operatives with certain advantages that right-to-work advocates don’t have, Patterson said.
“Unions already have a group of dedicated, well-paid activists working tirelessly on their behalf,” he said, adding:
They’re called elected officials, and they will stop at nothing to advance the interests of organized labor at the expense of the taxpayer. To add insult to injury, they are funded by the taxpayer—in other words, you and me.
Public unions have operated like racketeering syndicates for decades—the Janus decision has the potential to bust that system up like some RICO statute from heaven.
RICO refers to a 1970 federal law, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Lawmakers initially passed it with an eye toward prosecuting Mafia figures, it is now applied more broadly against all organized crime.
AFSCME officials who had been named as defendants in the Janus case argued that government workers who decline to join a union should still be required to pay fair-share fees to support collective bargaining efforts.
These fees are used to help negotiate salaries and benefits for both union and nonunion workers, AFSCME lawyers explained in their brief to the high court.
In response to concerns about the free speech rights of government employees who are opposed to unions’ political activism, the lawyers for AFSCME told the court that the law already permits those employees to “opt out” from paying fees in support of political activities.

Unions as ‘Inherently Political’
 
The union argument did not carry the day at the Supreme Court because the lines between collective bargaining and political activism have become blurred in recent years, Vincent Vernuccio, a senior fellow with the Mackinac Center for Public Policy in Michigan, said in an interview.
“The court has finally come to see that everything public employee unions do is inherently political,” Vernuccio told The Daily Signal, adding:
We are not just talking about direct donations to candidates. When unions are negotiating for higher salaries and more benefits, those are taxpayer dollars we are talking about, and the decision to raise salaries and benefits at taxpayer expense is a policy choice that not everyone shares. At the heart of the Janus case is the idea that government unions are purely political.
Rebecca Friedrichs, an elementary school teacher who worked for 28 years in the Savanna School District in Anaheim, California, was the lead plaintiff in a case before the Supreme Court in 2016 that raised the same First Amendment argument against mandatory union fees.
But unlike Janus, the Friedrichs case explicitly asked the court to strike down “opt-out schemes” that government employees must navigate their way through to avoid subsidizing a union’s political activities.
Friedrichs submitted a friend-of-the-court brief in the Janus case, arguing in favor of a system that would enable workers to opt in rather than opt out of paying union fees.
The court “should make clear that government employers and unions must obtain workers’ affirmative consent before deducting any union dues or fees from their wages,” Friedrichs said in her brief. “This would prevent the use of ‘opt-out’ schemes, which many public-sector unions have used for years to undermine workers’ right to withhold funding for some union political causes.”
The high court ended up doing just this, ending the need for the other cases pressing for “opt in” arrangements.
Friedrichs had joined nine other teachers and the Christian Educators Association International to sue the California Teachers Association, several local unions, and the National Education Association.
But because Justice Antonin Scalia died about a month after oral arguments were held in the Friedrichs case on Jan. 11, 2016, the high court wound up deadlocking 4-4. That left a lower court ruling in place that upheld California’s “agency shop” law.

Eagle Scout Answers the Call
Just a few weeks after he was sworn in as governor of Illinois in January 2015, Rauner moved against union mandates in the public sector.
The Republican governor issued an executive order to prohibit collection of union fees from state government employees who are not union members. He also filed a federal lawsuit challenging collection of the fees as a violation of free speech.
Although a federal district judge ruled in 2016 that Rauner did not have standing since the governor was not part of a union and did not pay union dues or fees, the court permitted other state employees who weren’t union members to intervene and continue the litigation.
Janus, who earned the Eagle rank as a Boy Scout, answered the call. The child support specialist in the Illinois health care and family services agency became the lead plaintiff in the case that eventually reached the Supreme Court.
The Janus case challenged the constitutionality of state and local laws requiring government workers to pay fair-share fees to unions as a condition of employment.
The National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation joined with the Illinois-based Liberty Justice Center, a nonprofit public interest law firm, to represent Janus in the case. It named the American Federation of State County, County and Municipal Employees Council 31 in Illinois as the defendant.
AFSCME 31 “exclusively represents over 35,000 state employees who work in dozens of agencies, departments, boards, and commissions subject to the authority of Illinois’s governor,” according to court filings.
The Supreme Court’s ruling in favor of Janus overturns the 1977 decision in Abood v. Detroit Board of Education that said public-sector employees may be required to pay the fair-share fees if they decline to join a union.
In Abood, the justices had concluded that those who don’t join a union should not be permitted to operate as “free riders” who benefit from collective bargaining done on their behalf, and therefore should pay union fees. But the Abood ruling also said nonunion employees should not be forced to pay for political activism they do not support.
Lawyers representing Janus cited a series of recent decisions where the justices expressed rising skepticism toward the constitutionality of Abood while signaling willingness to issue a broad ruling in defense of First Amendment freedoms in the labor sector.
In his opinion for the majority, Alito wrote:
We recognize that the loss of payments from nonmembers may cause unions to experience unpleasant transition costs in the short term, and may require unions to make adjustments in order to attract and retain members.
But we must weigh these disadvantages against the considerable windfall that unions have received under Abood for the past 41 years. It is hard to estimate how many billions of dollars have been taken from nonmembers and transferred to public-sector unions in violation of the First Amendment. Those unconstitutional exactions cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely.
As for those 5 million government employees in 22 states who no longer will be required to join a union or pay related fees? Patterson, the California Policy Center field director, points to educational outreach efforts in Washington state as a model for what needs to be done at the local level across the country.
Many home-based health care workers, for example, were unaware that they no longer had to pay union dues as the result of another Supreme Court ruling, Harris v. Quinn. 
The Service Employees International Union, known as SEIU, teamed with government officials to prevent employees from exercising their rights until they were informed by an outreach organized through the Freedom Foundation, a nonprofit think tank, Patterson said.

“We really don’t know yet what the full impact of the Janus ruling will be,” Patterson told The Daily Signal. “If every public worker in American knows of their rights and how to exercise them, then this could be a cataclysm for public employee unions.”
“But of course, unions and their allies in the Democratic Party will do everything they can to block knowledge of these rights and the ability of workers to access these rights,” he said.
With union mandates outlawed in the public sector, attention now moves to a case out of Lincolnshire, Illinois, that is before the 7th U.S. Circuit Court Appeals. In it, union leaders challenge a local right-to-work ordinance prohibiting private-sector employers from entering into agreements that make union membership and payment of dues a condition of employment.
Rauner, a former private equity executive who is seeking re-election in November, said he supports the ordinance and anticipates that the case ultimately will work its way up to the Supreme Court.
“Why should one county or one city have their economic competitiveness determined by the decisions of another county or city?” the governor said. “If local officials wants free choice for their workers and not forced unionization, they should be able to make this choice.”

"Some 20,000 workers have left the Service Employees International Union in two states,  a shock to the labor organization that was riding high when some of its members staged this 2007 protest in Washington, D.C.  (Photo: Bill Clark/Roll Call/Newscom)
Union leaders in Washington state who plotted to undermine a U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturning mandatory union dues are now seeing the other end of that boot in the form of free speech activism and diminished membership.
“What a favorable Supreme Court ruling really means is that our work is just beginning,” @FreedomFdtn’s Brian Minnich says.
It’s illegal to force individuals who provide health care services in private homes to pay union dues.
But the powerful Service Employees International Union partnered with compliant government officials to prevent the caregivers from understanding their First Amendment rights, according to the Freedom Foundation, a nonprofit think tank headquartered in Olympia, Washington.
More than 20,000 union members opted to leave SEIU affiliates in Washington state and Oregon, however, after an aggressive outreach involving door-to-door canvassing, targeted mailings, phone calls, and television commercials.
The Freedom Foundation’s Brian Minnich told The Daily Signal that payroll data obtained from the state of Oregon indicate 11,399 out of 28,667 home care providers no longer paid dues to the SEIU affiliate there. That’s a drop of almost 40 percent.
In Washington state, payroll data from April, the latest available, show 9,100 former members of SEIU and the Washington Federation of State Employees no longer paid dues.
Beginning in November 2014, the Freedom Foundation hired and trained dozens of canvassers to educate home-based health care aides about their constitutional rights, as affirmed in that year’s Supreme Court ruling Harris v. Quinn, Minnich said in an interview with The Daily Signal.
The high court ruled that unions such as SEIU, which represent “quasi-public employees,” may collect dues only when they are offered voluntarily.
Since these workers are considered public employees only for the purposes of collective bargaining, government agencies and the courts do not view them as full-fledged public employees.
“We are an action tank, not just a think tank, and our strategy has been to inform SEIU members of their free speech rights and to let them know they have certain rights, including the right to not join a union and pay dues,” said Minnich, executive vice president of the Freedom Foundation, adding:
This effort has been very successful and remains ongoing. In the past year alone, we have cost the SEIU union [in Washington state] more than $10 million. We’ve been able to calculate this figure based on the number of people we know who have left the union, and what this has cost the union in terms of lost revenue from dues.
There is also the amount of money the union has spent on legal fees. Their legal fees have been huge because they are fighting us, and that’s money that they can’t spend on politics.
In 2016, policy analysts at the Freedom Foundation estimate, the SEIU in Washington state spent nearly $1 million on private law firms, an amount largely devoted to litigation against the foundation.
Since the only state payroll data the foundation has for Oregon is from May, they say, it is difficult to quantify how much SEIU 503, based in Salem, Oregon, has lost in union dues since the Supreme Court’s Harris v. Quinn ruling.
But Maxford Nelsen, the Freedom Foundation’s director of labor policy, offered an educated guess.
“My math shows that SEIU 503 lost about $400,000 in dues in May alone,” Nelsen said. “That means they’re on the path to losing about $4.8 million per year.”
No Comment From Union
The Daily Signal sought comment more than 10 days ago from the SEIU affiliates in Washington state and Oregon on their litigation and other disputes with the foundation. They had not responded by publication deadline.
The individual care providers who have left SEIU include home-based health care aides who receive Medicaid payments in exchange for services to needy and disabled individuals, who typically are family members. They also include child care providers paid by the state to serve low-income families
The Freedom Foundation initiated its outreach efforts in November 2014 with direct mail, email, and phone calls focused on the 7,000 child care providers who were members of Seattle-based SEIU 925 at the time. The following summer, the foundation sent out canvassers to meet individually with child care providers.
As of this past spring, almost two-thirds of family or child care providers no longer were paying dues to SEIU 925, according to the foundation.
Outreach efforts directed at 35,000 home care aides represented by Seattle-based SEIU 775 as of last year proved to be more difficult.
SEIU 775 fought in court and in the Washington state Legislature to prevent the Department of Social and Health Services from releasing a list of home care aides and contact information to the Freedom Foundation.
In April 2016, a state appeals court ruled against SEIU 775, saying the information had to be disclosed under the state’s Public Records Act.
The union also had lobbied state lawmakers to amend that law in 2015 and 2016 so that contact information for the individual care providers would be exempt from public records requests. This effort also failed.
Ties to Governor 
In early 2016, the Freedom Foundation began to receive contact lists from sources inside SEIU, making it possible to do the outreach. In September, the foundation received an official list of providers from Washington state officials after the state Supreme Court declined to hear the union’s appeal.
A separate but related educational campaign connected Freedom Foundation activists with about 1,000 workers who help the disabled and provide translation services for speakers of other languages. They were part of the Washington Federation of State Employees.
SEIU 775 continues to block and frustrate educational initiatives aimed at increasing understanding of free speech rights, Nelsen told The Daily Signal. The union received “special treatment” from government officials who benefit from its campaign contributions, he said.
A foundation study called the “Undue Influence Report” pulls together campaign finance data. It shows that Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, raked in almost $6 million from organized labor in his 2012 race for governor, compared with about $18,000 for his Republican opponent.
SEIU alone donated about $1.8 million to Inslee during the 2012 cycle.
“Union officials with the SEIU have implemented a comprehensive set of responses to Harris v. Quinn making it possible for them to skirt the law,” Nelsen said. “We have litigation challenging each of them, but it remains a tough fight given how well-connected the SEIU is with top government officials.”
SEIU 775 negotiated a collective bargaining agreement with the Inslee administration that calls for union dues to be withheld automatically unless an individual caregiver explicitly states that he or she doesn’t want dues to be deducted.
“This means every caregiver has union dues deducted from their paycheck regardless of whether or not they have signed up for the union,” Nelsen said. “We know from court filings that there are thousands of individuals who are having union dues deducted without their authorization, which we think is illegal.”
Millions in Illegal Dues
David Dewhirst, a litigation counsel with the Freedom Foundation, estimates that SEIU 775 collects $3.5 million in illegal dues each year. Each home caregiver pays about $585 per year to the union, he said, and about 6,000 caregivers did not give written authorization to the union to deduct dues.
The foundation lost in the Supreme Court of Washington, however, when it argued in May that automatic deduction of dues violates state law.
The organization has pursued a federal lawsuit against the Inslee administration and SEIU 775, seeking, in Nelsen’s words, “to end the various illegal and coercive means by which [individual care providers] are signed up for union membership.”
The Daily Signal sought comment from Inslee, but did not receive a reply from the governor’s press office by publication deadline.
In response to the Harris ruling by the nation’s highest court, SEIU changed the fine print on its membership form. Now, those who sign the form can’t cancel membership dues unless they submit a written statement during a 15-day annual window from 30 to 45 days before the anniversary of the date they first signed.

Until recently, caregivers were required to attend union presentations delivered as part of their orientation process, administered through the Washington state Department of Social and Health Services.
Department officials were not permitted in the room while union officials delivered their pitch to incoming caregivers.
“We did file litigation that forced the SEIU and the state government to make the union portion of the orientation process voluntary,” Nelsen said. “This was a recent win, but we are still trying to address the fact that caregivers are not told that the union portion of their orientation is voluntary.”
Meanwhile, SEIU operatives fell back on what Nelsen describes as a “last-ditch effort” to prevent the Freedom Foundation from getting the names and contact information of caregivers—in the form of Initiative 1501, which won voter approval in November.
Unions advertised the initiative as a measure that would protect against identity theft, he said, but the real objective was to prevent the foundation from communicating with caregivers about their rights.
‘Playing Games’
The Freedom Foundation filed suit in federal court, challenging the constitutionality of Initiative 1501 under the U.S. Constitution’s First and 14th Amendments.
The measure violates caregivers’ First Amendment right of free association and the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment, foundation lawyers argue, because unions can get ahold of personal contact information for caregivers while denying it to others.
The Freedom Foundation, which marks its 26th anniversary this year, also has offices in Oregon and California, where it is expanding outreach efforts. Nelsen and other labor policy analysts also are eyeing legal developments in other states.
Minnesota, for instance, stands out as a particularly important test case. In that state, home caregivers accuse the local SEIU of forging signatures on union membership cards and committing voter fraud in a union election conducted by mail-in ballot.
New cases challenging mandatory union dues continue to work their way up to the Supreme Court.
Minnich, the foundation’s executive vice president, cautions against the idea that favorable Supreme Court rulings will resolve the problem of labor practices that suppress free speech without committed activism.
“There is a certain amount of thinking out there that says favorable Supreme Court rulings will solve this problem,” Minnich said. “But in fact, when you look at our state [Washington] and Oregon and California and Minnesota, the lesson here is that state government officials and unions will continue to play games.”
He added:
People are not going to know they have rights unless somebody is there to tell them that they don’t have to join a union and pay dues. Certainly, the union is not going to tell them that. What a favorable Supreme Court ruling really means is that our work is just beginning.

"""Those states, like Illinois, that don’t have right-to-work [laws] generally have bad economic policies, and they find it hard to stimulate growth in their communities,"" says lawyer Jacob Huebert, left, of the Liberty Justice Center.

If a federal court strikes down a local right-to-work ordinance in Illinois, the case could move up to the Supreme Court, according to legal analysts who have argued in favor of similar initiatives in other parts of the country.
That’s because a negative ruling from a three-judge panel of the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which heard oral arguments March 27 in the Illinois case, would conflict with a 2016 ruling out of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that upheld local right-to-work initiatives in Kentucky, they said.
“When you have a split between circuits, holding different interpretations regarding the law and precedent, then the Supreme Court is more likely to … hear the case,” Theodore Kittila, a Delaware lawyer who represents the Caesar Rodney Institute, a Wilmington-based free-market think tank, said in an email.
“It’s not automatic, and circuit splits can last for years and years,” Kittila said. “But this is such an important issue, it may be enough to attract the Supreme Court’s interest, even without a circuit split.”
Right-to-work laws prohibit private-sector employers from entering into agreements that make union membership and payment of union dues a condition of employment for their workers.
Twenty-eight states and the territory of Guam ban forced unionization. Kentucky, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, and West Virginia have become right-to-work states since 2012.
The Illinois-based Liberty Justice Center, a nonprofit public-interest law firm, is defending the right-to-work ordinance in the village of Lincolnshire, Illinois, against a legal challenge from labor unions.
While no legal injunction has been imposed, Lincolnshire officials decided not to enforce the right-to-work law pending the outcome of the litigation.
Where the Action Is
Illinois is now at the epicenter of the right-to-work battle in both the private and public sectors.
The Liberty Justice Center joined with the National Right to Work Foundation to represent Mark Janus, a child-support specialist employed by the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services. Janus is the lead plaintiff in a case before the Supreme Court that challenges the constitutionality of state and local laws requiring government workers to pay “fair share” fees to unions as a condition of employment.
Such fees are the payments that nonunion workers are required to pay to cover the costs of collective bargaining agreements between employers and employees. The Janus plaintiffs argue that union priorities are laced with political activism they don’t support and should not be forced to pay for as a condition of employment.
Although the Supreme Court previously turned away a legal challenge to the 6th Circuit ruling in favor of right to work, a lawyer with the Liberty Justice Center said he suspects the high court would step in if the 7th Circuit rules against Lincolnshire.
“If there were a circuit split, then this would be an appropriate issue for the Supreme Court to take up,” Jacob Huebert, director of litigation for the legal group, told The Daily Signal in an interview, adding:
We certainly hope the Supreme Court would take the case up, because it’s an important issue and right to work creates opportunities for communities. Those states, like Illinois, that don’t have right-to-work [laws] generally have bad economic policies, and they find it hard to stimulate growth in their communities.
While the right-to-work ordinance remains on hold in Lincolnshire, both Sandoval County, New Mexico, and the city of Seaford, Delaware, enacted new laws earlier this year that are now in effect.
Kentucky’s local right-to-work laws also remain on the books, but are superseded by the state law that made Kentucky a right-to-work state in 2017.

Local officials in other parts of New Mexico, Delaware, and Pennsylvania are eyeing their own versions of local right-to-work laws, The Daily Signal has learned.
What Labor Law Says
Lincolnshire’s arguments in favor of its local ordinance closely resemble those of Hardin County, Kentucky, which prevailed in a unanimous ruling out of the 6th Circuit, Huebert said.
“We argue that the National Labor Relations Act has never pre-empted the field of right-to-work laws at all,”  Huebert said. “The very first time the Supreme Court considered that question, it said there was no pre-emption. Congress didn’t intend to pre-empt the field, and there’s no basis for concluding that it did.”
“All of the legislative history in the National Labor Relations Act says that Congress intended to stay out of the question of right-to-work laws and leave questions about whether we should have right-to-work [laws] to the states,” he added.
The National Labor Relations Act of 1935, also known as the Wagner Act, specifies that states and territories may enact right-to-work laws.
However, the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 399 AFL-CIO argues in its legal brief in the Lincolnshire case that the 1947 Taft-Hartley amendments to the law prevent localities from adopting right-to-work ordinances.
The union brief asserts:
Local right-to-work ordinances are not ‘state’ laws under § 14(b), and are, therefore, pre-empted by the NLRA. Such ordinances, adopted pursuant to a general grant of home-rule authority, do not constitute a state policy choice. The enactment of local right-to-work ordinances would interfere with state policy in those states that permit free collective bargaining over union security.
In a phone interview Friday with The Daily Signal, William A. Widmer III, counsel to the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 399, said that section of federal labor law excludes municipalities and other political subdivisions from enacting their own right-to-work laws.
“During oral arguments, Judge Diane Wood clearly understood that when Congress passed the National Labor Relations Act, it was the intent of Congress to establish a national labor law with the right-to-work option limited to states,” Widmer said. “If the law permitted local governments to pass local right-to-work ordinances, you would have multiple, perhaps thousands of, different laws affecting collective bargaining.”
As for the potential for a split between federal appeals courts on the issue, Widmer said:
I think the 6th Circuit got it wrong, and I think the 7th Circuit will get it right. When you have a split in the circuits, that is typically when the Supreme Court grants a writ of certiorari [and reviews a case]. But there is a strong argument to made that the subsequent action in Kentucky making Kentucky a right-to-work state means that the 6th Circuit ruling is now moot.
>>> Related: Right-to-Work Advocate Blames Unions’ Legal Threats for Loss
The arguments for and against the local right-to-work ordinance in Lincolnshire turn on the authority states give to localities under home rule statutes. That also was the case in Sussex County, Delaware, which voted down a right-to-work bill earlier this year, and in the Kentucky counties that embraced right-to-work laws.
Huebert said the law and the case history work to Lincolnshire’s advantage.
Seventh Circuit Chief Judge Diane Wood, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton, “asked challenging questions of both sides,” Huebert said in an email to The Daily Signal.
Judge William Bauer, appointed by President Gerald Ford, and Judge Michael Kanne, appointed by President Ronald Reagan, did not ask questions.
At the Heart of the Case
“We are optimistic that we’ll prevail, because the law is on our side,” Huebert said, adding:
Home rule is indeed at the heart of the case. The Illinois Constitution gives home-rule municipalities, such as the village of Lincolnshire, broad authority to enact laws that they believe will benefit their local jurisdictions. And the unions don’t even dispute that Lincolnshire’s home-rule powers under state law include the authority to enact a local right-to-work ordinance.
The unions say federal law only allows ‘state’  right-to-work laws, not local right-to-work laws, but states have the right to decide for themselves whether to exercise their power through their central governments or through local governments.
Under Supreme Court precedent, if Congress wants to interfere with states’ internal arrangements for exercising their power, it must make a clear statement that it’s doing so. Congress didn’t do that in the National Labor Relations Act, so Illinois retained its authority to delegate its power to enact right-to-work laws to local governments.
Brent Yessin, a labor lawyer who has advised counties considering right-to-work measures in Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and New Mexico, said he sees a potential for the Supreme Court to eventually enter the fray as localities pass more ordinances.
The counties in those states where he has served as an adviser, and in others, such as Ohio and Maryland, “clearly have the power to pass ordinances,” Yessin said in an email to The Daily Signal. “The overwhelming authority at the Supreme Court and circuit court level is that states can delegate their authority to regulate forced union dues, and the only issue is whether they have done so.”
Although he said he isn’t familiar with the situation in Illinois, Yessin said he is encouraged by legal developments in New Mexico. In January, the Sandoval County Commission passed a right-to-work bill in a 3-1 vote with one abstention.
Just a few weeks later, the New Mexico Federation of Labor filed suit. The union released a statement detailing some main arguments in the lawsuit, which identifies the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 611 and United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1564 as the two organizations most affected.
In analyzing the unions’ arguments, Yessin said, he finds that they made a critical concession.
“In New Mexico, two unions concede that the state can delegate their power to prevent forced dues and are pinning their hopes on a finding [that] the state hasn’t actually done so,” he said. “But that legal retreat signals a win for cities and counties that want to create jobs even when their legislators can’t muster the courage to do so.”
Jay Block, a Sandoval County commissioner and early supporter of right-to-work laws in New Mexico, told The Daily Signal that Otero County and McKinley County are considering their own ordinances. Legislation could be introduced within a few weeks, he said.
“We are asking elected officials across the state to stand up to forced unionism and to stand up for the full potential of this state to be an economic powerhouse,” Block said. “We are going one county at a time.”
On the opposite side of the country, the new right-to-work law in Seaford, Delaware, has not been challenged in court.
“We are a small town without a lawsuit, which is a great thing,” Mayor David Genshaw said in an email. “Right now, we are working on spreading the word, because we are finding there are many people in our own state who don’t know about the law.”

"“In my opinion, the union is 100 percent political,"" says California teacher Ryan Yohn, lead plaintiff in a federal  case, pictured here Feb. 26 outside the Supreme Court.
 (Photo: Kevin Mooney/The Daily Signal)
Government workers who don’t want to join unions should be able to “opt in” rather than “opt out” of union fees that finance political activism, some California teachers argue.
“Unions don’t want people to know how to opt out; they harass you and bully you once you do try,” @4kidsandcountry says.
Unless the nation’s highest court prohibits public employee unions from deducting dues and other fees from paychecks without consent, those workers will be forced to help pay for causes they don’t support, according to the teachers, who have filed a federal lawsuit in Los Angeles.
Two teachers who are plaintiffs in Yohn v. California Teachers Association described to The Daily Signal how union “opt-out schemes” may be used to dilute any new ruling from the Supreme Court in favor of state government workers who have challenged mandatory union fees under the First Amendment.
The teachers argue for the “opt in” approach both in their own case and in a friend-of-the-court brief filed on behalf of Illinois state workers in Janus v. AFSCME, a case now before the Supreme Court.
“The Janus case is making the same free speech argument that my case is,” Ryan Yohn, the lead plaintiff in the case, said in an interview on the steps of the Supreme Court. “But we have a second argument, and that is that we as teachers should be permitted to opt in rather than opting out from paying fees that go to support political activism we do not agree with.”
“In my opinion,” Yohn added, “the union is 100 percent political because you really cannot separate the overt political activism from the collective bargaining, which involves public policy questions.”
The Daily Signal interviewed Yohn as he and others rallied Feb. 26 outside the Supreme Court on the morning  the justices heard oral arguments in Janus v. AFSCME.
Yohn, a middle school teacher for 13 years for the Westminster School District in Southern California,  joined dozens of others who traveled from across the country to express support for Mark Janus, the lead plaintiff in that case. Janus is a child support specialist with the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services.
“Everything my union negotiates over is political,” Yohn said. “But so long as the union has my money, they don’t have to listen to me. The opt-out arrangement is set up perfectly for them because it means they already have our money to spend on politics.”
“But if we only had to decide just one time if we wanted to opt in and pay these fees,” he said, “then the union would have to listen to our concerns instead of just automatically having our money.”
Fees to Prevent ‘Free Riders’
The Janus case challenges the constitutionality of state and local laws requiring government workers to pay “fair share” fees to unions as a condition of employment.
Lawyers for Janus and two other Illinois state employees who joined the case are asking the Supreme Court to overturn its 1977 ruling in Abood v. Detroit Board of Education that said public sector workers may be required to pay the fair-share fees, also known as agency fees, if they decline to join a union.
In the Abood case, the justices concluded that those who don’t join a union should not be permitted to operate as “free riders” who benefit from collective bargaining on their behalf, and thus should pay fair-share fees. But the ruling also said nonunion workers should not be forced to pay for political activism they don’t support.
>>> Related: Mandatory Union Fees Divide Demonstrators as Supreme Court Hears Arguments
Yohn’s case on behalf of teachers is modeled after Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, which made it to the Supreme Court. Because Justice Antonin Scalia unexpectedly died about a month after oral arguments on Jan. 11, 2016, however, the high court wound up deadlocking 4-4.
That left a lower court ruling in place that upheld California’s “agency shop” law requiring nonunion workers to pay fair-share fees as a condition of employment.
Since the Janus case now before the high court doesn’t address the question of an opt-in arrangement versus an opt-out one, the legal challenge from Yohn and other California teachers could assume a heightened importance, Terry Pell, president of the Center for Individual Rights, told The Daily Signal in a phone interview.
If the Supreme Court issues a narrow ruling in Janus that strikes down mandatory union fees without addressing the opt-in/opt-out question, Pell said, public employees such as Yohn could be forced to navigate through lengthy opt-out requests to get refunds for annual fees because of the way contracts are structured.
“If that happens, the Yohn case becomes very important and we will get it to the Supreme Court as fast as we can,” Pell said, noting that his group’s friend-of the-court brief in Janus asks for a broad opinion that addresses the opt-out issue.
The Center for Individual Rights is a nonprofit, public interest firm based in Washington that represents the Yohn plaintiffs and also represented the Friedrichs plaintiffs.
If the Supreme Court rules in favor of Janus and his fellow plaintiffs but leaves opt-out provisions in place, unions could argue that existing contracts require nonunion members to file paperwork seeking refunds for 100 percent of the annual fees rather than just a portion, Pell said.

Teachers Unions ‘Spend Too Much Time on Politics’
Bruce Aster has been a history and government teacher for 30 years at Carlsbad High School in Carlsbad, California, but has declined to become a member of the California Teachers Association.
While he supports his local teachers union, Aster told The Daily Signal, the state and national unions “spend too much time on politics” at the expense of public school employees and their legitimate workplace concerns at the local level.
Aster said in a phone interview that he favors an opt-in arrangement because he “feels strongly” that mandatory union fees violate the free speech of teachers who don’t support the political agenda of unions:
My great hope is that a lot of folks who want to stay involved with their local union would be able to do this without getting involved with the state and national political scene. We all want to stay involved with the nuts and bolts of contract issues that matter to all of us regardless of political affiliation. The big problem we have is with the statewide affiliation, not with the local union, which is less of an overt political organization.
The Daily Signal sought comment from the California Teachers Association, which had no responded at publication time.
Before becoming a California teacher, Aster was a legislative assistant on education issues in the U.S. House of Representatives during the 1980s. He says he encountered union lobbyists on Capitol Hill who “were more interested in a political agenda than they were in true education issues.”
Each year, Aster said, he sends a letter to colleagues at his school advising them of their option to become a nonunion fee payer. His total union fees this year are $1,096; last year, they amounted to $1,059.
His rebates on the political portion of the fees in the past 10 years ranged from $317 to $469, Aster said.
Leaving the union is a “big hurdle” for many colleagues since it means they lose out on certain benefits, he told The Daily Signal.
“The union holds out the liability insurance as a big carrot to keep people in the union,” he said. “If you resign, you also lose the right to vote in union elections, and there are other benefits you have to give up.”
The Yohn case, currently before the federal district court in Los Angeles, has been stayed pending the outcome of the Janus case at the Supreme Court.

Opt-Out System ‘Difficult, Arduous’
Rebecca Friedrichs, who worked for 28 years as an elementary school teacher in the Savanna School District in Anaheim, California, was the lead plaintiff in the Friedrichs case that went to the Supreme Court in 2016.
Friedrichs joined nine other teachers and the Christian Educators Association International to sue the California Teachers Association, several local unions, and the National Education Association.
Since Friedrichs supports school choice, lower taxes, and traditional marriage, she is typically on the opposite side of public policy questions from union leadership. She filed her own friend-of-the-court brief in the Janus case, arguing in favor of an opt-in system for union fees.
“The first problem with the opt-out is the unions make it almost impossible to figure out how to opt out,” Friedrichs told The Daily Signal in a phone interview. “If you meet your average teacher on the street and ask them how to opt out, they would have no idea. The unions don’t want people to know how to opt out, and they harass you and bully you once you do try to opt out.”
>>> Related: Where Does Your State Stand on the Right to Work? This Project Maps Out Answers
While those who don’t belong to the union technically are permitted to get a rebate for the political portion of union fees, the process is “very difficult and very arduous,” Friedrichs said.
“The second problem with opting out is inertia,” she said, adding:
When you have to opt out, this means everyone is in until individual teachers figure out how to jump through all these hoops. This is not the way it should be. I think the unions should have to make an effort to earn my business.
They shouldn’t automatically get my business and then make it difficult for me to get out. Instead, it should be the opposite approach. The union is a tax-free, private organization. As teachers we should be able to decide whether or not we want to opt in. If the unions have a valuable service to offer, let them make their case.
Free Speech Front and Center
Friedrichs said she hopes for a broad ruling in the Janus case.
In her court filing, the veteran California teacher says her personal experiences demonstrate that “unions will bully, harass, and isolate workers to prevent them from taking affirmative action to stop subsidizing union political speech.” So, she argues, the Supreme Court should require government employers and unions to acquire the explicit consent of public employees before deducting union dues and fees from their paychecks.
Union members and leaders who spoke with The Daily Signal outside the Supreme Court on the day of oral arguments in Janus said they oppose “free riders,” who they said shouldn’t be permitted to benefit from collective bargaining negotiations without paying union fees.
Elizabeth Slattery, a legal fellow with The Heritage Foundation, sees current laws mandating union fees as an assault on the First Amendment.
“The Supreme Court’s rationale in the 1977 Abood case was that the government has compelling interests in dealing with an exclusive representative for its employees and in preventing labor unrest,” Slattery said in an email to The Daily Signal. “But a majority of the court has grown increasingly skeptical of whether these interests are important enough to override the First Amendment rights of the public employees.”
Slattery, who attended the oral arguments in the Janus case, said several exchanges between the opposing sides stood out.
In one, she said, a lawyer from the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees suggested that if the justices rule against the unions, they should expect labor unrest throughout the country.
But in a rebuttal, Bill Messenger, a lawyer with the National Right to Work Foundation, pointed out that the idea that agency fees are the price employees must pay to prevent unions from striking is radical. It’s similar to how the mob operates in demanding protection money, Messenger said.
“It’s certainly not an interest the court should accept as a reason to infringe the First Amendment rights of public employees,” Slattery said.
If the Supreme Court finds mandatory agency fees are unconstitutional, that should resolve the opt-in, opt-out problem, she said, because “by joining the union, you opt in.”

"Union members dominate those watching the Sussex County Council hold a hearing on the right-to-work measure Jan. 2 from an overflow room in the county's administrative building. (Photo: Kevin Mooney/The Daily Signal)
GEORGETOWN, Delaware—Officials in one of Delaware’s three counties rejected right-to-work legislation Tuesday, shortly after the county attorney detailed his legal opinion and predicted a thicket of costly court challenges to the law from labor unions.
Sussex County Council member Rob Arlett, who has spearheaded the proposal, told The Daily Signal that the council backed down in the face of those legal threats from unions.
“Today, the Sussex County Council made a decision based on fear of litigation,” Arlett said in a phone interview after digesting the 4-1 defeat of his bill. “I’m encouraged by the outpouring of support from the business community. I’m disappointed the council decided to uphold the status quo.”
Arlett was the only one of the council members, all Republicans, to vote yes on the right-to-work measure.
Right-to-work laws prohibit private sector employers from entering into agreements that make union membership and payment of union dues a condition of employment.
A total of 28 states and the territory of Guam now have right-to-work laws, with Kentucky, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, and West Virginia making the move since 2012.
Delaware last month became the only state in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic with a local right-to-work law on the books. The city council of Seaford, not content to wait on the Sussex County Council to act, passed its own ordinance Dec. 12.
Sussex County officials had put off action Tuesday after dozens of union members turned out in force at government offices to oppose the legislation during a public hearing. The Sussex council then asked for a formal opinion from the county attorney, J. Everett Moore, pending this week’s 4-1 vote.
The International Brotherhood of Electricians was among unions celebrating the defeat of the bill on social media:

— IBEW (@IBEW) January 9, 2018

“What we want regardless of the color of our shirts is we all want jobs, and we all want the best for our families,” Arlett said before casting his lone vote in favor of the ordinance.
“We have to do something as a community and as a council to attract new industries, I think all sides agree to that,” he said. “The question before us today is, is this a tool in that toolbox as a community that we should consider?”
Arlett, a business owner, headed President Donald Trump’s campaign in Delaware.
Representatives of local union affiliates gathered before last week’s hearing at a traffic circle outside the Sussex County Administrative Office Building. Members also packed the council chambers and watched the action from overflow rooms.
“My No. 1 concern is that right to work lowers wages,” Kat Caudle, a member of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, told The Daily Signal before the hearing.
“Workers should have the right to bargain for wages,” Caudle said, “and unions bring equality to this process.”
‘People Want This’
Voting no Tuesday were council President Michael Vincent, Vice President George Cole, and Councilmen Samuel Wilson and Irwin Burton.
Arlett at first moved to delay action but the other council members also rejected that.
Based on testimony and the public record, Arlett said, it is evident to him that “people want this.” He also recognized that “quite a few others [are] in opposition.”
>>> Delaware County Stalls Right-to-Work Vote as Unions Protest
“I believe in the power of choice and to me, if it’s worthy for six school districts in this county, why isn’t it worthy in the private sector?”
Six of the eight school districts in Sussex County are right-to-work entities in the public sector, with no requirement for teachers to pay fees to the union.
“That’s just a commonsense analogy,” Arlett said.
He also acknowledged differing legal opinions. 
“That’s why there is a court system, to determine what is lawful and not lawful,” Arlett said. “On the merits of economic development … if it has the ability to attract jobs, then we should consider it and let the courts make their decision as they see fit. So, for that reason alone, based on the testimony and the record, I will vote in favor of this.”

‘Unlikely’ Success
But the testimony and opinion of Moore, the council’s attorney, carried the day. 
Moore repeated his concern that Delaware’s home rule statute did not delegate authority to the council to adopt a right-to-work law. Sussex County would be drawn into legal challenges at both the state and federal level that could prove costly,  he said. 
“My opinion is that a Delaware court is unlikely to uphold the ordinance in its current form,” Moore said. 
The county attorney also warned council members that if they did go forward with the ordinance and accept pro-bono legal coverage from outside the state, they would need to confer with the State Public Integrity Commission, whose rules cover payment to government employees.
Burton also spoke at length, saying he voted no because he was convinced by Moore that the county would incur legal costs that would detract from the council’s ability to perform its primary functions. 
“If we adopt this ordinance, we will be in expensive, time-consuming litigation,” the council member said. 
Burton credited Moore with providing a “thorough, extensive opinion.” 
Given the need to attract new jobs, Burton said, his vote was “one of the hardest decisions” of his career. 
Burton expressed concern that enforcement of a controversial ordinance would burden the county with additional costs. 
“I’m a proponent of limited government and of keeping costs low,” Burton said. “This will cause an expansion of government and new costs.”
Legal Landscape
Vincent, the council president, said he shared Burton’s concerns about the legalities and also said the council could have handled the matter better procedurally. Despite what some critics charged, Vincent said, there was “no stonewalling” by the council.
Despite voting no,  Cole said he favored the concept of right to work but was not convinced the council had the legislative authority to move forward. 
“I wish there was a way I could vote yes,” Cole told fellow council members.
>>> Town OKs Right-to-Work Law in Advance of County Action
At least two lawyers in Delaware have disagreed publicly with Moore’s opinion that the state’s home rule statute doesn’t allow local right-to-work laws.
Theodore Kittila, a lawyer speaking for the Caesar Rodney Institute, a free-market think tank based in Wilmington, told council members last Tuesday that Sussex County has the authority to pass such a law under authority delegated by the 1970 statute. Kittila expanded on this point, citing several cases, in a written legal opinion that is part of the public record.
Kevin Fasic, a Wilmington-based lawyer who specializes in construction law, said during the council’s Oct. 24 meeting that a 6th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling opened the door for local right-to-work laws in Delaware and other parts of the country.
As The Daily Signal has previously reported, the U.S. Supreme Court turned away a legal challenge to the local right-to-work ordinance in Hardin County, Kentucky, permitting the 6th Circuit ruling to stand.
The 6th Circuit covers Kentucky, Michigan, Tennessee, and Ohio; Delaware falls within the 3rd Circuit, which has not ruled on the merits of local right-to-work laws.
If the 3rd Circuit were to rule in conflict with the 6th Circuit, the case likely would move up to the U.S. Supreme Court. But Fasic noted during the October meeting that the high court may have signaled its intention to uphold local right-to-work laws last year when it rejected a petition from labor unions challenging the Kentucky law.
But on Tuesday, Moore insisted the legal questions are not entirely the same.
“Because some other county has done this, doesn’t mean that we can,” Moore said. “We have to look at the underlying legislation.”
While the ruling out of the 6th Circuit “may influence” the 3rd Circuit, it doesn’t “control” either the 3rd Circuit or the U.S. Supreme Court, Moore told council members.
‘Just the Beginning’
“Today, the Sussex County Council made a decision based on fear of litigation … unlike the city of Seaford, which made a decision based on principle and what is in the best interest of families,” Arlett told The Daily Signal later Tuesday in a phone interview more than two hours later, adding:
I don’t regret the decision to introduce the ordinance, because if I hadn’t I’m certain the city of Seaford would not have moved forward with their own ordinance. This fight will continue.
We now have a public record and public testimony and we have people on record. I’m encouraged by the outpouring of support from the business community. I’m disappointed the council decided to uphold the status quo. This shows how difficult change can be. But this is just the beginning.
In New Mexico, Sandoval County has pursued its own right-to-work legislation amid intense union opposition. The County Commission is set to vote Jan. 14 on the bill.
Although union leaders also threaten to file lawsuits to block the Sandoval County measure, Forbes columnist Matt Patterson has noted that unions “almost always lose” such challenges.
Ken McIntyre contributed to this report, which has been updated to include Arlett’s later remarks.

"Kentucky is poised to become the 27th right-to-work state. (Photo: Ryan Garza/TNS/Newscom)
Kentucky’s Gov. Matt Bevin, a Republican, has now officially signed right-to-work legislation–along with other jobs legislation–into law.
Yet the impact of Kentucky’s right-to-work legislation could move beyond the state’s borders.
Right-to-work laws prohibit employers from entering into agreements that make union membership and the payment of union dues a condition of employment.
Additionally, Bevin signed the Paycheck Protection Act, which calls on workers to “opt in” if they want union dues withheld from their paychecks instead of requiring workers to “opt out” if they don’t want their union dues withheld.
The other big-ticket item eliminates the “prevailing wage” employers must now pay on work funded with public money. This involves construction work on schools and government buildings.
These laws could have a significant impact on the national debate over worker freedom. Kentucky is poised to become the 27th right-to-work state.
A Republican Wave
“Promises made, Promises kept.”
That’s how Kentucky state Rep. Jason Nemes, R-Louisville, describes the successful push for right-to-work legislation that went down during Saturday’s special session of his state’s General Assembly.
Nemes was elected in November along with a Republican wave that delivered the Kentucky House of Representatives to his party for the first time since 1921.
“I’m calling it promises made, promises kept because we ran on worker freedom, we ran on right-to-work, and we ran on paycheck protection and on repealing the prevailing wage law. We delivered in just the first week of the new General Assembly,” Nemes told The Daily Signal in a phone interview.
“These votes for right-to-work were about economic development and about making our state more competitive,” Nemes said. “But it isn’t just about economic development. Right-to-work is also about liberty and freedom of association. Someone shouldn’t be forced to join an organization just to put food on the table.”
Kentucky labor unions, which held loud and boisterous protests in and around the statehouse in Frankfort, Kentucky, throughout the week and into Saturday, remain ardently opposed to the legislation the governor is set to sign into law.
UAW Local 2164, United Food and Commercial Workers Local 227, and the Kentucky State AFL-CIO are among the unions that expressed strong opposition to the right-to-work bill and other labor-related bills that passed Saturday.
“They don’t want to work for the working man and it’s sad but true but they want to fight unions every way they can fight us,” Monica Williams, president of UAW Local 2164, told The Daily Signal. “Unions are good for all people, not just for unions.”
That’s unfortunate, Williams added, because unions deliver social and economic benefits that Republican critics overlook.
From Local to National Debate
What happened in Kentucky is not necessarily going to stay in Kentucky. That’s because the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers districts in Kentucky, Michigan, Tennessee, and Ohio,  issued a ruling in November that upheld the right of localities to pass right-to-work ordinances in the absence of state-level legislation.
The action began in Warren County, Kentucky, in the fall of 2014 with 11 other counties following suit.
The Kentucky counties argued that because the federal government has already authorized states to pass right-to-work laws, it follows that the counties are also permitted to pass right to work since they are creations of the state. Therefore, the counties argued, local right-to-work ordinances are permissible unless a state legislative body explicitly forbids them.
Jim Waters, president of the Bluegrass Institute, a libertarian, free-market think tank in Kentucky, said in a phone interview with The Daily Signal that Warren County’s decision to press ahead with its own ordinance certainly had an impact on what happened statewide.
“What this means is that we will no longer watch jobs and opportunities fly over or go around our state,” he said.
Waters pointed out that Kentucky’s largest border is with Tennessee, which is a right-to-work state, and four of Kentucky’s seven neighboring states are right to work: Indiana, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia.
“$1 billion in capital investment has gone into Warren County since it passed right to work in December 2014. Yes, that’s B as in billion,” Waters said. “These are not prospects; these are commitments. When legislators in other parts of the state saw what was happening in Warren County, they certainly took notice. I’m not saying it was the factor in determining what happened statewide, but it was certainly a factor.”
Waters also said that there are 55,000 new job openings in a 50-mile radius of where Warren County passed its right-to-work ordinance.
“That’s not a coincidence,” he said.
“I do believe our county government initiative advanced the Kentucky legislative effort, as it created a public awareness, and helped to educate citizens about right to work throughout the state,” Mike Buchanon, the Warren County judge-executive, said in an email. “The entire state was amazed at the remarkable increase in new prospects that contacted Warren County immediately after we passed right to work.”
Buchanon added:
Kentucky is a great place for business. But the fact that we were the only state in the southeast U.S. that was not right to work kept us from being considered for a site for new locations by growing industries. Site selectors have told us that as many as 75 percent of their clients instructed them to eliminate any state that wasn’t right to work. That left Kentucky off the list of consideration, right from the beginning.
But now that right to work has passed, Buchanon said, the state Legislature can “post a sign over the commonwealth’s front door” that says “Kentucky is open for business.”
Kentucky’s Example Could Inspire Localities to Act
Kentucky’s local clashes over right-to-work laws may now have an impact beyond even the state level.
The drive for local right-to-work laws experienced a temporary setback in February when a federal district court ruled against a right-to-work ordinance in Hardin County, Kentucky. But the 6th Circuit ruling reversed that lower court ruling.
Nemes, the Kentucky state representative, sees the 6th Circuit ruling giving impetus to localities outside of Kentucky.
“One difficulty we had with the local ordinances is that it was a novel approach and people were cautious because they knew the unions were going to sue,” he said. “But the 6th Circuit ruling in very powerful language upholding these local ordinances, will give courage to other localities to pass their own right-to-work ordinances.”
Before being elected to the Kentucky House, Nemes served as an attorney coordinating the legal defense for the counties passing their own ordinances. He anticipates that Ohio counties will now be motivated to take up right to work. With the exception of Pennsylvania, Ohio is now surrounded by right-to-work states following the passage of the law in Kentucky.
James Sherk, a labor policy analyst with The Heritage Foundation, sees a potential for legal disputes over local right to work to move up to the U.S. Supreme Court, depending on how the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals rules in a case out of Lincolnshire, Illinois, where a federal district judge ruled against a local right-to-work ordinance.
“If all the federal appeals courts rule the same way, the U.S. Supreme Court typically does not step in,” Sherk said. “But if the 7th Circuit were to rule against the local right to work, then you would have a conflict between the two circuits and typically the Supreme Court steps in to create consistency in the law when you have two circuits reading it differently. The litigation out of Illinois could go up to the Supreme Court potentially.”
Spreading to Other States
Now that Bevin has put his signature to the Kentucky bills, the primary legislative battleground over right-to-work laws will have already shifted over to Missouri, where that state’s House of Representatives is set to hold hearings Tuesday on its own legislation. The Missouri Senate is expected to follow up with hearings on its own version of the right-to-work bill later this week.
Eric Greitens, Missouri’s newly-elected Republican governor, campaigned for right-to-work laws and it is widely expected that he will sign off on any new legislation that reaches his desk. Missouri fell just short of passing right to work in September 2015 when Republican lawmakers could not produce enough support to override then-Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon’s veto.
Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, and Matt Patterson, executive director of the Center for Worker Freedom, have come out in support of a Missouri right-to-work law. The Center for Worker Freedom is a special project of Americans for Tax Reform, a nonprofit taxpayer advocacy group based in the District of Columbia.
Norquist and Patterson signed a letter last week addressed to the Missouri General Assembly urging lawmakers to vote in favor of “right to work.”
“The towns and communities in Ohio that border right-to-work states are going to start feeling the pressure just as they did in Kentucky,” Patterson, the Center for Worker Freedom executive director, told The Daily Signal. “We are also going to see Missouri start to move very quickly on right to work with the hearings that come this week.”
Norquist and Patterson highlight key statistics in their letter as they make the case for ending forced unionization. They wrote:
Right-to-work states have seen an average of 68 percent greater job growth than the average of forced-unionization states, according to government labor statistics. In 2012, Indiana has seen its unemployment cut nearly in half since it passed its right-to-work law in 2012, from 9.1 percent in 2011 to 5.4 percent today. Currently, six of the eight states bordering Missouri are right to work, putting the Show Me State at a tremendous disadvantage. In order to boost its competitiveness and give Missouri businesses every advantage to grow and create jobs, lawmakers must do their part and allow them this valuable tool.
Sherk said he expects to see Missouri become right to work in another few weeks. He also said the 6th Circuit ruling makes Ohio a clear candidate for local right-to-work laws since several of those localities will now be bordering right-to-work states.
The example of Warren County, Kentucky, will not be lost in Ohio, he said. Within a few weeks of passing its ordinance, Warren County had 47 different development projects come its way, Sherk said.
“Warren County didn’t know it was missing out on these opportunities until it passed right to work,” Sherk said. “They didn’t know how many doors were being closed. A lot of Ohio townships and cities will look at this and will want to be part of it.”
If local ordinances do take root in Ohio, which is a strong possibility, Sherk expects that other localities will start to pass ordinances in those areas of the country where a statewide option is out of reach for the moment.
Since Maine has a “long and strong tradition of powers given to localities,” it’s possible that it might also act, Sherk said.
Looking ahead to 2018, he anticipates that Minnesota and Pennsylvania could consider new legislation if right-to-work candidates win the governor’s races in those states. Sherk also sees a potential for New Hampshire and Montana in the not-too-distant future.
But even if Republicans take governor’s seats in key states where the GOP is gaining ground, right to work will remain a tough fight, Sherk warned.
“In Pennsylvania, the Legislature is more conservative than it was but the caveat there is that the left has taken control of the [state] Supreme Court,” he said. “So, you could see some judicial high-jinx.”

President Donald Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency has cleaned up more polluted or contaminated sites in less time and at a faster pace than the Obama administration did in all of 2015 and 2016, according to an analysis of government records by The Daily SIgnal.
Wednesday marks the one-year anniversary of the EPA’s Superfund Task Force Report, which includes a list of 42 recommendations for federally funded cleanup efforts at hundreds of polluted and even toxic sites.
An EPA press release highlights progress the agency has made in acting on the task force’s recommendations, including “more direct attention to the sites potentially eligible for partial or full deletion” from the federal Superfund list.
Since Trump took office in January 2017, EPA officials have cleaned up all or part of 13 listed sites, compared with nine sites cleaned up by the Obama administration in 2015 and 2016.
A total of 1,345 sites remain on the Superfund list, according to the EPA.
The agency released a video highlighting Superfund success stories from around the country.

In 1980, Congress passed the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. Widely known as the Superfund program, it provides funds for cleaning up thousands of contaminated sites across the country that include such contaminants as lead, asbestos, dioxin-infused soil, and radiation.
Contaminated locations include industrial facilities, landfills, and mining sites, according to a page on the EPA website detailing the Superfund’s history.
The parties responsible either must clean up the sites themselves or cover the cost of EPA cleanups. If no party is found responsible for contamination, the program provides the EPA with the money and authority to perform the cleanup.
The EPA distinguishes between full and partial deletions of sites from the Superfund list, which the agency uses to identify and prioritize sites that warrant investigation because they are known to have hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants.
Full deletions occur from the Superfund list “when all the remedies are successfully implemented and no further cleanup is required to protect human health or the environment.” Partial deletions occur when portions of a site are cleaned up while others require additional remediation, according to an EPA release.
The agency’s annual list of full and partial deletions of Superfund sites shows the Trump administration well ahead of where remediation efforts were during the final two years of Barack Obama’s eight years as president.
The Trump administration potentially could double the amount of sites deleted from the Superfund list in its first two years, in comparison to what the Obama administration recorded in 2015 and 2016.
“For decades, the Superfund program has been a bonanza for lawyers and remediation companies and a bust for the communities in which the sites are located,” Bonner Cohen, a senior fellow at the National Center for Public Policy Research, told The Daily Signal in an email, adding:
Only now, under the Trump administration, has cleaning up contaminated sites and returning them to local communities in a timely fashion and at an acceptable cost become a priority for EPA.
The average time from Superfund designation to completion of cleanup at a site was about 15 years. This means that an EPA employee assigned to the Superfund program could spend a 30-year career at the agency and oversee the cleanup of a grand total of two sites.
This is an absurd waste of public and private resources, and the Trump EPA is to be applauded for bringing sanity to a program where it has been long absent.
The 2018 update to the task force report says that over the next year, the agency will “continue to expedite cleanups and move sites towards deletion.”
Acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler is scheduled to mark the one-year anniversary of the Superfund task force at an event Wednesday in New Bedford, Massachusetts.
“EPA has improved the health, living conditions, and economic opportunity of thousands of people living near Superfund sites over the past year as the agency worked to implement the Task Force recommendations,” Wheeler said in a press release.
“I am proud of the accomplishments achieved by EPA’s hardworking staff, and we will continue to engage directly with stakeholders and communities near Superfund sites to accelerate cleanup and promote economic revitalization. Our plan to complete Task Force recommendations by the end of 2019 will ensure this work continues as one of EPA’s highest priorities.”
The task force’s complete recommendations are available here.

"New rules will better protect endangered species, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt says. Pictured:  President Donald Trump looks on as Bernhardt speaks July 7 during an event on the environment at the White House.  (Photo: Alex Wong/Getty Images)
The Trump administration is applying new regulations to protect endangered species, rolling back some requirements to ground the policy in scientific and economic factors, the Interior Department announced Monday. 
The regulations, based on the 1973 Endangered Species Act, will “increase transparency and effectiveness and bring the administration of the Act into the 21st century,” the agency said. 
The rules won’t extend the same protections to threatened species as are applied to those already on the endangered list. Nor will they look as far into the future to project what species face extinction.
The changes likely will draw litigation from liberal and environmental groups.  
“The best way to uphold the Endangered Species Act is to do everything we can to ensure it remains effective in achieving its ultimate goal—recovery of our rarest species,” Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said in a prepared statement. 
“The Act’s effectiveness rests on clear, consistent and efficient implementation. An effectively administered Act ensures more resources can go where they will do the most good: on-the-ground conservation,” Bernhardt, who took office in April, said.
>>> Related: The Government Relies on Flawed Data to Determine Endangered Species
 The new reform should make the law more effective in protecting threatened species, said Daren Bakst, senior research fellow in agriculture policy for The Heritage Foundation. 
“For over 45 years, the Endangered Species Act has failed to effectively recover species, with only about 3% of listed species getting delisted due to recovery efforts, largely due to how the federal government has implemented the law,” Bakst said in a written statement, adding:
The Trump administration’s reforms to the Endangered Species Act modernize implementation and better allocate resources to provide protections for truly threatened and endangered species.
While more needs to be done to improve species conservation, the federal government is on the right track by recognizing past mistakes implementing the [Endangered Species Act] and taking steps to correct them. The Trump administration should be commended for these common-sense reforms.
Critics of the administration reportedly say the move stops the Interior Department from considering how climate change will harm a vulnerable species, while environmentalists claim this significantly weakens protections.
The Endangered Species Act directs that determinations to add or remove a species from the lists of threatened or endangered species be based “solely on the basis of the best scientific and commercial information regarding a species’ status.”
Under the new regulations, these will remain the only criteria on which listing determinations are based, according to the Interior Department. 
However, the revisions clarify that standards for de-listing and reclassifying a species ought to consider the same five statutory factors used in listing the species in the first place.  
The Interior Department announcement notes that “in some cases, designation of critical habitat is not prudent.” 
The agency said the new regulations reinstate a requirement that areas where threatened or endangered species are present at the time of listing be evaluated before unoccupied areas. 
The rules also impose a higher standard for unoccupied areas to be designated as critical habitat. An unoccupied area must at the time of designation contain one or more of the physical or biological features essential to the species’ conservation.

"Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, here with President Barack Obama following a toast at the White House on Feb. 22, 2015, sued the Obama administration over a bird called the Gunnison sage grouse days before this photo was taken. (Photo: Mike Theiler/Reuters/Newscom)
Feathers are flying over whether the federal government is overprotecting a rare bird in Colorado, in what critics grouse is an example of lawyers making millions while abusing the Endangered Species Act.
Trial lawyers who collect taxpayer-funded fees under the law file so many suits that they undermine local conservation efforts in Western states, according to government officials, industry advocates, and legal analysts familiar with the situation.
In Colorado, the situation prompted Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat, to sue the Obama administration early last year.
Over 25 years, Colorado officials spent more than $40 million to preserve the habitat of a paunchy, ground-dwelling, chickenlike bird known as the Gunnison sage grouse.
Colorado officials worked in partnership with ranchers in Gunnison County, who voluntarily entered into conservation easements on their property that protected the bird while allowing for robust ranching activities.
In the past few years, the Gunnison sage grouse population not only has stabilized but increased in the part of southwestern Colorado where they’re concentrated, local government figures show.
Even so, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service saw fit to list the species as “threatened” under the Endangered Species Act in November 2014.
Kent Holsinger, a natural resources lawyer based in Denver, says he sees a perverse set of incentives at work that allow green groups such as WildEarth Guardians, a nonprofit environmental group, to file suits that ultimately work against the bird’s environment and the local community.
Under a section of the Endangered Species Act providing for citizen suits, nonprofit environmental groups may bring litigation against the federal government. U.S. taxpayers often foot the bill for the substantial fees the groups pay to their attorneys.
In the U.S. House of Representatives, the Natural Resources Committee has obtained documents from the Justice Department that show U.S. taxpayers paid out more than $15 million in attorney’s fees over four years to cover the costs of lawsuits brought under the Endangered Species Act.
Some lawyers are paid as much as $500 an hour, the documents show.

Time for Reform?
“We desperately need reforms to the Endangered Species Act,” Holsinger said, adding:
So long as these litigation provisions are around, it will create openings for habitual abusers of the law like WildEarth Guardians to continuously sue. They are nothing more than a group of trial lawyers who have found a profitable niche to collect attorney’s fees at taxpayer expense and to perpetuate these legal actions that do no good for the environment or for the community as a whole, but they are very good for WildEarth Guardians.
The Gunnison County ranchers entered into agreements with state officials so they could help to preserve the Gunnison sage grouse while obtaining some level of certainty that they wouldn’t be punished for their ranching activities, Holsinger said.
But, he warned, if “radical environmental groups” continue to litigate and put pressure on government agencies to apply more restrictions, especially where public lands are concerned, it could mean ranchers will be forced to sell their property.
“This is about their livelihood,” Holsinger said of the ranchers. “If they are cut back from the status quo, which is a distinct possibility, then their ability to earn a living will be impacted and that means they will have to sell their property, with the most likely purchaser being a developer.”
Erik Molvar, a wildlife biologist with WildEarth Guardians, sharply disagrees with critics of the Endangered Species Act, including the provision for lawsuits, and said he would prefer no major changes.
“Without the ESA, it would be politics as usual and extractive industries would continue to have the right to drive [wildlife] populations into extinction,” Molvar said. “The ESA was created to make decisions based solely on science so politics could not enter into these decisions. This gets us past the political roadblocks to prevent the extinction of rare species.”
Democratic Governor Sues Obama Administration
In January 2015, WildEarth Guardians and another environmental group, the Center for Biological Diversity, filed separate lawsuits against the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. They argued that the listing of “threatened” for the Gunnison sage grouse doesn’t provide sufficient protection and should be raised to “endangered.”
WildEarth Guardians joined in its suit with Clait Braun, a retired sage grouse researcher with the Colorado Division of Wildlife who since 2000 has operated Grouse Inc., an Arizona-based consulting firm that studies the sage grouse. In the second case, the Center for Biological Diversity joined with the Western Watersheds Project.
A few weeks later, Hickenlooper, a Democrat, filed a lawsuit against President Barack Obama’s Interior Department and the agency’s Fish and Wildlife division in an effort to overturn the “threatened” listing. Gunnison County, which is heavily Democratic, later joined with the governor in the suit.
Colorado Democrats “felt like they had no recourse but to file suit against their own party in Washington, D.C.,” and that “shows just how out of touch the Obama administration is with sound public policy,” Brian Seasholes, director of the Endangered Species Project for the Reason Foundation, said in an interview with The Daily Signal.
“For over two decades now, Gunnison County has been engaged in a very successful effort to boost the sage grouse population, but it appears Fish and Wildlife either failed to properly analyze the facts on the ground or simply ignored what the science said about the bird’s population.”
The “best available science” demonstrates that the Gunnison sage grouse “is not threatened throughout its range,” Hickenlooper’s lawsuit argues, adding:
 The Gunnison Basin population, which comprises the vast majority of the species, is not presently in danger of extinction, nor is it likely to be at risk of extinction in the foreseeable future. In fact, experts cited in [the Fish and Wildlife Service’s] Final Listing Rule estimated that the risk of extinction over the next 50 years is no more than 1 percent. Thus, [the wildlife agency’s] decision to list the Gunnison sage grouse as threatened was arbitrary, capricious, and not in accordance with law.
“The Interior Department’s penalty-based approach to sage grouse conservation is going to harm the bird while Colorado’s approach, which is incentive-based, cooperative, and draws heavily on partnerships, has a proven track record of helping the sage grouse,” Reason Foundation’s Seasholes said.

In the Event of a Meteor Strike 
Paula Swenson, the longtime Democratic chair of the Gunnison Board of County Commissioners, told The Daily Signal that it’s  evident to her that the federal wildlife agency did not rely upon sound scientific data in making its determination. 
She points out that for almost 20 years now, the Fish and Wildlife Service has said that the survival of the Gunnison sage grouse is dependent upon the viability of the Gunnison Basin population, located primarily in Gunnison County and in a small part of Saguache County.
In total, there are about 5,000 Gunnison sage grouse spread throughout southwestern Colorado and southeastern Utah, according to federal figures, with about 85 percent residing in Gunnison Basin.  
Swenson notes that Colorado Parks and Wildlife, the state agency charged with monitoring and providing science on conservation efforts, has determined that the Gunnison sage grouse population is stable and not threatened in the foreseeable future. Moreover, federal officials at the Fish and Wildlife Service concurred with the state’s findings, Swenson explained in an email:
They also agree that the efforts of our local government, property owners and partnerships with state and federal agencies have sustained this population. However, since the six satellite populations, which combined only make up about 15 percent of the total population, are not seeing the same sustainability numbers that the Gunnison [River] Basin is, the [Fish and Wildlife Service] chose to list this species as threatened. The [federal agency] systematically divided the species into Gunnison Basin and all other populations instead of looking at the species viability as a whole. The rationale provided was all speculation, not science.
Swenson said she was incredulous at the reasoning behind the federal agency’s decision-making.
“The reasons for listing that were stated to me included [that] if a disease came into the Gunnison Basin it could wipe out the species, or my favorite [reason]:  A meteor could crash in the Gunnison Basin and wipe out the species.”
Molvar, the WildEarth Guardian biologist, said he is not convinced the population is stable. The main population is probably less than 5,000, he estimates, the “bare minimum to have a stable population.” 
“Even if you believe the Gunnison Basin is stable and secure, you are still putting all your eggs in one basket,” Molvar said. “One major catastrophe like a West Nile virus could wipe out the population and drive it to extinction.”
“The rationale provided was all speculation, not science,” the Democratic chairman of the county commissioners said of federal officials’ designating the Gunnison sage grouse as “threatened.” (Photo: iStock Photos)
Green Lawsuits Seen as the Problem 
John Swartout, a Republican, is a senior policy adviser to Hickenlooper. A bipartisan consensus is emerging in favor of reforming the Endangered Species Act so that it can “live up to its full potential without being so dominated by litigation,” the governor’s adviser said in an interview with The Daily Signal.
The problem is “with the adversarial structure” attached to the law and not U.S. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell or her department, Swartout insisted.
“We have no complaints about the secretary of interior and the people who work with her,” he said, adding:
She has been great to work with and she’s done a lot to be helpful despite the fact that we filed litigation. This has been a bad situation not of her creation. The governor felt like the landowners had done everything we asked them to do and made a superhuman effort. They really stepped up and did everything that was necessary. This isn’t about us being mad at the [Obama] administration. It’s about us having the backs of the people who tried to do what they could to protect the sage grouse.
The Gunnison sage grouse is a close cousin of the greater sage grouse, which resides in Colorado and 10 other Western states. 
In September 2015, the Fish and Wildlife Service declined to list the greater sage grouse as either threatened or endangered under the federal law. But, the Interior Department and Agriculture Department instead have imposed 15 land use amendments covering more than 60 million acres of federal land that restrict activities in the habitat of the greater sage grouse. 
Federal bureaucrats are making a deliberate effort to subdivide species that have few or no biological differences, said Ethan Lane, executive director of both the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association and the Public Lands Council, an advocacy group for Western ranchers who hold grazing permits for public lands.
“The fact that these [grouse] populations have been split off into separate species is done to create more opportunities for lawsuits and this speaks to a big part of the problem with the Endangered Species Act,” Lane told The Daily Signal. “In order to keep the machine pumping, the litigation factory culture that has taken over the environmental community has found that it’s easy to split off populations that are not really so different.”
The land use plans, set in motion by Interior’s Bureau of Land Management and USDA’s Forest Service, impose limits on where livestock can graze with the intent of creating buffer zones around the sage grouse’s habitat. 
State and local officials in Utah, Idaho, and Nevada filed suit to overturn the land use amendments. 
Four environmental groups—WildEarth Guardians, the Center for Biological Diversity, the Western Watersheds Project, and the Prairie Hills Audubon Society—filed a suit against the federal government aimed at closing off what they view as “loopholes” in the amendments. 
The Denver-based Western Energy Alliance filed a separate suit challenging oil and gas restrictions in the land use plans.

Americans who live in or near a community built around a lake should be careful about stepping outside to mow the lawn if the temperature isn’t just right and the grass isn’t a certain height.
They should keep pets indoors. They should forget about using weed killer. And they should be prepared to pony up a steep homeowners association fee.
That’s because there may be snakes in the area protected by the Endangered Species Act of 1973, which imposes stiff penalties and fines for violating its rules and restrictions.
Rob Gordon, a senior research fellow with The Heritage Foundation, discovered the situation while researching the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s 1999 decision to list the Lake Erie water snake as a “threatened” species.
The Fish and Wildlife Service estimated the population of that particular water snake to be somewhere between 1,530 and 2,030 at the time. But just a few years later, the agency revised it to 5,690.
The government either made a “substantial underestimation” with the initial listing or the water snake had “a truly miraculous population growth rate” in a short time, Gordon observes in a recently published research paper that finds the listing process under the Endangered Species Act to be riddled with “erroneous data.”
Gordon concludes that “essentially half of the species” identified by Fish and Wildlife Service officials as “recovered” never should have been listed in the first place.
The regulatory fallout for developers, homeowners, and business owners who run up against the endangered species law is the same regardless of whether federal officials used sound science or flawed methodology, Gordon told The Daily Signal in an interview.
“Once a species is listed, it is regulated and the way it’s regulated doesn’t vary dependent upon the quality of the data the agency used,” Gordon said. “If one listing is legitimate and another listing is illegitimate based on erroneous data, the practical consequences are the same to the property owner or the business owner. He or she still faces the same restrictions whether or not these restrictions are legitimately based on science.”
After reviewing the Fish and Wildlife Service’s documentation in the case of the Lake Erie water snake, Gordon found the agency worked to impose “surreal regulatory hurdles” against a developer who sought to build seven houses on 15 acres.
The Fish and Wildlife Service called for easements to be placed on over five acres of lakefront property that would be donated to a nonprofit organization. The agency also sought a $50,000 “contribution” from the developer to cover construction of a hibernation habitat for the snakes, and creation of a homeowners association that would impose additional restrictions.
‘Federally Funded Fiction’
The case of the Lake Erie water snake “is a small example of the heavy-handed regulatory process for just one of the nearly 1,700 listed species to which landowners and businesses are repeatedly subject across the nation,” Gordon writes in his paper.
Although the government delisted the snake in 2011, numerous restrictions popped up in the meantime.
Homeowners association restrictions stipulated that residents make sure no snake was within 20 feet when applying weed killer to poison ivy, that they not allow cats outside, and that they abide by seasonal height and temperature guidelines for mowing lawns. Collectively, residents also had to provide up to $18,750 for snake research, and allow researchers to have access to their properties.
“This seems really over the top, doesn’t it?” Gordon asked in the interview with The Daily Signal. “And keep in mind that the snake’s actual population numbers were probably undercounted in the first place.”
Gordon describes the recovery figures that Fish and Wildlife officials cite as “federally funded fiction” that dramatically inflate the number of species that genuinely were endangered and subsequently preserved.
“With all the ESA’s costs and burdens, it should perhaps come as no surprise that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is fabricating success stories to cover up this unsustainable mess and substituting fluff for statutorily required reporting regarding the recovery program,” he writes of the law in his paper.
The errors that result in listing species that are not genuinely endangered stem in large part from the “low bar for scientific data” set by the agency, Gordon concluded.
The Endangered Species Act calls for the “best available scientific and commercial data” to be used in the listing process. But here’s the problem, from Gordon’s point of view: Fish and Wildlife officials interpreted this directive to mean the information underpinning a listing doesn’t need to be complete or accurate.
“The agency has not set a high enough bar and sometimes they are using scant or even nonexistent data to list species,” Gordon told The Daily Signal. “They are using speculation and surmise as opposed to verifiable data, and in some instances they won’t even share the data. It’s no wonder that consequently all sorts of species are erroneously listed. That’s what happens when you have weak data standards.”
How bad is the problem?
Of 1,662 plants and animals listed by the Fish and Wildlife Service as either “endangered” or “threatened” in the past 45 years, the government had removed 68 before Gordon published his paper in April.
Of those 68, 11 were removed from the list because they had gone extinct and 19 were removed because of errors in the original data. That leaves 38 species delisted because they were “recovered.”
Taxpayers on Hook for ‘Deceitful Practices’
Under the Endangered Species Act, the conservation process involves “the use of all methods and procedures which are necessary to bring any endangered species or threatened species to the point at which the measures provided … are no longer necessary.”
Endangered species are considered to be at the brink of extinction, while threatened species are considered likely to be so in the near future.
Gordon initially determined that “almost half” of the 38 species listed as “recovered” were actually “false recoveries” because they were based upon original data error.
However, since his paper was published three more species have been delisted and he has concluded that two—the lesser long-nosed bat and the black-capped vireo—were listed based on erroneous data.
For this reason, he now says “essentially half” of the species the Fish and Wildlife Service identified as recovered are not genuine recoveries.
Gordon says he also found other examples of “recovered” species that are really “mixed bags,” meaning the number of recoveries resting on erroneous data could be much higher.
(The full list of delisted species is available here.)
The Daily Signal sought comment from the Interior Department and the Fish and Wildlife Service on Gordon’s findings and whether Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke might consider his recommended reforms. Officials had not responded as of publication.
Unfortunately, U.S. taxpayers are footing the bill for “deceitful practices that portray mistakes as successes,” Gordon told The Daily Signal.
That’s because each listing sets in motion mandatory actions and government expenditures under federal law, he said.
For instance, according to Gordon’s paper, the Fish and Wildlife Service reported in 2014 that the “median cost for preparing and publishing a 90-day finding is $39,276; for a 12-month finding, $100,690; for a proposed rule with critical habitat, $345,000; and for a final listing rule with critical habitat, $305,000.”
“These are just the paperwork costs and the bureaucratic costs of listing species whether they were legitimately listed or if they were listed based on erroneous data,” he told The Daily Signal. “But they are a drop in the bucket compared to the costs borne by private parties such as companies, farmers, and ranchers who have to comply with all kinds of mandates and have to absorb the loss in the value of their land because of their inability to use it and other significant opportunity costs.”

Special Interest Groups Drive Litigation
Gordon points to restrictions the Fish and Wildlife officials sought to impose to protect the Lake Erie water snake as an example of excessively burdensome costs.
Gordon’s paper was the subject of a panel discussion April 25 at The Heritage Foundation where he was joined by Rob Roy Ramey, a wildlife biologist based in Denver, and Jonathan Wood, a lawyer with the Pacific Legal Foundation who specializes in environmental and constitutional law.
Ramey called for greater openness and transparency on the part of federal officials and suggested that all the data Fish and Wildlife officials use in their decisions to list species should be made public.
“That way we have a common currency of accountability available to the entire nation,” Ramey said at the Heritage event. Without access to the data, he said, “there’s no opportunity for reproducibility,” which means listing and delisting decisions may not be based on the best scientific information.
Ramey cited several examples of responses from government officials who resisted information requests. His personal favorite came from a “rogue recovery team member” who said:
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service data was deliberately provided in a format that would not facilitate detailed analysis by those unfamiliar with the manner in which the data was collected.
Other examples included “the data you requested are proprietary,” “we are still using this data,” and “those data may no longer exist.”
Ramey warned that Fish and Wildlife officials who have “cherry-picked” and “fabricated” data to list species as endangered or threatened drew resources away from creatures in genuine need of protection, such as blue whales, California condors, rhinoceroses, and gorillas.
Wood, the lawyer with the Pacific Legal Foundation, a nonprofit headquartered in Sacramento, California, credited Gordon with research that shows how often examples of species recovery touted as successes for the Endangered Species Act “are little more than fake news.”
Special interest groups play a role in the listing process, Wood said at the Heritage event.
“What really drives the Endangered Species Act is litigation,” he said. “The reality is that the listing process is fundamentally broken, it is completely litigation driven, and it is a problem for administrations regardless of party.”
The Obama administration sought to develop a work plan to “seize some control back” over the listing process, Wood told the audience, so that key factors such as a species’ actual vulnerability would be considered and a listing would not be the result of “which special interest group is yelling the loudest.”
Potential Reforms for Interior Department
In his research, Gordon highlighted examples of listings where the initial count of a species population was dramatically off based on flawed methodology. He cited the Monito gecko during his talk at Heritage.
This lizard resides on Monito Island off the coast of Puerto Rico, which spans about 40 acres surrounded by 217-foot cliffs. The initial search Fish and Wildlife officials used as the basis to list the species in 1982 was organized during the day, when 18 lizards were found.
“The problem here is that the lizard is nocturnal,” Gordon told The Daily Signal. “So, if you are walking around during the middle of the day, you are not going to find it. The creature burrows down into rocks. In 2016, they finally did a proper survey during the evening and they came up with an estimate of about 5,000 to 10,000 geckos. That’s what you call a big difference.”
Gordon spelled out several potential reforms that the Trump administration’s Interior Department could embrace under Zinke’s leadership.
For starters, Zinke could issue an order directing the Fish and Wildlife Service “to accurately identify the data that forms the bases for removing or downlisting species,” Gordon writes in his report.
He also recommends that the agency correct the record and acknowledge instances where a species was wrongly declared to have “recovered.”
“Right now, the Fish and Wildlife Service asserts that the listings are driven by science, but in truth the listings are often driven by litigation and the scientific standards are so weak that they are often listing species as endangered when they should never have been listed,” Gordon said, adding:
The first step in correcting the problem is to admit that it exists. What needs to be done now is to go back and look at species that were claimed as recovered and to put your foot down and acknowledge that many of them were not really recoveries and they were based on erroneous data. Then, going forward, they need to make sure future listings are not based on speculation.

"Chesa Boudin, San Francisco's new district attorney, with his wife Valerie Block in a photo posted Friday to his campaign's Facebook account. (Photo: Chesa Boudin for San Francisco District Attorney Facebook) 
Chesa Boudin spent his childhood influenced by members of a radical left and violent domestic terrorist organization. During college, he worked as an English translator for Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez. 
Today, Boudin is the top prosecutor in one of America’s largest cities, gaining laudatory endorsements from a U.S. Supreme Court justice and a U.S. senator, vowing to revolutionize the office to stop what he considers “mass incarceration,” and prosecuting federal immigration agents. 
Within days of being sworn in Jan. 8 as San Francisco’s district attorney, Boudin cleaned house—targeting those in the criminal division in charge of the homicide unit, the general felonies unit, and gang units. 
Boudin, 39, the son of two Weather Underground radicals who were convicted of murder, replaced those officials with former colleagues from the San Francisco Public Defender’s Office. 
In a campaign that he won by fewer than 3,000 votes, Boudin was clear that his top priorities were decreasing incarceration, eliminating cash bail, and refusing to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.
“Our criminal justice system is failing all of us. It is not keeping us safe. It is contributing to a vicious cycle of crime and punishment. More than any country in the history of the world, we have the longest sentences, the largest prison populations, the most bloated law enforcement budgets, and the highest recidivism rates,” Boudin said in a speech after being sworn in.

“We consistently fail to address the needs of survivors of sexual assault; to offer restitution to victims of property crime; to include non-English speakers; to heal the trauma caused by violent crime,” he said. “These failures have led us, as a community, as a nation, to accept the unacceptable.”
During the campaign, Boudin wrote that if elected, he would establish an immigration unit in the San Francisco DA’s office. 
He said the unit would “investigate and prosecute crimes ICE agents commit against members of the community, which include illegal arrests, racial profiling, child endangerment, kidnapping, and even human trafficking.”
Boudin’s campaign website said that ICE is not above the city’s sanctuary law, which he helped craft as a deputy public defender. 
“That’s why the Immigration Unit will investigate these abuses, and when ICE agents break California law and endanger our communities, they will be prosecuted,” the campaign site said. “In addition, if any agents violate our Sanctuary City Ordinance or our State Sanctuary laws and hold our community members for ICE agents, they will be prosecuted.”

Boudin promised that his office would not prosecute based on “quality-of-life” issues, including crimes such as public drug use, vandalism, public defecation and urination, and public solicitation of sex. 
San Francisco faces a growing crisis of homeless residents camped on sidewalks and elsewhere, often engaged in these type of offenses. Other crimes such as car break-ins and thefts also plague the city. 
Boudin’s response to homelessness is a crackdown on what he has called “corporate landlords.”
As a candidate, Boudin said in an ACLU questionaire: “Crimes such as public camping, offering or soliciting sex, public urination, blocking a sidewalk, etc. should not and will not be prosecuted.”
Among his first acts was implementing a new “local option” law under which parents charged with a crime may participate in a diversion program to avoid jail time in order to be with their children. The law covers all misdemeanors and nonviolent felonies. 
I am proud to implement the state's new Primary Caregiver Diversion program, a program obviously close to my heart. This policy will keep children united with their parents and work to end the generational cycle of incarceration. pic.twitter.com/lPwspmvttI
On the day Boudin was sworn in, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor delivered a video message expressing her support:
Chesa, you too are an example that gives hope to so many. It is uncommon for a former public defender to become a district attorney of a major city like San Francisco. Especially a district attorney who spent his childhood visiting parents incarcerated for committing serious felonies. 
Your personal strength and commitment to reforming and improving the criminal justice system is a testament to the person you are and the role model you will continue to be for so many.
Thank you, Justice Sotomayor, for your leadership, the example you set for all of us, and for your thoughtful words of support. I'm humbled by your support of our movement & I promise to do the work required to make our vision of a just society a reality. pic.twitter.com/Y1aE9970FT
Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., also heralded Boudin’s victory in November. 
“Now is the moment to fundamentally transform our racist and broken criminal justice system by ending mass incarceration, the failed war on drugs and the criminalization of poverty,” the self-professed democratic socialist said in a tweet. “Congratulations @chesaboudin on your historic victory!”

Although it was a close race, it isn’t surprising that someone on the far left would become district attorney in San Francisco, said Will Swaim, president of the California Policy Center, a conservative think tank. 
“As an observer of San Francisco politics, this is to be expected given his pedigree of a who’s who of the American left, the family trajectory along with his education and resume,” Swaim told The Daily Signal.
Even as criminal justice reform to reduce recidivism has gained bipartisan support, Swaim said, Boudin’s views on incarceration are well out of the mainstream. 
“I don’t judge someone because his parents were part of a terrorist group, but I would note he views himself as a victim of incarceration,” Swaim said. “These were acts by his parents.”
On Oct. 20, 1981, Boudin’s mother, Kathy Boudin, dropped off the 14-month-old with a babysitter. She then joined Boudin’s father, David Gilbert, as part of a joint operation of the Weather Underground and Black Liberation Army to rob an armored truck in Nanuet, New York. 
The failed robbery ended in the deaths of two police officers and one security guard. Both parents were convicted of murder charges, although they didn’t pull the trigger in the slayings. 
Boudin’s mother attended his inauguration, and he addressed both parents in his remarks: 
The crime you both participated in when I was an infant cost innocent men with families their lives. It did not matter to the DA or the judge that neither of you was armed nor that you did not personally hurt anyone. Those details matter to me. What matters even more is that since that terrible day you and my father have focused your lives on love.
When both his parents were sentenced to prison, two other leaders of the Weather Underground movement, Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn, took care of Boudin in Chicago. 
Ayers and Dohrn were instrumental in the political rise in Chicago of Barack Obama before he became a U.S. senator. Both Ayers and Dohrn participated in bombings and other domestic terror activities, but their cases were dropped because they were tainted by illegal FBI surveillance. 
Boudin’s mother, now 76, was paroled in 2003, but his father, 75, remains in prison. 
Boudin went on to graduate from Yale and Oxford. During graduate school, he traveled to Venezuela, where he worked as a translator for Chavez. In 2009, he wrote an article praising the socialist dictator for doing away with term limits. 
Afterward, he traveled back to the United States to work in the San Francisco Public Defender’s Office. 
Boudin was quoted in The New York Times in 2002 as saying: “Now I’m not angry. I’m sad that my parents have to suffer what they have to suffer on a daily basis,” simply because they were “dedicated to fighting U.S. imperialism around the world.” 
Swaim said he understands the allure of extremist ideologies firsthand. 
“I was a Communist Party member in my early 20s, but I had a family to go back to,” Swaim said. “If it takes a village, Boudin’s village was rigorously Marxist. … I had to see the failures of socialism even as I tried to acquire the worldview. I doubt he has had that struggle. Also, San Francisco usually finds ways to make bad things worse.”
The San Francisco District Attorney’s Office did not respond to phone and email inquiries for this report. 
For several years, a national trend has seen election of  progressive prosecutors focused on curbing incarceration and pursuing fewer drug crimes. 
Those elected include Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx in Chicago, Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, Bexar County District Attorney Joe Gonzales in Texas, and Suffolk County District Attorney Rachael Rollins, who prosecutes cases in a Massachusetts jurisdiction that includes Boston.
Moving from a public defender’s office to become district attorney is unusual, noted John Malcolm, director of the Meese Center for Legal and Judicial Studies at The Heritage Foundation. 
“Anybody whose platform is not prosecuting quality-of-life crimes is taking a very political position that is ominous,” Malcolm told The Daily Signal. “If you don’t prosecute people for having sex in public, defecating [in public], and drug use in public, then San Francisco will be a magnet for lawlessness.”

"House impeachment manager Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., prepares for the continuation of the impeachment trial of the president on Thursday. (Photo: Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call/Getty Images)
House Democrats on Thursday, in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, argued that a crime isn’t necessary to remove a president from office and doubled down on their defense of Joe and Hunter Biden. 
The seven House Democrats who are the impeachment managers, including Reps. Adam Schiff of California and Jerry Nadler of New York, have three days, with up to 24 hours, to make their arguments.  
On Saturday, the president’s legal defense team, which includes White House counsel Pat Cipollone; Trump’s personal lawyer, Jay Sekulow; and former independent counsel Ken Starr, begin their counterarguments. 
After each side presents its case, the Senate will vote on whether to call witnesses to testify. The rules are similar to those used in the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton, who was acquitted. 
It takes a two-thirds vote, or 67 senators, to remove a president from office.  
After a deeply partisan fight over Senate trial rules on Tuesday and speaking for about two hours in Wednesday’s opening argument, Schiff, the lead impeachment manager, was more lighthearted Thursday.
After Chief Justice John G. Roberts opened the day’s session, he said House impeachment managers have 16 hours and 42 minutes left to make their case to the Senate “jurors.” 
Schiff, the House Intelligence Committee chairman, spoke first for his team. 
“I am not sure the chief justice is fully aware of just how rare it is, how extraordinary it is, for the House members to be able to command the attention of senators sitting silently for hours—or even for minutes, for that matter,” he said. “Of course, it doesn’t hurt that the morning starts out every day with a sergeant-at-arms warning you that if you don’t, you will be imprisoned.”
Rep. Sylvia Garcia, D-Texas, spent much of her floor time defending former Vice President Joe Biden, a fellow Democrat, and his son Hunter Biden.  
“Common sense will tell us that this allegation against Joe Biden is false,” Garcia said, adding, “President Trump asked for the investigation into Biden, based on a made-up theory that no one agreed with—no one.”
In 2016, Joe Biden, as vice president, threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid from Ukraine unless the Eastern European nation fired Viktor Shokin, the prosecutor investigating Burisma Holdings. Hunter Biden held a high-paying job on the board of  Burisma at a time when his father was the Obama administration’s point man for Ukraine. 
Garcia said Shokin was corrupt. 
“Calling for Shokin’s replacement would, in fact, increase the chances that Burisma would be investigated,” she said. “In other words, Shokin was corrupt and not investigating allegations against Burisma. So, Vice President Biden was calling for Shokin’s removal, advocating for a replacement, would actually increase the chances of Burisma’s investigation.”
Garcia said Trump wasn’t interested in the Biden allegations in 2017 or 2018, but only became interested in 2019, after Joe Biden became a presidential candidate. 
“Vice President Biden’s conduct was uniformly validated by the witnesses in the House investigation, who confirmed his conduct was consistent with U.S. policy,” she said.
Garcia’s adamant defense of the Bidens opened the door to call them as witnesses, tweeted Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., so the Senate can get answers.
WOW, House managers make extended argument that Hunter Biden’s work w/ Burisma entirely appropriate & no conflict of interest w/ Joe Biden getting rid of prosecutor that had jurisdiction over Burisma. If we call witnesses, gonna need to hear from both Bidens
“WOW, House managers make extended argument that Hunter Biden’s work w/ Burisma entirely appropriate & no conflict of interest w/ Joe Biden getting rid of prosecutor that had jurisdiction over Burisma,” Hawley said. “If we call witnesses, gonna need to hear from both Bidens.”
Democrats spent most of Thursday homing in on the first impeachment article; specifically, abuse of power. 
Nadler said Trump’s conduct “captures the worst fears of our Founders.” 
“Since President George Washington took office in 1789, no president has abused his power in this way,” he said. “Let me say that again: No president has ever used his office to compel a foreign nation to help him cheat in our elections. Prior presidents would be shocked to the core by such conduct.”
Trump has made frequent references to his record, reaching all the way back to George Washington, albeit typically in a more favorable way. 
A July 25 phone conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy led to the Democrat-controlled House’s voting, without support from a single Republican, to impeach Trump for alleged abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. 
During their call, Trump and Zelenskyy referred to Hunter Biden’s highly paid role on the board of Burisma at a time when his father, then the vice president, was the Obama administration’s point man on Ukraine policy. 
According to a White House transcript of the call released by the president, Trump asked Zelenskyy “to look into” Joe Biden’s admission that he forced the firing of a Ukrainian state prosecutor—Shokin—who was investigating Burisma.
“This conduct is not ‘America First,’” Nadler said, taking a swipe at Trump’s 2016 campaign theme. “This conduct is Donald Trump first.” 
Nadler followed with another presidential comparison.
“This presidential stonewalling of Congress is unprecedented in the 238-year history of our constitutional republic. It puts even President [Richard] Nixon to shame,” Nadler said. “Taken together, the articles and the evidence conclusively establish that President Trump has placed his own personal political interests first. He has placed them above our national security, above our free and fair elections, and above our system of checks and balances.”
Nadler later defended the history of the term “abuse of power,” a charge often criticized as being too vague.
“All prior impeachment considered of high office have all included abuse of power,” Nadler said, and referred to the impeachment investigations of Presidents Andrew Johnson, Nixon, and Bill Clinton. 
However, even left-leaning CNN fact-checked that comment and noted that abuse of power was not one of the 11 impeachment articles against Johnson in 1868. The House Judiciary Committee passed three articles of impeachment against Nixon in 1974, one of which was abuse of power. Nixon resigned the presidency before the full House voted. 
The House Judiciary Committee, then run by Republicans, voted out four articles of impeachment against Clinton, a Democrat, in 1998, which included one for abuse of power. The full House only approved two impeachment articles, rejecting the abuse of power charge. The Senate acquitted Clinton in a 1999 trial.
Nadler focused heavily on what he called the “ABCs of impeachment.” 
“Abuse. Betrayal. Corruption. Here are each of the core offenses the Framers [of the Constitution] feared most,” Nadler said. “The president’s abuse of power, his betrayal of the national interest, and his corruption of our elections plainly qualify as great and dangerous offenses.”
Nadler said Trump abused his power by using the clout of his office to “solicit and pressure Ukraine to meddle in our elections.”
Regarding betrayal, the New York Democrat said, “He betrayed vital national interests; specifically, our national security, by withholding diplomatic support and military aid from Ukraine even as it faced armed Russian aggression.”
Regarding corruption, Nadler said, “President Trump’s intent was to corrupt our elections to his personal political benefit.”
“Article One thus charges a high crime and misdemeanor that blends abuse of power, betrayal of the nation, and corruption in elections into a single, unforgivable scheme,” he said. “That is why this president must be removed from office, especially before he continues his effort to corrupt our next election.”
Nadler explained that some Trump defenders note that neither article of impeachment is based on a criminal statute. 
“In a last-ditch legal defense of their client, the president’s lawyers argue that impeachment and removal are subject to statutory crimes or to offenses against established law, that the president cannot be impeached because he has not committed a crime,” he said. 
“This view is completely wrong. It has no support in constitutional text and structure, original meaning, congressional presence, common sense, or the consensus of credible experts. In other words, it conflicts with every relevant consideration,” he continued.
During his presentation, Nadler showed video from one of Trump’s chief advocates, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and one of the president’s lawyers, Alan Dershowitz. 
According to several reports, Graham had left the Senate chamber before a 1999 video clip in which he was featured was displayed. 
The clip showed Graham, then a member of the House, on the Senate floor, acting as a House manager in the Clinton impeachment trial, explaining what he thought a “high crime” was. 
“What’s a high crime? How about if an important person hurts somebody of low means? It’s not very scholarly, but I think it’s the truth. I think that’s what they meant by high crimes,” Graham said in the 1999 video. “Doesn’t even have to be a crime. It’s just when you start using your office, and you’re acting in a way that hurts people, you have committed a high crime,” Graham said in the clip.
Nadler also showed a clip of Dershowitz.
“It certainly doesn’t have to be a crime,” Dershowitz said of impeachment. “If you have somebody who completely corrupts the office of president and who abuses trust and who poses great danger to our liberty, you don’t need a technical crime.”
Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla., laid out the case about an alleged conspiracy by Trump’s inner circle and his personal lawyer, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, and Giuliani associate Lev Parnas, who was indicted and recently spoke out against Trump. 
She attempted to play a recording of a voicemail between Giuliani and Parnas, but the audio didn’t work. 
“Well, I was going to say it’s difficult to hear, but I’m sure you cannot hear that at all,” Demings said. 
“According to phone records, Mr. Giuliani had a one-minute, 50-second call,” Demings, a former Orlando, Florida, police chief said. “Fifteen minutes after they hung up, the records also show that Mr. Giuliani placed three short phone calls to the White House. Shortly thereafter, the White House called Giuliani back. Giuliani spoke with someone at the White House for eight minutes and 28 seconds. 
“I will just quickly note that at the time … the Intelligence Committee issued its report in mid-December, we did not know that eight-minute, 28-second call was from the White House.”
She said neither the White House nor Giuliani provided a recording or transcript of the call. 
Demings said that Trump recalled Marie Yovanovitch from her job as ambassador to Ukraine out of fear that Yovanovitch, a holdover from the Obama administration, would stop the investigations of the Bidens and into suspected Ukraine election meddling in 2016. 
Yovanovitch remains employed with the State Department at no change in pay and teaches at Georgetown University. But Demings said the ambassador’s removal created uncertainty among U.S. diplomats and State Department officials. 
“So, why did President Trump remove a distinguished career public servant and an anti-corruption crusader and a top diplomat in the State Department?” she asked rhetorically. 
“We know why. The answer is simple. President Trump removed Ambassador Yovanovitch because she was in the way,” Demings said. “She was in the way of the sham investigations that he so desperately wanted. Investigations that would hurt former Vice President Biden and undermine the Mueller investigation into Russia election interference, investigations that would help him cheat in the 2020 election.”

"“Every witness who was asked about Hunter Biden’s involvement with Burisma agreed there was a potential appearance of a conflict of interest,"" argues Pam Bondi, a member of President Donald Trump's legal team, pictured arriving Monday for the Senate impeachment trial. (Photo: Andrew Caballero/AFP/Getty Images)
President Donald Trump’s lawyers hit the Senate floor Monday for the second day of defense arguments in his impeachment trial, amid what Democrats called a bombshell from a forthcoming book by the president’s former national security adviser, John Bolton. 
The Bolton book wasn’t a direct topic during the arguments. But the president’s lawyers addressed the underlying allegation that Trump withheld military aid from Ukraine for weeks to pressure the former Soviet republic to investigate dealings there by former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.  
The president’s lawyers also made their strongest case yet as to why Trump had reason to inquire about the Bidens and Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company where the younger Biden had a lucrative job from 2014 to 2019. 
Democrats’ allegation that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy by putting a hold on the $391 million in aid was the basis for the House’s Dec. 18 impeachment of the president on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress—neither of which is a federal crime. 
Here are highlights from the sixth full day of the Senate impeachment trial, in which House Democrats are asking the Senate to convict Trump and remove him from office. 
The New York Times reported Sunday that Bolton’s upcoming book will say Trump told his national security adviser that he would keep a hold on military aid to Ukraine until that country investigated the Bidens’ dealings there. 
Portions of the Bolton book apparently were leaked to the Times. The White House has had a copy of the book since Dec. 30 for a national security review and clearance. 
Titled “The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir,” the book is set to be released March 17.
Trump responded shortly after midnight on Twitter, asserting at one point early Monday: “I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens. In fact, he never complained about this at the time of his very public termination. If John Bolton said this, it was only to sell a book.”
I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens. In fact, he never complained about this at the time of his very public termination. If John Bolton said this, it was only to sell a book. With that being said, the…
…(Democrats said I never met) and released the military aid to Ukraine without any conditions or investigations – and far ahead of schedule. I also allowed Ukraine to purchase Javelin anti-tank missiles. My Administration has done far more than the previous Administration.
Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer had a far different take Monday morning, before the Senate convened for the impeachment trial at 1 p.m.
“This is stunning. It goes right to the charges against the president. Ambassador Bolton essentially confirms the president committed the offenses charged in the first article of impeachment,” Schumer told reporters, adding:
It boils down to one thing. We have first-hand evidence of the president’s actions for which he is on trial. [Bolton] is ready and willing to testify. How can Senate Republicans not vote to call that witness and request his documents? Anyone, anyone who says the House case lacks witnesses and then votes to prevent eyewitnesses from testifying is talking out of both sides of their mouth.
Schumer said the excerpt of Bolton’s book is evidence of a widespread cover-up and shows the need to call acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney as a witness at the impeachment trial.
“There seems to be a giant cover-up among so many of the leading people in the White House who knew and said nothing about it, let alone tried to stop it,” Schumer said, later adding: “If Senate Republicans are not going to vote to call Mr. Bolton and Mr. Mulvaney and the other witnesses now, if they are not going to ask for notes and emails, they are going to be part of the cover-up too. We have this out in the open. It’s up to just four Senate Republicans [to join Democrats in voting to hear from witnesses].”
A few minutes later, during an arrival ceremony Monday for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House South Portico, Trump took a question about whether the manuscript of Bolton’s book would make it more likely his former national security adviser would testify to the Senate. 
“I haven’t seen the manuscript, but I can tell you nothing was ever said to John Bolton.” Trump said. “But I have not seen a manuscript.”
Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, told reporters that the Senate shouldn’t be distracted from the defense of the president being presented Monday. 
“Do not get distracted by the shiny objects of saying ‘We need witnesses’ or Bolton’s new manuscript or anything else,” Collins said. “Don’t lose sight of the fact that the facts haven’t changed.”
The Senate is expected to vote on witnesses Friday. 
The president’s lawyers hit back
both directly and indirectly on the Bolton manuscript. 
“Nothing in the Bolton manuscript
would rise to the level of an abuse of power or impeachable offense,” said Alan
Dershowitz, a Harvard law professor and Democrat who voted for Hillary Clinton
in 2016, but is now part of the Trump legal team. 
“That is clear from the history, that is clear from the language of the Constitution,” Dershowitz said, adding: 
You cannot turn conduct that is not impeachment into impeachable conduct simply by using words like quid pro quo and personal benefit. It is inconceivable that the framers [of the Constitution] would have intended so politically loaded and promiscuously deployed a term as ‘abuse of power’ to be weaponized as a tool of impeachment. It is precisely the kind of vague, open-ended, and suggestive term that the framers feared and rejected.
Other lawyers tackled the underlying allegation that Trump wanted Ukraine to investigate the Bidens—as well as possible Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. election—in exchange for getting the $391 million in congressionally approved security assistance.
“The president wasn’t ‘caught,’ as the House managers allege. The managers are wrong,” deputy White House counsel Mike Purpura said. “All of this, together with what we discussed on Saturday, demonstrates that there was no connection between security assistance and investigations.”  
This assertion appeared to take on directly news reports of what a section of the Bolton book will say. 
Trump’s personal lawyer, Jay Sekulow, didn’t address the Bolton book at all when he took the microphone. But he did argue that Trump was acting within his rights as president. 
“It is our position as president’s counsel that the president was at all times acting under his constitutional authority, under his legal authority, in the national interests pursuant to his oath of office,” Sekulow told senators.  
“Asking a foreign leader to get to the bottom of issues of corruption is not a violation of an oath,” he said.
Former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, now on Trump’s defense team, laid out a timeline for potential conflicts of interest entangling Joe Biden, who oversaw the Obama administration’s Ukraine policy, and his son, Hunter Biden, who held a lucrative seat on the board of Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company.
“The United Kingdom’s Serious Frauds Office opens a money laundering investigation into the oligarch [Mykola] Zlochevsky and his company, Burisma,” Bondi said. “The very next month, April 2014, according to a public report, Hunter Biden quietly joints the board of Burisma. Remember, early 2014 was when Vice President Biden began leading Ukraine policy.”
Bondi noted that public records show the younger Biden’s business partner Devon Archer, also a Burisma board member, met with the elder Biden at the White House two days before the company announced Hunter Biden had joined the board.
“Not even 10 days after Hunter Biden joins the board, British authorities seize $23 million in British bank accounts connected to the oligarch Zlochevsky, the owner of Burisma,” she said, adding:
Did Hunter Biden leave the board then? No. The British authorities had also announced that it had started a criminal investigation into potential money laundering. Then, only then, did the company choose to announce that Hunter Biden had joined the board.
In 2016, Biden, as vice president, threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid from Ukraine unless the Eastern European nation fired Viktor Shokin, the state prosecutor who was investigating Burisma while Biden’s son was on the board.
Bondi noted that news coverage of the appearance of a conflict over the younger Biden’s employment in Ukraine began to pop up in 2014. She read from news clips from The Washington Post, The New York Times, and The New Yorker, and showed part of a story from ABC News about Hunter Biden’s seat on the Burisma board.
Hunter Biden, Bondi said, was paid “significantly more” than most members of corporate boards before leaving Burisma in October 2019.
“Hunter Biden [was] paid over $83,000 a month, while the average American family of four during that time each year made less than $54,000,” Bondi said, adding:
Hunter Biden had no experience in natural gas, no experience in the energy sector, no experience with Ukrainian regulatory affairs. As far as we know, he doesn’t speak Ukrainian. So naturally, the media has asked questions about his board membership.
Bondi also showed a clip of Obama press secretary Jay Carney getting a question about Hunter Biden’s role on the Burisma board, and a later clip of the younger Biden being asked in a TV interview whether he would have gotten the job on the board if his last name weren’t Biden. “I don’t know, probably not,” he responds.
Bondi referred to the House Intelligence Committee’s impeachment hearings, which Rep. Adam Schiff, one of the House impeachment managers, chaired.
“Every witness who was asked about Hunter Biden’s involvement with Burisma agreed there was a potential appearance of a conflict of interest,” she said. 
She read the portion of the official transcript of the Trump-Zelenskyy call that pertained to the Bidens. She then referred to House prosecutors’ claim that any suspicions about the Bidens and Burisma had been “debunked.”
“The House managers talked about 400 times, but they never gave you the full picture,” Bondi said, adding:
Here are those who did: The United Kingdom Serious Fraud Unit, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent … “ABC Good Morning America,” The Washington Post, The New York Times, Ukrainian law enforcement, and the Obama State Department itself. They all thought there was cause to raise the issue about the Bidens and Burisma. …
You’ve heard from the House managers. They do not believe that there was any concern to raise here, that all of this was baseless. All we are saying is that there was a basis to talk about this, to raise this issue, and that was enough.
Eric Herschmann, one of Trump’s private lawyers on the team, also questioned whether impeachment was a means to distract from the Biden conflict. 
The House managers say that President Zelenskyy did not want to get mixed up in U.S. politics, but it precisely the Democrats who politicized the issue. Last August, they began circling the wagons trying to protect Vice President Biden and they are still doing it in these proceedings. They contend that any investigation into the millions of dollars in payments by a corrupt Ukraine company, owned by a corrupt Ukraine oligarch, to the son of the second highest officeholder in our land, who was supposed to be in charge of fighting corruption in Ukraine, they are calling that kind of inquiry a sham, debunked. But there has never been an investigation. So how can it be a sham? Simply because the House managers say so?
In September, at the first public hearing on the Ukraine matter, Schiff, D-Calif., who is leading the House impeachment managers, mischaracterized the Trump-Zelenskyy phone call and when criticized for it, called it a parody.
During his presentation to the Senate, Herschmann was not going to let the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee off easily.
“Remember the fake transcript that manager Schiff read when he was before the Intelligence Committee?” Herschmann asked seantors. “His mob, gangster-like fake rendition of the call?”
“Well, I’ve prosecuted organized crime for years,” Herschmann said. “The type of description of what goes on, what House manager Schiff tried to create for the American people, is completely detached from reality.”
He continued:
It is as if we are to believe that mobsters would invite people they do not know into an organized crime meeting to sit around and take notes to establish the corrupt intent. Manager Schiff, our jobs as prosecutors—I know you were one—would have been a lot easier if that were how it worked.
Think about what he is saying. Think about the managers’ position. That our president decided with corrupt intent to shake down—in their words—another foreign leader. And he decided to do it in front of everyone in a documented conversation in the presence of people he didn’t even know just so he could get this personal benefit that was not in our country’s best interest.
The logic is flawed. It is completely illogical, because that is not what happened.
That is why manager Schiff ran away from the actual transcript. That is why he created his own fake conversation.
Ken Starr, whose investigation as independent counsel led to the 1998 impeachment of President Bill Clinton, gave a mixture of a law professor’s lecture and a warning of what the power of impeachment has wrought. 
“Like war, impeachment is hell, or at least presidential impeachment is hell,” Starr told senators, sitting as jurors in the trial. 
Starr noted that this was not the first House resolution of impeachment against Trump, only the first to pass. 
Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, pushed three impeachment resolutions to a floor vote, all of which were defeated. Other Democrats pushed an impeachment resolution that never came to a vote. 
Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., began in 2017 to promote the “Impeach 45” movement. 
Most of the seven House impeachment managers, or prosecutors, supported either impeaching Trump or beginning an impeachment inquiry against him long before the call with Ukraine’s leader that prompted the current case.
“We are living in what can aptly be described as the age of impeachment,” Starr said, adding:
In the House, resolution after resolution, month after month, has called for the president’s impeachment. How did we get here? With presidential impeachment invoked frequently in its inherently destabilizing as well as acrimonious way.
Presidential impeachment has become a weapon to be wielded against one’s political opponent.
Starr said impeachment should be a “very important protection against serious wrongdoing.”
Despite having brought the case against Clinton that led to his acquittal, Starr said: “Presidents are to serve out their terms unless there is a national consensus for their removal.”
In 1998, Starr was operating under the now-expired independent counsel law that required the prosecutor to submit a report to Congress. 
During his impeachment trial, Clinton was in his second term as president with another two years remaining, and would not face voters again for that office. By contrast,  voters can hold Trump accountable when he seeks reelection in November 2020. 
“There is a huge prudential factor that this trial is occurring in an election year, when we the people in a matter of months will go to the polls,” Starr said. 
Both of the articles of impeachment against Trump, he said, are “dripping with process violations” in the House’s case. 
Starr said the type of case the House has brought against Trump would be thrown out of court. 
“The Constitution speaks in terms of establishing justice. Courts would not allow this,” Starr said. “Because why? They knew and they know that the purpose of our founding instrument is to protect our founding liberties, to safeguard us as individuals against the powers of government.” 
Starr argued that the second article of impeachment, alleging obstruction of Congress, is evidence of a “runaway House.”
“If there is a dispute between the people’s House and the president of the United States over the availability of documents or witnesses, and there is in each and every administration—then go to court,” Starr said. “It really is as simple as that.”
Before his legal team resumed its case Monday morning, Trump sent several tweets. But he mostly retweeted during the arguments. 
READ THE TRANSCRIPTS!
At one point, Trump inquired why Schiff, who is leading the impeachment managers, hasn’t made public the full transcript of testimony by Michael Atkinson, the intelligence community’s inspector general, to the House Intelligence Committee behind closed doors. 
Atkinson took the anonymous whistleblower’s complaint that arose out of Trump’s July 25 phone call to Ukraine’s president. 
Schiff must release the IG report, without changes or tampering, which is said to be yet further exoneration of the Impeachment Hoax. He refuses to give it. Does it link him to Whistleblower? Why is he so adamant?
Later, the president gave a programming note to his Twitter followers:
Senate hearing on the Impeachment Hoax starts today at 1:00 P.M.

Three of the House Democrats prosecuting President Donald Trump in the Senate’s impeachment trial—Jerry Nadler of New York, Zoe Lofgren of California, and Sylvia Garcia of Texas—are among lawmakers who voted last year to advance the president’s removal.
Eight days after that vote, Trump talked by phone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the July 25 call in which the leaders discussed former Vice President Joe Biden and his son’s highly paid role on the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma.
That conversation was the basis for House Democrats’ formal inquiry leading to Trump’s impeachment.
On July 17, however, Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, had brought his third impeachment resolution to the House floor, forcing a procedural vote on articles of impeachment against Trump for disparaging “the squad,” the name for a group of four progressive House freshmen. 
The vote was on whether to allow debate or to table the resolution. The motion failed, with 332 lawmakers voting to table the matter—in other words, against impeachment.
 But 95 Democrats—the highest pro-impeachment tally to that point—voted against tabling Green’s resolution. 
Nadler, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, explained at the time that he wanted to keep options open. 
“I opposed this procedural motion because this article of impeachment should have been referred to the House Judiciary Committee,” Nadler said. “My hope is that future impeachment resolutions be referred here as well, so that they can also be considered as part of the committee’s overall response to clear allegations of presidential misconduct.” 
The Senate trial of Trump began Tuesday based on two articles of impeachment, passed by the House in December and accusing him of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Nadler and the other six House managers, or prosecutors, and the president’s lawyers debated the rules of the trial going forward. 
The House’s Dec. 18 votes to impeach Trump on two charges, taken together, represented the fourth overall impeachment resolution taken up by the full House in some form. 
Other House managers spoke in favor of an impeachment inquiry. 
Nadler voted to table Green’s two previous resolutions.
Four other House managers—House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff of California and Reps. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, Val Demings of Florida, and Jason Crow of Colorado—voted in July to table Green’s resolution. 
Well before the anonymous whistleblower complaint arising from the Trump-Zelenskyy phone call, Crow wrote a piece for Medium calling for an impeachment inquiry and saying: 
I didn’t run for office because I dislike Donald Trump. I ran because I love our country. It’s that same pride in our democracy and respect for our Constitution that fuels my support for an impeachment inquiry. We must complete the work started by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. It’s a solemn responsibility of Congress that the Framers of our Constitution included to protect the rule-of-law.
Green previously forced a procedural floor vote in December 2017 on a resolution accusing Trump of “inciting hatred and hostility.” 
Only 58 Democrats backed this first impeachment resolution in a floor vote, and none of the seven House impeachment managers were among them. 
Long before House Democrats drafted the two articles of impeachment against Trump for “abuse of power” and “obstruction of Congress,” neither of which is a criminal statute, Green argued that evidence of a crime is not necessary to impeach a president. 
Demings didn’t vote for any of the Green resolutions. But shortly after release of the Mueller report in April 2019 and long before the Ukraine controversy emerged, she expressed impatience with the slow pace and frustration with Mueller. 
“We are struggling to justify why we aren’t beginning impeachment proceedings,” said Demings, former police chief of Orlando, Florida, according to Politico. “As a 27-year law enforcement officer, and while I understand we need to see the full report and all supporting documents, I believe we have enough evidence now.”
“Mueller didn’t do us any favors,” Demings added, claiming the special counsel only “left us bread crumbs to follow.”
On May 21, Demings said on CNN: “I just believe we are at the point of opening impeachment proceedings.”
The bulk of arguments Tuesday revolved around whether the Senate would allow witness testimony and the gathering of new documents. 
By late afternoon, the Senate voted along party lines, 53 Republicans to 47 Democrats, to reject an amendment by Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., to subpoena White House documents and witnesses for the trial. 
Democrats had rushed the articles of impeachment through the House and now are calling to slow down the Senate trial, said Marc Short, chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence. 
“We find enormous hypocrisy that in the House Intelligence Committee, we went through a process in which this White House was denied the opportunity to have counsel present, denied the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses, [and] denied the opportunity to bring their own witnesses, all because we were told this has to be rushed through as quickly as possible,” Short told reporters Tuesday at the White House. 
“Yet, what you hear from [Democrats] today is that Senate Republicans are moving too quickly, we have to slow down,” Short said. “Obviously there is enormous hypocrisy. The American people see that. They are ready for this chapter to be over.”

House prosecutors claimed Wednesday that President Donald Trump is trying to “cheat” to win the 2020 election, as opening arguments from each side commenced in the Senate impeachment trial of the president. 
The seven House Democrats who are impeachment managers, acting as prosecutors, made their case against Trump. They include House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff of California and House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler of New York.
Presenting the other side was the president’s legal defense team, which includes White House counsel Pat Cipollone; Trump’s personal lawyer, Jay Sekulow; and former independent counsel Ken Starr.
Under rules approved late Tuesday, each side has a total of 24 hours of speaking time on the Senate floor to make their case, a time allotment that may be spread over three days. 
After each side presents its case, the Senate will vote on whether to call witnesses to testify. The rules are similar to those used in the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton, who was acquitted. 
It takes a two-thirds vote, or 67 senators, to remove a president from office.  
For now, the seven House impeachment managers have up to 24 hours over three days to persuade senators to convict Trump and remove him from office. 
Schiff opened the proceedings with a presentation lasting more than two hours. He used video and text messages to support his case, including 2016 campaign footage and clips from sworn witnesses at the House impeachment hearings in November. 
Here are five dramatic scenes from the second full day of the Senate impeachment trial, which began shortly after 1 p.m. and continued into the night. 
A July 25 phone conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy led to the Democrat-controlled House’s voting, without support from a single Republican, to impeach Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. 
During their call, Trump and Zelenskyy referred to Hunter Biden’s highly paid role on the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma at a time when his father, then-Vice President Joe Biden, was the Obama administration’s point man on Ukraine policy. 
According to a White House transcript of the call released by the president, Trump asked Zelenskyy “to look into” Joe Biden’s admission that he forced the firing of a Ukrainian state prosecutor who was investigating Burisma.
Schiff told the Senate, sitting as a jury, that impeachment and removal of Trump is not about a policy disagreement. 
“We are here today to consider a much more grave matter, and that is the attempt to use the power of the presidency to cheat in an election,” Schiff said. 
Ahead of a presidential election in November, when Trump seeks a second term, Schiff rejected the notion that the matter should be left to voters. 
“The president’s misconduct cannot be decided at the ballot box,” Schiff said, adding:
For we cannot be assured that the vote will be fairly won. In corruptly using his office to gain a political advantage and abusing that office in such a way to jeopardize that national security and the integrity of our elections, in obstructing the investigation into his own wrongdoing, the president has shown he believes that he is above the law and scornful of constraint.


Although one impeachment article alleges Trump was soliciting Ukraine to meddle in the 2020 election, the House impeachment managers brought up Russia again.
This comes despite the conclusion by special counsel Robert Mueller’s team that neither Trump nor his campaign conspired with Russian government operatives to influence the 2016 election. 
Before Schiff became chairman when Democrats reclaimed the House majority in the 2018 elections, the House Intelligence Committee reached a similar conclusion prior to release of the Mueller report. 
Nevertheless, Schiff wasn’t ready to let the subject of Russia go. 
“This is not the first time the president solicited foreign interference in our elections,” Schiff said. “In 2016, then-candidate Trump implored Russia to hack his opponent’s email account—something the Russian military did only hours later. Only hours later. 
“When the president said, ‘Hey Russia, if you’re listening,’ they were listening. Only hours later, they hacked his opponent’s campaign.”
In 2016, Trump’s Democratic rival for the presidency, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, was under FBI investigation for conducting State Department business over an unsecure private email server. 
Weeks after then-FBI Director James Comey announced that he wouldn’t recommend prosecution of Clinton, despite thousands of “missing” emails, Trump talked about the issue on the campaign trail. 
This also came after news that Russia was believed to have hacked the Democratic National Committee. 
“If it is Russia, it’s really bad for a different reason,” Trump said at a rally on July 27, 2016. “Because it shows how little respect they have for our country when they would hack into a major party and get everything.”
“But it would be interesting to see—I will tell you this, Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,” Trump said. “I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. Let’s see if that happens. That will be next.”
Later in the House impeachment managers’ arguments in the Senate, a video clip showed a Trump interview with ABC News after the Mueller investigation concluded, in which Trump was asked if he would report to the FBI if Russia or China offered him negative information on his opponent, or would take the information. 
“I think maybe you do both,” Trump told the network in June. “I think you might want to listen; there isn’t anything wrong with listening. If somebody called from a country, Norway, [and said,] ‘We have information on your opponent’—oh, I think I’d want to hear it.”
Arguing on the Senate floor, Rep. Sylvia Garcia, D-Texas, proclaimed of the clip: “Shocking video.”
Trump apparently weighed in on Schiff’s arguments from the economic conference he was attending in Davos, Switzerland. He took the time for a short tweet, in all capital letters: “NO PRESSURE.”
“NO PRESSURE”
The president was making the point that he did not pressure Zelenskyy to conduct investigations of the Bidens and possible Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 election in order to get $391 million in congressional approved military aid. 
Zelenskyy also has said repeatedly that there was no pressure from Trump. 
Trump defenders and independent legal analysts frequently note that after House Democrats failed in their effort to show Trump had engaged in bribery or extortion, they had to rely on vague charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress—neither of which are crimes in federal statutes. 
However, Schiff pointed to a Government Accountability Office opinion last week that said Trump violated a law called the  Impoundment Control Act in delaying the congressionally approved assistance to Ukraine. 
The California Democrat said the president’s lawyers “pooh-poohed” the GAO’s finding. 
“They are a nonpartisan organization that both parties have come to rely upon, but I’m not surprised they don’t like the conclusion of the GAO because the Defense Department warned them that this was going to be the conclusion,” Schiff said. “And that conclusion was that a hold on aid was not only wrong, it was not only immoral, it was also illegal.”
The GAO provided a legal opinion, not a legally adjudicated decision, and the White House Office of Management and Budget disputed the finding.  
The 1974 Impoundment Control Act provides the executive branch only narrow and limited discretion in spending money appropriated by Congress and signed into law by the president in the budget process. 
“It violated the law, a law that we passed, so that presidents could not refuse to spend money that we allocated for the defense of others and for ourselves,” Schiff said. 
The GAO and a federal court determined that President Barack Obama violated certain laws regarding congressionally approved expenditures, The Wall Street Journal noted. 
Senate Democrats spent most of Tuesday asserting that they were committed to having witnesses testify in the Senate trial. However, before the trial began Wednesday afternoon, Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., threw that desire into question.
During a press conference, Schumer was asked about a possible deal to have testimony from Trump’s former national security adviser, John Bolton, in exchange for testimony from Hunter Biden about his lucrative board position with Burisma Holdings, the Ukrainian energy company, while his father was vice president and Obama’s point man on Ukraine policy.
“That trade is not on the table,” Schumer told reporters. “This isn’t like some fantasy football trade. Trials aren’t trades for witnesses.”
Viktor Shokin, then Ukraine’s prosecutor general, was investigating Burisma in 2016, when Biden visited the country.
Biden boasted on camera at a 2018 event that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees to Ukraine unless the government fired Shokin. He was fired. 
Biden defenders say his threat had nothing to do with the Burisma probe.
Nadler delivered a strong defense of the former vice president on the Senate floor.
“It is true that Vice President Biden helped remove Mr. Shokin, who was widely believed to be corrupt,” Nadler said, adding:
It was official policy of the United States, the European community, and others—in order to fight corruption in Ukraine—to ask that Shokin and [former Ukraine prosecutor Yuriy] Lutsenko be removed. So Vice President Biden, in fulfilling U.S. policy, pressured Ukraine to remove Shokin, not to secure some personal benefit, but to advance the official policy of the United States and its allies.
Nadler invoked the Watergate scandal that enveloped President Richard Nixon as he talked about Trump personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor, who pursued the president’s interest in investigations in Ukraine. 
“Who benefited from this scheme? Who sent Mr. Giuliani to Ukraine in the first place?” Nadler said. 
“Of course, we could rephrase that question, as the former Republican leader of the Senate, Howard Baker, asked it in 1973: What did the president know and when did he know it?”

"“I notified Congress that I would veto any legislation that weakens pro-life policies or encourages the destruction of human life,” President Donald Trump says Friday before a cheering crowd at the 47th annual March for Life in Washington. (Photo: Mark Wilson/Getty Images)
President Donald Trump made history Friday by becoming the first president to make an in-person address to the annual March for Life in Washington, where he asserted that he was the strongest advocate for the unborn ever to sit in the White House. 
“Unborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House,” Trump said to the cheering crowd.
The president outlined how his administration has prevented taxpayers’ money from paying for abortions, both in the U.S. and abroad. 
“I reinstated and expanded the Mexico City policy and we issued a landmark pro-life rule to govern the use of Title X taxpayer funding,” Trump said. 
“I notified Congress that I would veto any legislation that weakens pro-life policies or encourages the destruction of human life,” he said. “At the United Nations, I made clear that global bureaucrats have no business attacking the sovereignty of nations that protect innocent human life.”
Friday marked the 47th annual March for Life to protest the Supreme Court’s  Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 legalizing abortion on demand. 
Previous pro-life presidents—Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush—sent lower-level administration officials to address the pro-life rally in person.
Vice President Mike Pence previously has addressed the event in person, while Trump has delivered a streaming video message. This year, it was Pence who appeared by video and Trump who attended.
“To all the proud Catholics who I know are filling our National Mall today…we want to thank you for your witness.” — @VP @Mike_Pence and @SecondLady Karen Pence address the #MarchforLife. #WhyWeMarch pic.twitter.com/pZobwy0X3y
Trump’s remarks at the rally Friday came just before the opening of the fourth day of the Senate impeachment trial of the Democrat-controlled House’s charges that he abused his power and obstructed Congress. 
Trump made an indirect reference to the impeachment effort in a short speech that often was interrupted by applause. 
“They are coming after me because I am fighting for you, and we are fighting for those who have no voice. And we will win because we know how to win,” the president said. 
With Sens. Mike Lee, R-Utah, and James Lankford, R-Okla., among those behind him onstage, Trump said the pro-life movement also knows how to win and has been winning for years.
Trump said Democratic lawmakers have taken a more extreme position on abortion than any “seen in this country for years and decades, and you could even say for centuries.”
“Nearly every top Democrat in Congress now supports taxpayer-funded abortion all the way up until the moment of birth,” Trump said, adding:
Last year, lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow the baby to be ripped from the mother’s womb right up until delivery. Then we had the case of the Democrat governor in the state of Virginia. … The governor stated he would execute a baby after birth.
Trump was referring to Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat. Appearing on a talk radio show in early 2019, Northam said: “If a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.” 
Trump praised those in attendance for their activism. 
“Young people are the heart of the March for Life. It is your generation that is making America a pro-family, pro-life country,” Trump said, adding:
The life movement is led by strong women, amazing faith leaders, and brave students who carry on the legacy of pioneers before us to raise the conscience of a nation and uphold the rights of our citizens. You embrace mothers with care and compassion. You are powered by prayer and motivated by pure, unselfish love.

Here is video of the president’s entire speech:

"President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appear Tuesday in the East Room of the White House to announce the Trump administration's plan to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. (Photo: Sarah Silbiger/Getty Images)
President Donald Trump, rolling out a Middle East peace plan Tuesday, acknowledged that other presidents since the 1960s have tried and failed to reach a lasting deal between Israel and the Palestinians. 
“I wasn’t elected to do small things or shy away from big problems,” Trump said to applause in the East Room of the White House, standing beside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 
“As I have seen throughout my long career as a dealmaker, complex problems require nuanced, fact-based remedies,” he added.
The Trump administration’s plan would recognize a Palestinian state with a capital in East Jerusalem where the United States would open an embassy, and would “more than double the Palestinian territory,” the president said.
No one will be uprooted from their homes, Trump said, and Israel will need to work closely with Jordan to protect the Temple Mount. The agreement, he said, will require that Palestinians “reject terrorism.”
Palestianian officials have not endorsed the plan, but Trump said the U.S. will promote negotiations. 
“We have an obligation to humanity to get it done,” Trump said.
Netanyahu and his chief rival in the Israeli election, Benny Gantz, both visited Trump and endorsed the plan that the president has said would be the “deal of the century.” 
“You have been the greatest friend that Israel has ever had in the White House,” Netanyahu said to Trump when he took the podium. “Frankly, though we’ve had some great, outstanding friends in these halls, it’s not even close.”    
As the two leaders spoke, drawing repeated applause from the audience, both face removal from office amid intense political challenges—Trump an impeachment trial in the Senate and Netanyahu an indictment in three corruption cases. 
Trump referred to the U.S. Embassy having been relocated from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem on his watch. 
“Under this vision, Jerusalem will remain Israel’s undivided—very important—undivided capital,” Trump said. “But that’s no big deal, because I’ve already done that for you, right?”
Trump said he wants a strong deal for the Palestinians.  
“Our vision will deliver massive commercial investment of $50 billion into the new Palestinian state,” Trump said.
One million jobs would be created for the Palestinians and their poverty rate would be cut in half, the president said.    
“I was saddened by the fate of the Palestinian people. They deserve a far better life,” Trump said. “They deserve the chance to achieve their extraordinary potential.”
“This is the first time Israel has authorized the release of a conceptual map illustrating the territorial compromises it’s willing to make,” the president said.
Netanyahu noted that, unlike previous peace plans, Trump recognizes the Israelis need certain territory to remain secure from terrorist attacks.  
“You recognize that Israel must have sovereignty in places that enable Israel to defend itself by itself,” Netanyahu said. “For too long, far too long, the land of Israel where our patriarchs prayed, our prophets preached, and our kings ruled has been outrageously branded as an illegally occupied territory.”
“Well, today, Mr. President, you are puncturing this big lie.”

In their final day of arguments that the Senate should remove President Donald Trump from office, House Democrats questioned the president’s character and defended former Vice President Joe Biden. 
The seven House Democrats who are impeachment managers, acting as prosecutors, used just over 21 of their allotted 24 hours before concluding their third day of arguments on the Senate floor.  The Senate adjourned just before 9 p.m.
Trump’s legal defense team is scheduled to begin counterarguments Saturday at 10 a.m., but is expected to use only a few hours of the allotted 24 hours and to continue Monday.  The team includes White House counsel Pat Cipollone; Trump personal lawyer Jay Sekulow; constitutional lawyer Alan Dershowitz; and former independent counsel Ken Starr.
After each side presents its case, the Senate will vote on whether to call witnesses to testify. It takes a two-thirds majority, or 67 senators, to remove a president from office. 
Here are highlights from Day 3 of the Democrats’ arguments: 
Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., leader of the House managers, made an impassioned plea to the senators to put themselves “in someone else’s shoes,” in this case, those of Joe Biden. 
“Let’s imagine it wasn’t Joe Biden. Let’s imagine it was anyone of us,” Schiff said, adding:
Let’s imagine the most powerful person in the world was asking a foreign nation to conduct a sham investigation into one of us.
What would we think about it then? Would we think that’s a good U.S. policy? Would we think he has every right to do it? Would we think that’s a ‘perfect’ call?
In 2016, Biden, as vice president, threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid from Ukraine unless the Eastern European nation fired Viktor Shokin, the state prosecutor who was investigating the Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings. 
Hunter Biden, the vice president’s son, held a high-paying job on the board of Burisma at the same time his father was the Obama administration’s point man for Ukraine policy. 
In a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the two men briefly discussed Trump’s interest in Ukraine’s investigating the matter along with Ukraine’s possible meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.
At the time, unknown to Zelenskyy, Trump had put a hold on $391 million in congressionally approved military aid to Ukraine to counter Russian aggression, which he would lift in September.
Both presidents say there was no pressure on Ukraine to begin investigations. 
During his argument Friday on the Senate floor, Schiff brought up former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who Trump recalled to the United States on May 20, the day of Zelenskyy’s inauguration. Yovanovitch continues to work for the State Department. 
“Would you think he [Trump] was abusing the power of his office? And if you would, it shouldn’t matter that it wasn’t you,” Schiff continued. “It shouldn’t matter that it was Marie Yovanovitch. It shouldn’t matter that it was Joe Biden. Because I’ll tell you something; The next time, it just may be you.”
Schiff warned that Trump likely wouldn’t be loyal to his own Republican allies in the Senate if it didn’t benefit him. 
“Do you think for a moment, no matter what your relationship with this president, no matter how close you are to this president, do you think for a moment that if he felt it was in his interest, he wouldn’t ask you to be investigated?” Schiff said. 
“If somewhere deep down below, you realize that he would, you cannot leave a man like that in office when he has violated the Constitution. It shouldn’t matter that it was Joe Biden. It could have been any of us. It may be any of us,” he said. 
Schiff later added, referring to the elder Biden: “Yes, he’s running for president. He’s still a U.S. citizen, and he deserves better than that.” 
Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said Trump’s conduct represented an assault on the character of the country. 
“There’s a toxic mess at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, and I humbly suggest that it’s our collective job on behalf of the American people to try to clean it up,” Jeffries said. “President Trump tried to cheat. He got caught, and then he worked hard to cover it up.”
Jeffries went so far as to talk about impeachment in the context of the Civil War, the Great Depression, World War II, the Jim Crow era, and the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
“America is a great country. We can handle adversity better than any other nation in the world, but what are we going to do about our character?” Jeffries asked, adding:
President Trump tried to cheat and solicit foreign interference in an American election. That is an attack on our character.
President Trump abused his power and corrupted the highest office in the land. That is an attack on our character.
President Trump tried to cover it all up and hide it from the American people and obstruct Congress. That’s an extraordinary attack on our character.
Schiff later made a similar point. 
“You don’t realize how important character is in the highest office in the land until you don’t have it, until you have a president willing to use his power to coerce an ally to help him cheat, to investigate one of our fellow citizens,” Schiff said. 
Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., an impeachment manager who is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, called Trump “a dictator” who must be removed for not cooperating with the House’s impeachment inquiry. 
“President Trump is an outlier. He’s the first and only president to declare himself unaccountable and to ignore subpoenas backed by the Constitution’s impeachment power,” Nadler said, adding:
If he is not removed from office, if he is permitted to defy the Congress entirely, categorically, to say that subpoenas from Congress in an impeachment inquiry are nonsense, then we will have lost, the House will have lost, the Senate certainly will have lost, all power to hold any president accountable.
Nadler, not mentioning that House Democrats didn’t try to enforce their subpoenas through the courts, also said: 
This is a determination by President Trump that he wants to be all powerful. He does not have to respect the Congress. He does not have to respect the representatives of the people. Only his will goes. He is a dictator. This must not stand. That is another reason he must be removed from office.
Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., a former Army Ranger, pushed that military role in buttressing Democrats’ national security argument. 
“This defense would be laughable if this issue wasn’t so serious,” Crow said on the Senate floor, in anticipation of an argument the president’s lawyers will make. “No, the delay wasn’t meaningless. Just ask the Ukrainians sitting in trenches now.”
Crow suggested that former national security adviser John Bolton, who Democrats want as a witness in the trial, might have quit because of the hold on aid to Ukraine. 
“Ambassador Bolton could shed light on that himself if he were to testify,” Crow said. 
Schiff also noted, while on the Senate floor, the huge reliance Ukraine had on the United States, which provides 10% of the country’s military budget.  
“Withholding aid has real consequences on real soldiers and their families,” Schiff said, adding the hold only “emboldened Russia.”
Trump ultimately followed through on military aid to Ukraine to defend itself from Russia, while President Barack Obama did not, Trump’s defenders note. 
Chief Justice John Roberts is presiding over the trial, as is his constitutional duty. Going back to his confirmation hearing, Roberts generally has said he only calls balls and strikes. 
However, on Friday, Schiff broached the subject of having Roberts make the final decision on calling witnesses. Most reports indicate the 45 Senate Democrats and two independents will have a tough time getting four Republicans to join them for a majority to vote for calling witnesses. 
Schiff cited Senate precedent from the 1868 impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson, which ended in acquittal. In that trial, Chief Justice Salmon Chase cast a tie-breaking vote. 
“We have a very capable justice sitting in that Senate chamber empowered by the Senate rules to decide issues of evidence and privilege,” Schiff told reporters. “So if any of these witnesses have a colorable claim that they wish to make or the president on their behalf, we have a justice that is able to make those determinations.”
Crow said he was anticipating the arguments of the president’s defense team, set to begin Saturday. 
“Now since we won’t have an opportunity to respond to the president’s presentation, I want to take a minute to respond to some of the arguments that I expect them to make,” Crow said. 
The Colorado Democrat said the president’s lawyers likely will say that Ukraine eventually got the $391 million in security assistance from the U.S. 
“Regardless of whether the aid was ultimately released, the fact that the hold became public sent a very important signal to Russia that our support was wavering,” Crow said. “The damage was done.”
Crow warned senators that the Trump defense team will “cherry-pick” evidence and advised: “Don’t be fooled.”
Ukraine received the $391 million in military aid only after news broke of a whistleblower complaint about the Trump-Zelenskyy phone call, he said. 
“The scheme was unraveling. He only released it after he got caught,” Crow said of Trump. 
Schiff dismissed the often-repeated line from Trump defenders that the president had sought to address corruption in Ukraine before delivering the aid. 
“He was not trying to end corruption in Ukraine,” Schiff said. “He was trying to aim corruption in Ukraine at Joe Biden.”

Trump’s refusal to cooperate with impeachment investigators could set a dangerous precedent, Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., told senators, in arguing for removing the president from office for obstruction of Congress. 
“All presidents after him with have veto power over Congress’ ability to conduct oversight and the power of impeachment,” Lofgren said.
“The House was not prepared to accept that, and that’s why the House approved Article 2,” she said, referring to the House’s second article of impeachment. 
Lofgren was a member of the House Judiciary Committee during the 1998 impeachment hearings of President Bill Clinton and a congressional staffer during the 1974 impeachment inquiry of President Richard Nixon. 
Over two days of arguments, the seven House impeachment managers prosecuted the case for abuse of power against Trump. The first three hours of Friday’s proceedings closed out their arguments for that first article of impeachment. 
Just before 5 p.m., Democrats began arguing that the Senate should remove Trump from office for obstruction of Congress, charging that the president didn’t cooperate with the House’s impeachment investigation. 
The House sent several subpoenas during the investigation. Cipollone, the White House counsel, wrote a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in October saying that the White House would not provide any documents or witnesses. 
The letter asserted that the impeachment investigation was an attempt both to overturn the results of the 2016 election and to influence the outcome of the 2020 contest.
Republicans, criticizing the second impeachment article, say House Democrats didn’t even attempt to enforce their subpoenas in court. 
The House subpoenaed White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and various other officials, but not Bolton. 
Still, Lofgren accused Trump of ordering nine witnesses to defy House subpoenas. 
“In the history of our republic, no president ever dared to issue an order to prevent even a single government witness from testifying in an impeachment inquiry,” Lofgren said. 
“President Trump abused the power of his office by using his official power in an attempt to prevent every single person who works in the executive branch from testifying before the House,” she said.
In fact, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, which led the investigation, identified 17 current and former Trump administration officials who either were deposed behind closed doors or gave public testimony. 
Trump made no attempt to cooperate with the House investigation, said Rep. Sylvia Garcia, D-Texas, a former state judge. 
“At President Trump’s order, agencies and offices refused to produce documents in response to the committee’s request,” Garcia said. “They refused to allow individual witnesses to do so either.” 
“So let’s recap. No documents. Zero, goose eggs, nada, in response to over 70 requests and five subpoenas.”
Garcia continued: 
No attempt to negotiate. No genuine attempt to accommodate. Categorial, indiscriminate, and unprecedented stonewalling. Again, never in my time as a lawyer or as a judge have I seen this kind of total disrespect and defiance of a lawfully issued subpoena, and all on President Trump’s orders.

President Donald Trump’s lawyers took the Senate floor Saturday morning to open their defense in his impeachment trial, wrapping up their initial arguments within two hours.
The defense’s opening presentation was unusually brief after House Democrats’ impeachment managers stretched their arguments for about eight hours on each of three days. 
Trump’s lawyers have Monday and Tuesday to finish their defense, as each side gets three days and up to 24 hours to make their cases to senators. The House’s seven impeachment managers, urging the Senate to remove Trump from office, used all but about three hours of their allotted time. 
Trump weighed in on Twitter well after the Senate adjourned shortly after noon.  
Any fair minded person watching the Senate trial today would be able to see how unfairly I have been treated and that this is indeed the totally partisan Impeachment Hoax that EVERYBODY, including the Democrats, truly knows it is. This should never be allowed to happen again!
Here are five highlights from the opening arguments of the president’s lawyers. 
The Democrat-controlled House voted Dec. 18 to impeach Trump, alleging he abused his power and obstructed Congress in connection with his July 25 phone call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
In the call, the two men briefly discussed Trump’s interest in Zelenskyy’s investigating possible Ukrainian interference in the U.S. presidential election in 2016 as well as Ukrainian-related actions taken by former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.
House Democrats allege that Trump used the power of his office to solicit Ukraine to interfere in the U.S. presidential election in 2020. 
White House counsel Pat Cipollone countered that it is Democrats’ impeachment effort that seeks to “perpetrate the most massive interference in an election in American history.”
“They’re asking you to remove President Trump from the ballot,” Cipollone said.
If two-thirds of the Senate, or 67 senators, vote to remove a president from office, they also may disqualify him from holding another federal office. 
“They’re asking you to do something that no Senate has ever done, and they’re asking you to do that with no evidence, and that’s wrong,” Cipollone said.
Cipollone said Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff of California, Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler of New York, and the other five House impeachment managers “hid evidence” from the Senate.
The White House counsel pointed to the official transcript of the Trump-Zelenskyy call, ordered released by the president, which shows that both leaders talked about “burden-sharing” in support of Ukraine by other European countries. 
Cipollone said of the House managers:
They come here to the Senate and they ask you [to] remove a president, tear up the ballots in all of your states, and they don’t bother to read the key evidence of the discussion of burden-sharing that’s in the call itself. Now, that’s emblematic of their entire presentation.
They have the burden of proof. And they have not come close to meeting it.

In 2016, Biden, as vice president, threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid from Ukraine unless the Eastern European nation fired Viktor Shokin, the state prosecutor who was investigating the Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings.
Hunter Biden, the vice president’s son, held a high-paying job on the board of Burisma at the same time his father was the Obama administration’s point man for Ukraine policy.
In his July 25 phone call with Zelenskyy, Trump said he would appreciate Ukraine’s investigating the matter along with Ukraine’s possible meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.
At the time, unknown to Zelenskyy, Trump had put a hold on $391 million in congressionally approved military aid to the former Soviet republic to counter Russian aggression, which he would lift in September.
Deputy White House counsel Mike Purpura said the entire case put forward by House impeachment managers melts under what he said were “six key facts”:
First, the transcript shows that the president did not condition either security assistance or a meeting on anything. Second, President Zelenskyy and other Ukrainian officials repeatedly have said there was no quid pro quo and no pressure on them to review anything. 
Third, President Zelenskyy and high-ranking Ukrainian officials did not even know the security assistance was paused until the end of August, over a month after the July 25 call. 
Fourth, not a single witness testified that the president himself [Trump] said that there was any connection between any investigations in security assistance, a presidential meeting, or anything else.
Fifth, the security assistance flowed on Sept. 11 and a presidential meeting took place on Sept. 25 [at the United Nations] without the Ukrainian government announcing any investigations. 
Finally, the Democrats’ blind drive to impeach the president does not and cannot change the fact, as attested to by the Democrats’ own witnesses, that President Trump has been a better friend and stronger supporter of Ukraine than his predecessor.
On the last point, numerous witnesses who testified at the House impeachment hearings made clear that they supported the Trump administration’s policy of providing lethal weapons to Ukraine to defend itself from Russia. 
President Barack Obama’s administration had refused to provide such weaponry.
Zelenskyy and his aides in Ukraine have said on several occasions that they did not believe the U.S. was pressuring them to begin investigations of Burisma and possible Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, which the president’s lawyers were eager to note. 
“Of course, the best evidence that there was no pressure or quid pro quo is the statements of Ukrainians themselves,” Purpura told senators. “The fact that President Zelenskyy himself felt no pressure on the call and did not perceive there to be any connection between security assistance and investigations would, in any ordinary case in any court, be totally fatal to the prosecution.” 
“The judge would throw it out,” he said. “The case would be over. What more do you need to know?”
During their arguments, House members had told senators that, because of a power disparity, it was highly unlikely that Zelensky would challenge an assertion by Trump. 
Purpura dismissed this idea Saturday. 
“How do they try to overcome the direct words from President Zelenskyy and his administration that they felt no pressure? They tell you that the Ukrainians must have felt pressure, regardless of what they said,” Purpura argued, adding: 
They try to overcome the devastating evidence against them by apparently claiming to be mind readers. They know what’s in President Zelenskyy’s mind better than President Zelenskyy does. President Zelenskyy said he felt no pressure. The House managers tell you they know better. 
This is really a theme of the House case. Every time the Democrats say that President Trump made demands or issued a quid pro quo to Zelenskyy on the July 25 call, they are saying that President Zelenskyy and his top advisers are being untruthful.
Jay Sekulow, one of Trump’s personal lawyers, later followed with a similar point about witnesses in the House impeachment hearings, most of whom declined to say, when asked, that they saw in the call a quid pro quo or a bribe. 
“This entire impeachment process is about the House managers’ insistence that they are able to read everybody’s thoughts; they can read everybody’s intentions, even when the principal speakers, the witnesses themselves, insist that those interpretations are wrong,” Sekulow said. 
He said it is well known that Trump is suspicious of foreign aid, noting that the president also reviewed or held up aid to Afghanistan, South Korea, and Pakistan, among other nations.
The president’s lawyers also asserted that Ukraine wasn’t aware that Trump had put a hold on the $391 million in military aid, and never broached the topic with U.S. officials until an Aug. 28 story appeared in Politico. 
The article ran more than a month after the July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelenskyy.
“We know there was no quid pro quo on the call; we know that from the transcript,” Purpura said. “There couldn’t possibly have been a quid pro quo because the Ukrainians didn’t know the security assistance was on hold. … There can’t be a threat without the person knowing he’s being threatened.”
Purpura played video of Democrat-called witnesses telling House members that they did not believe the Ukrainian government was aware that the U.S. aid was being held up until the news story appeared in late August.       
“The House managers are aware that the Ukrainians’ lack of knowledge on the hold is fatal to their case, so they desperately tried to muddy the water,” Purpura said. 
During their presentation to the Senate, House Democrats pointed to an October press conference in which acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said the administration held up the money in part because it wanted Ukraine to investigate interference in the 2016 election. Mulvaney said this concern didn’t include an investigation of the Bidens. 
Responding to Democrats’ repeated assertion that Trump wanted Zelenskyy to do him a favor, and pointing again to the official transcript of the call, Purpura said:
As everyone knows by now, President Trump asked President Zelenskyy to do ‘us’ a favor. And he made clear that ‘us’ referred to our country, and not himself. … There was no mention of the paused security assistance on the call, and certainly not from President Trump.
During his closing argument late Friday, Schiff asserted that Trump thinks that “he is the state.”
Sekulow, who also represented Trump in the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign, addressed another Schiff comment from Friday. 
Schiff asked senators to put themselves in the shoes of Joe Biden, and imagine that Trump had asked for Ukraine to investigate any one of them. 
“Let me begin by saying that you cannot simply decide this case in a vacuum,” Sekulow told senators. “Mr. Schiff said yesterday, I believe it was his father who [told him], you should put yourself in someone else’s shoes. Let’s for a moment put ourselves in the shoes of the president of the United States right now.”
An FBI investigation of Trump for alleged conspiracy with Russia was underway before he was even elected, Sekulow said. Then, a few months into his presidency, Mueller was named as special counsel and investigated the Russian matter for about two years. 
Sekulow read a portion of the Mueller report clearing Trump and his campaign of any conspiracy or coordination with Russia to influence the 2016 election. 
“In their opening statement, several of the House managers tried once again to relitigate the Mueller case,” he said. 
Sekulow pointed out that the Mueller probe cost $32 million in taxpayers’ money and included 2,800 subpoenas, 500 search warrants, and 500 witness interviews.
That investigation, he said, was predicated largely on what the Justice Department’s inspector general later determined to be a faulty FBI process of  seeking a warrant to surveil a Trump campaign adviser, Carter Page. 
“The president had reason to be concerned about the information he was being provided,” Sekulow said, referring to the FBI and other intelligence agencies. “Now we can ignore this. We can make believe this did not happen. But it did.”
Democrats were making a “straw man argument,” he said:
The House managers over a 23-hour period kept pushing this false dichotomy that it was either Russia or Ukraine [that interfered in the 2016 election], but not both. They kept telling you the conclusion of the intelligence community and Mr. Mueller was Russia alone [meddled], with regard to the 2016 elections. The report Bob Mueller wrote was on Russia interference, although there is some information [there] in letters regarding Ukraine.

@DrPaulKengor

Paul Kengor is professor of political science at Grove City College. His latest book is ""A Pope and a President: John Paul II, Ronald Reagan, and the Extraordinary Untold Story of the 20th Century.""
On June 26, 2015, four of the Supreme Court’s liberals joined Justice Anthony Kennedy in discovering a new right to same-sex marriage in the U.S. Constitution, one thereby imposed upon all 50 states.
In response, of course, liberals were jubilant. Their leader, the one who promised to fundamentally transform America, responded by literally illuminating the nation’s house in rainbow colors.
Americans saw all of that. They saw the pictures of their fundamentally transformed White House; they saw other culture-transformers dancing in the streets joyously rejecting what a great country once called the laws of nature and nature’s God.
What they had just achieved was, obviously, something utterly untried and unprecedented. And yet, if you suggested even a slight pause before redefining something as fundamental as the 2,000-year, unquestioned, Judeo-Christian/Western standard for marriage, which has only ever meant a male-female bond—well, then you were nothing more than a homophobe exuding a noxious stream of hate. You couldn’t possibly have any rational reason for your rancid, puzzling position.
The Push to Alter Marriage
But one thing that very few Americans saw, including the millions of same-sex marriage supporters who aren’t especially political or ideological, was the quite revealing celebration among some really radical quarters.
Among them, Communist Party USA and its publication, People’s World—successor to the Soviet-funded and directed Daily Worker—were thrilled with what Anthony Kennedy and friends had done.
For communists, this was a stunning victory, the securing of a long-elusive effort to vanquish the fixed marriage model set forth long ago by nature and the Creator. Indeed, if you thought the White House seemed eager to hoist the rainbow colors, you should have seen the American Communist Party.
In fact, the party of the red flag had been waving the rainbow flag before June 26, 2015. Communist Party USA has been pumping the full “LGBT” agenda for several years now.
The day before Kennedy’s landmark opinion came two pieces in People’s World, one titled “Today in Pride Month history: Homosexuals in Holocaust first publicly recognized” and the other titled, “Today in LGBTQ history: Stonewall Inn made historic landmark.” The actual day of the high court’s decision was marked by a lead article titled “Three in a row: SCOTUS upholds marriage equality, Obamacare, Fair Housing Act.” People’s World was grateful for the court’s work across the board.
This intriguing appreciation from American communists is no surprise to those of us who study communism for a living and thus are forced to read websites like People’s World (as well as the homepage of Communist Party USA) as an occupational hazard. We know that one is far more likely to see the rainbow flag at People’s World nowadays than a red flag with a hammer and sickle.
>>> For more on this, see Paul Kengor’s new book, “Takedown: From Communists to Progressives, How the Left Has Sabotaged Family and Marriage.”
Really, though, the two flags are, in limited but meaningful ways, fighting for certain shared objectives. For today’s communists, the “LGBT” agenda, especially on marriage, is the hammer and sickle to take down the natural, traditional, biblical, Western/Judeo-Christian model for marriage and family that they have long despised. I’ll here very briefly summarize some of the history.
A History of Subverting Family and Religion
Efforts to fundamentally transform marriage and family have been long at work, but never (until now) accepted and pushed by the mainstream. In the past, these efforts were spearheaded by the most dangerous radicals. For two centuries, leftist extremists made their arguments, from the 1800s to the 1960s, characterized by the Communist Manifesto, where Marx and Engels wrote of the “abolition of the family!” Even then, in 1848, Marx and Engels could call “abolition of the family” an “infamous proposal of the communists.”
“Blessed is he who has no family,” Marx wrote to Engels, at best only partly in jest. Marx’s partner in crime detested family and marriage so much that he refused both. The ideological duo fulminated against the “bourgeois claptrap” of marriage, which was merely a “system of housewives held in common.” Engels was carrying the banner to smash monogamy a century before the 1960s New Left adopted the credo.
Efforts to revolutionize family and marriage continued, from socialist utopians like Robert Owen, Charles Fourier, and Albert Brisbane to cultural Marxists in the Frankfurt School such as Herbert Marcuse and Wilhelm Reich to 20th-century leftists and progressives ranging from the Bolsheviks—Lenin, Trotsky, Alexandra Kollontai—to Margaret Sanger, Betty Friedan, Kate Millett, and ’60s radicals Bill Ayers, Bernardine Dohrn, and Mark Rudd.
When Tom Hayden and Robert Scheer ran a “Red Family” colony in near Berkeley in the 1960s, they were merely following the footsteps of socialist-utopian colonies in the 1800s in places like Oneida, New York and New Harmony, Indiana.
Were these “ideological colonists” (to borrow an apt description by Pope Francis) supporting same-sex marriage? Of course, not.
No group of radicals, no matter how unhinged, ever contemplated that. The mere fleeting contemplation, the mere momentary notion, the slightest passing fancy of a man legally marrying another man in the 1850s or 1950s would have been scoffed at as incomprehensible. Such proponents would have been deemed certifiably insane.
And yet, that said, among these far-left elements, the cultural Marxists in particular—the Frankfurt School, Georg Lukacs, Willi Munzenberg, Marcuse, Reich, and allies—and their 1960s New Left inheritors, from Kate Millett to Dohrn, Ayers, Rudd, Hayden, Sheer, and others, sought to fundamentally transform the culture through a new kind of (initially) Freudian-based Marxism that obliterated traditional-religious understandings of sexuality, gender, marriage, and family. For them, their cultural revolution would be achieved through a long march through the institutions, especially academia.
It would take a while, but they were enormously patient, diligent, and ultimately successful. This is where the tectonic shift on marriage and family has taken place. Ask anyone who has lived through it and watched it carefully, and he will tell you that same-sex marriage is a product of our modern universities, which educated today’s culture shapers and fundamental transformers in Hollywood, New York, TV, movies, the media, Google, Facebook, the White House, and on and on.
For the far left, same-sex marriage is the Trojan Horse to secure the takedown of marriage it has long wanted, and countless everyday Americans are oblivious to the older, deeper forces at work. And even more delicious for the left, same-sex marriage is serving as a powerful tool in attacking what the extreme left has always hated most: religion.
Today’s advocates of same-sex marriage need to be aware of the quite insidious deeper historical-ideological forces they are unwittingly allied with and aiding and abetting. Sure, that knowledge still will likely not change their minds, and it isn’t going to reverse the Supreme Court decision, but it’s something that a well-informed, thoughtful person should at least be willing to learn about.
Alas, does this mean that same-sex marriage is a communist plot? Is that what I’m saying here? Of course not. Please, liberals, don’t be simpletons. Add some nuance to the discussion. Don’t caricature something that should be taken seriously. It would be logically ridiculous and historically simplistic to say that the commies have given us same-sex marriage. But what I am saying is that a people do not wake up one morning, head to Starbucks, and then walk to the office and casually dismiss multi-millennia’s worth of prior wisdom, experience, and opinion—what G. K. Chesterton called “the democracy of the dead”—without some busy work by some factions in the years before.
Ground had been plowed to ready this soil. The current state is the end-road of a steady evolution that should not be viewed entirely separate from or totally unrelated to early attacks by the far left. That ideological history matters.
A Historic Shift
A people does not rise up one day in June 2015 and ditch the sacred and natural character of the male-female marital union that served their parents, grandparents, great grandparents, great-great grandparents, great-great-great grandparents, etc. (perhaps I do indeed need to belabor this point, eh?) and the ongoing long line of ancient ancestors who preceded them. All of these relations of ours surely were not mere wild “hate-mongers.”
Yet, if there is one source of clear commonality, from the early 19th to early 21st centuries, it is this: As modern liberalism/progressivism and the Democratic Party have become increasingly secular, often anti-religious, or certainly dismissive of traditional notions of morality, the embrace of same-sex marriage has become possible.
For communists, two centuries ago and still today, that requisite anti-religious secularism has been there all along. Much of the wider American culture, outside of the far left, has also become secular and dismissive of traditional religious teaching on matters like family and marriage. That disregard if not outright rejection of Christian ethics has brought all of these forces full circle in a joint willingness to permanently alter the historic Western/Christian understanding of male-female matrimony.
Take this, for instance, as an illustration: Let’s imagine four people who support redefining marriage via same-sex marriage: The hardcore cultural Marxist professor at “Secular U,” the apolitical soccer mom on Facebook, the gay Episcopal pastor, and the sitcom addict.
They may all come to the “marriage equality” position from entirely different motivations, and otherwise hold little in common ideologically, but they all share one crucial component: Each of them rejects the idea that there is a single, absolute, eternal standard for male-female marriage ordained by nature and nature’s God, and each believes that he can render unto himself the right to abolish any such standard and create his own definitions.
As for communists, they couldn’t care less whatever tags or hashtags or slogans or colors the majority culture uses to redefine marriage and family. To them, the larger objective remains the same: to reject and abolish a traditional Judeo-Christian understanding of marriage and family. They are getting what they’ve long wanted, and they could not have done it without the support of mainstream Americans.
The radical left could never have achieved this ultimate takedown of marriage without the larger public’s acquiescence and assistance. The wider same-sex-marriage-supporting public has been the indispensable handmaiden to the radical left’s ability to at long last alter marriage and family. It has been quite a coup.

"George Soros' goal is to influence the nation’s criminal justice policies from the ground up by boosting progressive lawyers to victory in DA races around the country. (Photo: Thomas Peter/Reuters/Newscom)
George Soros has effectively purchased another district attorney’s seat.
The left-wing billionaire pumped almost $1 million into a Texas district attorney’s race against a Democratic DA who opposes sanctuary cities, according to campaign filings reviewed by The Daily Caller News Foundation.

Soros’ preferred candidate, Joe Gonzales, upset incumbent Bexar County DA Nico LaHood in the Democratic primary Tuesday. LaHood conceded after Gonzales jumped up to a sizable lead as votes were counted.

— Jack Acosta (@JackAcostaKENS5) March 7, 2018

Soros spent $958,000 supporting Gonzales’ cause through a super political action committee, Texas Justice & Public Safety, according to campaign finance records reviewed by The Daily Caller News Foundation. The super PAC churned out attack ads against LaHood, accusing him of being racist. LaHood accused Soros of trying to buy the election for Gonzales. Soros’ super PAC spent $897,000 of his money in the final 30 days before the election, campaign finance documents show.
Gonzales is now considered the favorite to win the DA election for Bexar County, which includes the city of San Antonio and is one of Texas’ largest counties. If he wins, Gonzales will join at least 11 progressive lawyers since 2015 who have won district attorney’s seats thanks to massive financial donations from Soros.
Soros has the routine down. He uses powerhouse Democratic law firm Perkins Coie to set up a super PAC named some variant of “Justice & Public Safety.” The super PAC will surface late in a DA race, using the kind of capital typically reserved for a national political race to fund a series of attack ads benefitting Soros’ preferred candidate, who wins almost every time.
The goal is to influence the nation’s criminal justice policies from the ground up by boosting progressive lawyers to victory in DA races around the country. It’s legal and appears to be working.
Soros poured $7 million into 11 district attorneys’ races across the country between 2015 and 2016, The Washington Times found. Soros’ preferred candidate won in nine of the 11 races. Soros repeated the move in two more races in 2017 tracked by The Daily Caller. Soros spent almost $2 million on the two races. His preferred candidate won both times.
Soros spent just under $1.7 million to help Philadelphia attorney Larry Krasner win his city’s DA seat in November. Soros pushed the money through his Philadelphia Justice & Public Safety super PAC. Soros gave the bulk of the donations, $1.45 million, during the primary, boosting Krasner to victory over a crowded Democratic field. Krasner coasted to victory in the general election. He purged 31 prosecutors in his first few days on the job.
The Democratic billionaire poured another $100,000 into the Portsmouth, Virginia, DA race last November. Soros gave the money through a national super PAC called Justice & Public Safety. His preferred candidate, Democratic incumbent Stephanie Morales, coasted to victory. Remarkably, Soros’ investment in the race received no media coverage until after the voters had cast their ballots.
Soros is also funding third-party organizations, which are, in turn, targeting DA races in the 2018 elections. Soros-funded groups, including the ACLU, are making local DA races a national cause for progressives, which has tilted the playing field in favor of progressive lawyers. Soros’ Open Society Foundations gave the ACLU a $50 million grant in 2014 to fight mass incarceration.
In 2018, the ACLU is “planning voter education and outreach campaigns in district attorney races in California, Florida, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Vermont and possibly North Carolina and Missouri,” McClatchy reports.
The Soros-funded Color of Change PAC is also targeting DA races and seeks to mobilize black voters in favor of progressive candidates.

"""Crimes such as public camping, offering or soliciting sex, public urination, blocking a sidewalk, etc., should not and will not be prosecuted,” Chesa Boudin said during his campaign.

San Francisco’s pee problem could soon get worse.
Chesa Boudin, the urine-and-feces-plagued city’s incoming district attorney, pledged during the campaign not to prosecute public urination and other quality-of-life crimes if elected. Boudin declared victory Saturday night after results showed him winning a plurality of votes in the DA race.
“We will not prosecute cases involving quality-of-life crimes. Crimes such as public camping, offering or soliciting sex, public urination, blocking a sidewalk, etc., should not and will not be prosecuted,” Boudin vowed in response to an American Civil Liberties Union questionnaire during the campaign.
“Many of these crimes are still being prosecuted, we have a long way to go to decriminalize poverty and homelessness,” he lamented.

Boudin’s campaign didn’t return The Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for confirmation that he would follow through on his pledge not to prosecute public urination.
Boudin’s parents were members of the Weather Underground, a domestic terrorist group. Boudin “was raised in Chicago by Weather Underground leaders Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn” after his parents were sent to prison on murder charges while he was a toddler, NBC News reported.
 Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vt., cheered Boudin’s victory in the election. 
“Now is the moment to fundamentally transform our racist and broken criminal justice system by ending mass incarceration, the failed war on drugs and the criminalization of poverty,” the Vermont senator wrote Saturday on Twitter, congratulating Boudin on his “historic victory!”

"San Francisco's Department of Public Works responded to 30,136 cases of “human or animal waste” this year. (Photo: Ivan/Getty Images)
San Francisco residents reported more than 30,000 cases of poop to authorities in 2019, city records show.
As of Monday afternoon, the city’s Department of Public Works responded to 30,136 cases of “human or animal waste” this year, easily topping the 28,353 cases the agency handled in 2018 with a week still to go, according to a Daily Caller News Foundation analysis of publicly available city records. The liberal city is averaging more than 84 poop reports every day, The Daily Caller News Foundation’s analysis found.
Pictures showed a man defecating in a San Francisco grocery store earlier in December. Pictures from the scene showed a man doing the deed in a Safeway aisle and then opening up a store package of toilet paper to wipe himself.

San Francisco Supervisor Matt Haney said in November the city’s poop problem is “not funny” and an embarrassment.
“This is a national embarrassment,” Haney said. “It is also [in] many communities a disgusting, public health crisis, no one should be able to walk about and see poop smeared all over the place, no one should live in these conditions. It is not funny.”
The city launched a $750,000 “poop patrol” in September 2018 to combat the poop plague, though that hasn’t stopped this year’s numbers from topping last year’s numbers.
The city’s incoming district attorney, left-winger Chesa Boudin, pledged during his campaign not to prosecute quality-of-life crimes such as public urination.
“We will not prosecute cases involving quality-of-life crimes. Crimes such as public camping, offering or soliciting sex, public urination, blocking a sidewalk, etc., should not and will not be prosecuted,” Boudin said in response to an American Civil Liberties Union questionnaire, adding that “we have a long way to go to decriminalize poverty and homelessness.”
San Francisco Mayor London Breed, a Democrat, described in a July 2018 interview how the city is drowning in poop. “There is more feces on the sidewalks than I’ve ever seen growing up here,” she said. “That is a huge problem and we are not just talking about from dogs—we’re talking about from humans.” Her office did not return The Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment for this article.

"George Soros, 86, is a Hungarian-American business magnate, philanthropist, and longtime political financier of progressive causes. (Photo: Caro/Heinrich
/Newscom)
As part of his quest to overhaul the American justice system, liberal billionaire George Soros is targeting local prosecutor races like the one in Harris County, a large jurisdiction that includes the city of Houston.
Morris Overstreet, a former judge who was the first African-American elected to statewide office in Texas since Reconstruction, was one of the beneficiaries. Overstreet received $100,000 from Soros in the race for Harris County district attorney.
But in a rare lost bet for Soros, Overstreet was defeated easily in the Democratic primary in March by Kim Ogg, a white woman from a prominent political family who has practiced law in Harris County, where she was born, for nearly 30 years.
Ogg had condemned the Soros donation to Overstreet intended to defeat her, calling it “a last-minute money dump to try to buy the nomination.”
Today, Ogg is the Harris County district attorney-elect after going on to beat the Republican incumbent, Devon Anderson. She won the general election with the aid of about $878,000 from the Soros-funded Texas Safety and Justice PAC.
Soros pledged allegiance to Ogg after his preferred candidate lost.
The money helped buy television ads accusing Anderson of botching a case in which the district attorney’s office ordered a rape victim jailed to guarantee she would show up in court to testify against her attacker.
Associates of Soros helped craft the message of the ads, Ogg’s campaign confirmed to The Daily Signal. The campaign said Soros’ contributions to Ogg equaled more than half of the $1.5 million she raised in total.
This past week, less than a month before she takes office, Ogg expressed a different view of Soros’ campaign contributions.
“Before, I was dismayed he was buying the election,” Ogg said in an interview with The Daily Signal, adding:
It was a last-minute dump [of funds supporting Overstreet]. In my instance, his people came to talk to me after I won the primary, so it was not a last-minute dump. Soros is only half of the story here. My agenda and platform was really set before he spent money in my race, but I am appreciative of the money, as I was with every other dollar.

On Jan. 1, Ogg will begin to try fulfilling the vision she ran on, promising a “significant culture change” defined by taking a more lenient approach to marijuana possession cases, focusing tax dollars on punishing violent criminals, and making it easier for defendants to get out of jail on bond in a county where 70 percent of inmates cannot afford to free themselves before trial.
It’s a set of goals that would seem to match Soros’ preference for how prosecutors do their jobs, using their powerful roles and vast discretion not only to protect public safety but also reduce prison populations and repeat offenses.
Despite these overlapping interests, Ogg insists she doesn’t have a mandate from Soros. In fact, she says she’s never spoken to or met with him.
“I don’t know George Soros,” Ogg said, then repeated: “I don’t know George Soros.”
“I made no promises to Soros or his supporters. The money that helped expose issues here is always a benefit, but I believe voters made their decision not based on the name or identity of a contributor, but on the poor policies and public safety record of my opponent. Plus, I have my own reputation here. In cases of David vs. Goliath, I often represent David. I believe my reputation is intact.”
‘Staggering Amount of Money’
Soros, 86, an American hedge fund manager and philanthropist, is No. 22 on the Forbes list of the world’s billionaires, with a net worth estimated at $20 billion. He finances a variety of liberal political causes, including ones related to education, immigration, climate change, and the environment.
Soros’ philanthropic network, the Open Society Foundations, has spent more than $13 billion over the past three decades on initiatives to defend human rights abroad and shape the democratic process in Eastern Europe.
Soros gave an unprecedented $27 million to various 527 groups trying to defeat President George W. Bush in his 2004 re-election campaign, describing the effort as a “matter of life and death.”
Soros also helped launch the Democracy Alliance, a group of major liberal donors seeking to advance progressive policymaking by investing in organizations such as Center for American Progress, Media Matters for America, and Organizing for Action, which was set up to advance the agenda of President Barack Obama.
Soros has not personally spoken with or met any of the candidates he supported in district attorney races this year and last, his advisers say.
In most of the dozen prosecutor races he helped finance, Soros did not coordinate at all with the candidate he supported, they said. Instead, he operated independently by giving money to various state-level political action committees (PACs) and a national “527” unlimited-money group, each identified by a variation on “Safety and Justice.”
The form of his contributions depended on local and state campaign finance laws, Soros’ advisers say, and in some cases, as in Harris County, the collaboration was more direct.

Soros’ efforts are part of a new, broader push by progressives to locate, prepare, and fund challengers to unseat incumbent prosecutors. Such upsets are notoriously difficult to achieve in local district attorney races, where name recognition and outside interest are usually low and voters give deference to the candidate with a record.
“Criminal justice reform efforts must take many forms,” Whitney Tymas, an adviser on Soros’ project challenging sitting prosecutors, said in a statement to The Daily Signal. Tymas added:
Changing laws and redirecting funding streams is critical. Because of the enormous discretion vested in those who enforce the laws, including prosecutors, it is also important to elect officials who are committed to public safety and equal justice. These officials are a key leverage point in a complicated system.
David Alan Sklansky, a Stanford University professor and former federal prosecutor, told The Daily Signal that only a “handful” of races for the 2,500 district attorneys’ offices nationwide included candidates with “reform-oriented” agendas, and of those that did, most did not involve contributions from Soros.
“In a number of high-visibility district attorney races around the country, incumbents this year were unseated by challengers who promised a more moderate approach to criminal justice, backing away from a simple ‘tough on crime’ agenda and paying more attention to fairness, proportionality, and equity,” Sklansky said. “Many of these successful candidates also pledged to improve the investigation of police shootings, to rein in prosecutorial misconduct, and to be more vigilant in avoiding and correcting wrongful convictions.”
Still, Soros’ role in local prosecutor races is significant. It touches counties big and small, urban and rural; northern, southern, western, eastern, and midwestern. In total, Soros spent nearly $11 million on 12 district attorney races this election cycle, campaign filings show.
A Democrat candidate supported by Soros ultimately won in 10 of the 12 races.

The trend of outside funding worries opponents of Soros’ tactics, including veteran district attorneys who say the outsize contributions threaten prosecutorial independence, which is especially important in a role as powerful and all-encompassing as theirs.
“The amount of money we are talking about is staggering,” said Joshua Marquis, the district attorney of Clatsop County, Oregon, since 1994 and a board member of the National District Attorneys Association.
“And it’s amplified because it’s extremely difficult to raise money as a prosecutor,” Marquis told The Daily Signal, adding:
To ask for money when you are a prosecutor, there is something inherently icky about all of it. The argument on one side is this is good, and it’s just turning on a searchlight and looking at these issues. But that’s naive in the extreme because it’s the money that is funding debates and actual discussions. If you are able to pay for and tell your side of the story over and over again on television ads, you are going to win.
‘Couldn’t Compete’
Matthew McCord faced an uphill challenge to counter his Soros-backed opponent.
McCord, a Republican who ran for district attorney in Henry County, Georgia, was not an incumbent and did not have a prosecutor’s record to run on.
He had $60,000 in his campaign fund and a supportive family, but in September he decided that wasn’t enough. McCord dropped out of the race after learning Soros had contributed $100,000 to a political action committee supporting his opponent, Democrat Darius Pattillo.
“The joke was people were saying to me, ‘You need to fight to the death,’ and I said, ‘To whose death, mine?’” McCord told The Daily Signal in an interview. “Soros apparently had a single-minded mission to make sure I was not successful. I couldn’t compete.”

McCord, a municipal judge and local lawyer, said he ran on a platform similar to Pattillo, a deputy chief assistant district attorney in nearby DeKalb County. McCord said both candidates called for relieving overburdened courts and crowded jails by providing more alternatives to prosecution for low-risk offenders as well as better community outreach.
Pattillo did not respond to a request for an interview from The Daily Signal.
“I am viewed as a fairly centrist conservative,” McCord said. “I don’t know there was much difference between my approach to justice and his [Pattillo]. When did progressives and liberals get a monopoly on the idea of criminal justice reform? Soros doesn’t even know me. He didn’t ask me what my views were or what I would do.”
Soros so far has backed only Democrats in district attorney races, but his advisers insist his support for candidates isn’t based on political party and say Soros would consider making a large contribution to a “reform-minded” Republican prosecutor.
McCord said he doesn’t know if he will run again for district attorney—his dream job. But he said he knows what would stop him from trying.
“I’d rather be a private citizen doing the right thing than be a bought man,” McCord said.
‘A Little Bit of Love’
Prosecutors drive critical decisions in the criminal justice system, choosing when, whether, and against whom to bring criminal charges, as well as making recommendations for sentencing and setting the terms of plea negotiations.
These decisions are receiving more scrutiny at a time where there is a growing bipartisan consensus around the need to reduce incarceration, provide more alternative punishments, and expand rehabilitation opportunities for low-level drug offenders.
As part of this effort, Soros, along with progressive groups advocating racial justice and gender equality, is trying to elect more minority prosecutors in response to what he sees as an insufficient response by incumbent district attorneys to the fatal shootings of black men by police officers.
Several candidates who Soros backed are members of minority groups.
The Reflective Democracy Campaign, an arm of the progressive Women Donors Network, found in a 2015 study that 95 percent of elected local prosecutors were white.

“Of course, what was happening with Black Lives Matter and police shootings was a huge wake-up call [for progressives, who began] realizing how much power these offices have and the need for us to be focused on getting great people elected,” Andrea Dew Steele, president of Emerge America, a candidate-training organization for Democratic women, said in an interview with The Daily Signal.
“District attorney races have historically just been completely ignored, like most down-ballot races, in the progressive and Democratic community,” Steele said. “I am just thrilled to see that if you give a little bit of love to these races, a small investment yields a huge outcome.”
In Chicago’s Cook County, Soros funded one of several groups that helped Kim Foxx, who is black, defeat the incumbent state’s attorney, Anita Alvarez, in the Democratic primary. Foxx then easily beat her Republican general election opponent.
Alvarez drew widespread criticism for her handling of the 2014 fatal police shooting of Laquan McDonald, a black 17-year-old. She took 13 months before charging the Chicago police officer who shot and killed McDonald, a delay that sparked protests.
“Soros’ funding was a big factor in my loss, obviously,” Alvarez, the first female and first Hispanic candidate to be elected as Cook County’s top prosecutor, said in an interview with The Daily Signal. “Some people want to say I lost my election simply because of the McDonald video, but I felt this movement prior to my charging that officer. When you have these outside influences, it’s scary because they don’t know the climate—that Chicago has a serious violent crime problem, a serious gun problem.”

Under Alvarez’s leadership, Cook County created a nationally recognized pretrial diversion program. Diversion is intended to promise low-risk defendants a second chance. Eligible individuals are not prosecuted, but instead receive supervision services such as counseling and job training, and can have their criminal record expunged.
Such diversion programs exist in almost every state, but Cook County’s is considered especially innovative because defendants pay no fee to participate, meaning poorer individuals can benefit from the services.
“It would have been a wonderful thing if George Soros actually would have looked at my record,” Alvarez said. “He probably would have liked what he saw.”
Soros’ money also helped Aramis Ayala upset incumbent Jeff Ashton in the Democratic primary for Florida state attorney for Orange and Osceola counties.
The Soros funding paid for TV ads and mailers accusing Ashton of carrying out racially disparate policies—a claim he denied.
Ayala, a black woman, became the first African-American elected as a state attorney in Florida.
“Race does not explicitly play a role, but in seeking candidates who understand the injustices of the current system, many of them turn out to be African-American or Latino, because it is people of color who have been disproportionately affected by those injustices,” Tymas, the Soros adviser, told The Daily SIgnal.
‘Couldn’t Stop Them’
Last year, Scott Colom took a risky approach to his run for district attorney in a four-county stretch in Mississippi.
Colom, who is black and a Democrat, promised voters he would promote more rehabilitation and less incarceration for drug offenders, especially young people—although he also said he’d be tough on violent criminals.
Voters validated Colom’s agenda. It also was backed by Soros, who gave almost $400,000 to a Mississippi PAC supporting Colom’s campaign to defeat a long-entrenched incumbent, Forrest Allgood, an aggressive prosecutor whose record had been heavily criticized.
That PAC also backed the re-election campaign of another local prosecutor, Hinds County District Attorney Robert Shuler Smith.
Colom now has served a year as district attorney of Mississippi’s 16th District. He has implemented some of his proposed policies, including expanding eligibility for pretrial diversion to defendants arrested for offenses such as selling marijuana.
In an interview with The Daily Signal, Colom said personal experience shapes his worldview. He grew up in Columbus, Mississippi, and watched high school classmates go to prison.
While in law school, Colom interned with the chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in Arusha, Tanzania, witnessing poverty and gaining an understanding of how government policy can hold people back.
“I had the courage to run on this criminal justice reform message based on my own personal convictions, before I had any idea there would be any national money, or a George Soros, supporting me,” Colom said. “I decided to run this way having no idea on how it polled. This is how I believed I should be elected.”

Colom, like Ogg in Harris County, said he didn’t know how Soros learned about who he is and what his positions are.
Colom said he never has been in contact with Soros, or anyone associated with him—and does not plan to connect with him now. He said he learned about Soros’ contribution only after seeing and hearing television and radio ads supporting his election.
Colom said the nearly $400,000 in outside money likely helped him, but that he also raised $150,000 on his own and knocked on doors every day from 3 to 7 p.m. during campaign season.
“This was a trying experience,” Colom said. “The most difficult thing I have done was to run for this office. It is important people get the whole picture of how I ran, not just one aspect of it.”
Colom added:
I don’t know George Soros. Do I think his spending money to spread my message helped me? I think any time your message spreads to more people, that helps that candidate get their message out. But what I emphasize is, the message has to be something someone agrees with. The people agree with my message. The people understand if you can avoid sending someone to prison and avoid the scar of a felony record, you should do that.
Colom’s candidacy for attorney general in Mississippi’s 16th District was one of the first such races that Soros has supported. As the Soros effort spreads, Colom says, it’s a difficult thing for candidates to counter.
“His support is not even something I can accept or decline,” Colom said. “They spend money independent of me. I couldn’t stop them. Honestly, I wouldn’t know who to ask if I wanted them to stop.”
Overcoming ‘Radical Agenda’
Pete Weir was able to halt Soros’ momentum by winning.
Soros dedicated $1.2 million to defeat Weir, the incumbent Republican district attorney of Gilpin and Jefferson counties in suburban Colorado.
Soros contributed to a PAC running negative ads against Weir in support of Democrat challenger Jake Lilly, a former prosecutor and Iraq War veteran. One mailer said the incumbent “can’t be trusted to keep us safe from sex offenders.”
In an interview with The Daily Signal, Weir said he overcame Soros’ influence by emphasizing his 37 years of criminal justice experience. The record, he said, includes a longtime dedication to reform—the cause that Soros says he is promoting.
“There was a backlash and outrage over the negative ads directed to me and an outrage over the prospect of an East Coast billionaire trying to buy our justice system,” Weir said, adding of Soros:
He knows nothing about our community, and what the criminal justice issues are in our counties. But it didn’t change my tactics or the way we campaigned on a positive message, on my experience. What he could not overcome were the relationships we had built in the community.

Weir said he spent about $80,000 on his re-election campaign, using that money to spread the message that his office is “progressive,” combining “aggressive prosecution when it’s called for with innovative, problem-solving courts.”
Weir is a member of the Colorado Commission on Criminal and Juvenile Justice, which has helped pass state legislation reducing prison sentences for drug crimes.
He says he will continue to support reforms as prosecutor, because it’s what residents of Gilpin and Jefferson counties want. Even if he shares some of Soros’ goals, he said, those efforts should be dictated by local officials.
“It sounds immodest to say, but you would be hard-pressed to find another prosecutor in Colorado who has led reform efforts realizing we can do a better job in more areas,” Weir told The Daily Signal. “As a prosecutor community, we realize the system is imperfect and changes can and should be made. But to see some East Coast billionaire who has no idea of local interests acceding to a radical reform agenda at the expense of our democratic process is incredibly dangerous.”
‘Be More Political’
Soros and allied progressive groups say they will continue grooming and supporting prosecutor candidates who share their goals.
Steele, of Emerge America, says she already is looking ahead to the 2018 elections, with plans to recruit and train at least 25 Democratic women to run in district attorney races.
Women, she says, are uniquely sensitive to the consequences of incarceration and, as prosecutors, are likely to use their powers more carefully.
“I am hopeful that Emerge will have women running for district attorney in 2018 and make it onto Soros’ radar screen,” Steele said. “The George Soroses of the world can’t get the outcomes they desire unless you have great candidates. So what we are doing is a critical piece.”
She does not apologize for the aggressive outreach, arguing that because a state’s top prosecutors are elected, the process to become one is inherently political.
“All of these races are political,” Steele said, adding:
You have to run a race in order to win. I would say these races need to be even more political. Because the progressive community wants to see certain outcomes, less mass incarceration, that’s the outcome. In order to see that, we need to win races, and get qualified, good people running for these offices that had previously been uncontested.
Marquis, of the National District Attorneys Association, says he doesn’t doubt the sincerity of Soros and of progressive groups. He emphasizes that many members of the association, which represents state-level district attorneys across the U.S., support reform.
Indeed, the National District Attorneys Association made headlines earlier this year when it endorsed compromise legislation in Congress meant to reduce mandatory minimum sentences for low-level drug offenders in the federal prison system.
Yet Marquis said he worries that despite these efforts, some incumbent members of the association could lose their jobs to better-funded challengers.
“This is the source of great conversation among district attorneys,” Marquis said. “A lot of us are sitting around saying, ‘What if it’s me next? What if I am targeted?’”

"George Soros’ political action committee poured $2.1 million into ordinarily sleepy local races. Pictured: Soros delivers a speech on the sideline of the World Economic Forum annual meeting Jan. 24, 2019, in Davos, Switzerland. (Photo: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images)
Radical social justice activists will serve as the top prosecutors for three major Washington, D.C., suburbs—including the two wealthiest counties in the U.S.—after George Soros’ political action committee poured $2.1 million into ordinarily sleepy local races.
In Virginia’s Fairfax and Arlington counties, the “reformer” attorneys ran on platforms far to the left of the Democratic incumbents, beating them in primary races before ultimately winning the general elections.
In both cases, the incumbents expressed concern for public safety if the Soros-backed candidates took control. They also said that the activists were pushing a national platform about racism and over-incarceration that had no basis in reality in the affluent, liberal jurisdictions.
After losing the Democratic primary to Soros-backed Steve Descano, Fairfax’s longtime prosecutor, Ray Morrogh, warned his fellow party members that safety could be at risk if they elected Descano in the general election. He quit the party to endorse Jonathan Fahey, an experienced prosecutor who was running as an independent, to try to avert a Descano victory.
Descano “is completely unqualified for the office of commonwealth attorney,” Morrogh said in a video. “The only case he tried, he disgraced himself when the judge reversed the conviction because [he] lied in closing argument. This man is not fit to hold office in Fairfax County.”
“I’ve dedicated 36 years of my life to keeping you safe in Fairfax County, and I’ve never asked for anything,” Morrogh continued. “But I love my country, I love this county, and I believe in public safety. I’m asking you, vote for Jonathan Fahey for all the victims in this county.”
Descano narrowly beat Morrogh in the primary after receiving $400,000 from Soros’ PAC, financial disclosures show. Morrogh raised $250,000, with no one donor giving more than $10,000.
Fahey told The Daily Caller News Foundation, “The weird thing is, as a result of Soros pouring money into low-turnout primaries, center-left voters are unquestionably more closely aligned to the Republican candidates than they are to these radical challengers. If the citizens were informed they’d never vote for this.”
With little media coverage of suburban politics, locals seemed unaware of the schism between traditional Democrats and the far-left candidates backed by the New York billionaire’s political fund, Fahey said. Even though Descano only narrowly won the primary with 51% to Morrogh’s 49%, Fahey—the candidate endorsed by Morrogh—received only 38% of the vote in the general election.
Descano received another $200,000 from Soros’ PAC during the general election, while Fahey raised $240,000 with no single massive donor, according to the most recent financial disclosures.
“People just went in and voted party ballots. They tell themselves they’re somehow sticking it to [President Donald] Trump by voting for someone unqualified to be the local prosecutor,” Fahey told The Daily Caller News Foundation. “They want to make a stand, but it’s like, you have a chance to do that and it’s in 2020. It’s self-destructive how Trump kind of owns the Democrats mentally.”
“We have a world right now where the president picks the U.S. attorneys and George Soros picks the top state prosecutors. And that’s a scary world to live in,” he said.
“The Dem politicians don’t actually want it to happen, but they’re afraid to stand up to it because they don’t want to be the next one to be primaried,” Fahey continued. “And the Republicans, I don’t know why they aren’t willing to put resources into pushing back on this.”
The Soros candidates ran on a platform of not prosecuting certain crimes and charging others as misdemeanors when state law says they’re felonies. “Virginia’s felony larceny threshold of $500—the value of stolen goods that gives rise to felony charges instead of misdemeanor charges—is much too low,” Descano wrote in campaign materials.
But prosecutors like Morrogh insisted that regardless of how they feel personally, it is up to the state legislature to pass or repeal laws.
“We are a nation of laws, not men,” Morrogh said, Sun Gazette Newspapers reported. “I’m not a super-legislator.”
Fahey told The Daily Caller News Foundation, “You take an oath to enforce the law and do so fairly and impartially, not just the laws you like or the ones that are popular within your party … If a Republican candidate won and said, ‘I’m pro-gun so I’m not going to enforce any gun laws,’ people would be up in arms.”
Descano has said he won’t charge theft under $1,500 as a felony.
“Property crimes will go up, more victims. Police are so demoralized by this that good police are going to leave, so quality of policing will go down within a year,” Fahey said. “Criminals know where they can commit crimes and not get in trouble, and they will come here.”
“In California they did the same thing and theft is up dramatically,” he continued. “California is our future other than we don’t get the weather. If you look at objective data, it doesn’t work. But Soros has nothing at stake, if it goes poorly here he’s not harmed.”
Police Benevolent Association of Fairfax County President Andrew Wright said in a statement that “The stated goals of Mr. Descano to decrease or eliminate the prosecution of minor theft and drug cases will change our county for years to come.”
An Inner-City Movement Implanted in the Suburbs by a Billionaire
Descano, a tax attorney, raised $800,000—$600,000 of which came from Soros’ PAC, and $75,000 of which came from his own parents.
Soros’ out-of-state group, the Justice & Safety PAC, pushed candidates running on a platform about “criminal justice reform” that originated out of the identity politics movements in inner cities. But this year’s batch ran in quiet, affluent suburbs where those issues plainly didn’t apply, Fahey and Arlington’s Democratic prosecutor said.
“If you take away Soros, there is no organic ‘criminal justice reform’ movement in these counties,” Fahey told the DCNF. “No one is really wanting it, and they’re going to do it anyway.”
Descano’s plan for “progressive justice” includes “ending mass incarceration” and eliminating cash bail.
“I will tackle mass incarceration by ending the practices of charging felonies where misdemeanors are sufficient and charging misdemeanors where a dismissal or diversion would be more appropriate,” he wrote, adding that he believes prosecutors over-charge crimes. “The numbers don’t lie. Far too often race and ethnicity are determining factors in the outcome of one’s experience with the criminal justice system.”
Chap Petersen, a Democratic Virginia state senator who represents Fairfax, said in a Washington Post op-ed that Descano ran primarily on a false narrative that had no applicability to the county.
“A few months ago, Fairfax County was the envy of American municipalities for its system of law enforcement,” he wrote in June. “Its crime rate was the lowest of any jurisdiction with more than 1 million residents in the United States. Its jail population was at its lowest point in 40 years. The county had successfully implemented jail diversion programs for veterans and drug courts to treat the addicted.”
“Morrogh was outspent 2 to 1; his message of quiet competence was drowned by out by a mail and canvassing campaign that used words such as ‘racial profiling’ and ‘mass incarceration’ in describing Fairfax County’s criminal-justice system,” Petersen wrote. “The fact that these buzzwords were largely irrelevant in the low-crime, progressive county didn’t matter. It was a winning message in a primary focused on hardcore partisan voters. By a narrow margin, the Soros-funded campaign was able to unseat Morrogh in favor of a ‘progressive’ champion who has never tried a case in a Virginia courthouse.”
Petersen has fought against the influence of corporations who give large political donations, and said that Democrats should keep in mind that the effect was no less harmful when it was a progressive out-of-state billionaire exerting influence.
“The Soros episode has raised an entirely new cause d’etre: the wealthy dilettante—right or left—who seeks to impose his viewpoint on a jurisdiction (or jurisdictions) to which he has no evident connection,” he wrote. “Say no to billionaires.”
In Arlington, Democratic incumbent Theo Stamos lashed out at Parisa Dehghani-Tafti—who has no experience as a prosecutor—saying that the jail population was at a five-year low under her tenure and that there have been no Chicago-style racial unrest or high-profile police shootings in the tiny Washington suburb.
“Arlington County is of the most educated, progressive, engaged and enlightened communities in the country,” Stamos said, Politico reported in June. “To postulate that unbeknownst to this very active community for the past three decades, all under the watchful eye of Chief Judge William T. Newman, who is an African American pioneer in this community, there has been this malignant and oppressive force at work … is preposterous.”
“I’m not going to apologize for being a prosecutor,” she continued. “I think it’s very misguided to back away from the actual work of prosecution because that’s what does keep communities safe, it’s what gives voice to victims of crime.”
Stamos raised $175,000, while Dehghani-Tafti raised $850,000, $630,000 of which came from the Soros PAC and $80,000 of which came from New Virginia Majority PAC, which is focused on building “power in working-class communities of color.” Arlington is decidedly not working-class, and its largest donors are Soros’ PAC and national unions.
There was no independent or Republican on the ballot to challenge Dehghani-Tafti after her unexpected defeat of Stamos.
‘Independent Expenditures’
Soros’ Justice and Public Safety PAC poured millions of dollars into the three races combined.
The organization is a “super PAC” that runs “independent expenditures” that support the candidates, meaning Soros’ staff was essentially controlling the bulk of the efforts—creating mailers and running polls and digital ads—and simply using the candidates’ names.
In Loudoun County, Virginia, the wealthiest county in America, Buta Biberaj narrowly defeated Republican incumbent prosecutor Nicole Wittmann after the Soros PAC spent $845,000 on her. Wittmann raised $113,000 with no single enormous donation.
The PAC focused almost exclusively on D.C.’s Virginia suburbs, Federal Election Commission records show, and had a 100% victory rate there in the Nov. 5 elections. The only other candidate it backed, a far-left candidate running against a Republican in upstate New York, was defeated.
“George Soros doesn’t know a damn thing about me,” Sandra Doorley, who fended off that challenge, said.
In previous election cycles, Soros’ PAC helped install Kim Foxx, a Chicago prosecutor who gained notoriety for her role in the Jussie Smollett case, and Larry Krasner, a Philadelphia prosecutor who the city’s federal prosecutor blamed for a “culture of disrespect” after a felon allegedly shot six police officers in August.

"I wanted to see for myself what conditions are really like in San Francisco, the nation's most liberal city.  (Photo: Katrina Trinko/The Daily Signal)
SAN FRANCISCO—Call me a poop skeptic.
After years of reading about the alleged horrors of San Francisco, I decided I wanted to see for myself if the City by the Bay was really in such dire conditions.
I’d grown up 30 miles south of San Francisco, occasionally popping in for field trips or shopping or sightseeing. Sure, the city had always had homeless people, but the conditions I read about—needles everywhere, “poop maps” documenting the location of human feces—seemed absurd. 
How bad could it actually be in one of America’s most famous cities?
Could one of the most famously liberal cities in the nation have disintegrated into disaster? 
In 2009, I’d moved away from California. In the decade and change since, San Francisco has undergone a radical transformation. A new wave of top Silicon Valley companies—Twitter, Uber, Facebook—opened headquarters or offices in the city. And while San Francisco hadn’t ever been inexpensive, housing costs soared, with the median housing price more than doubling since 2010.
The 49ers, a football team, retained “San Francisco” in their name, but left famed Candlestick Park, now demolished, for Santa Clara, a California town south and in the middle of Silicon Valley—although San Francisco did gain the Golden State Warriors, a basketball team. 
Uber and Lyft, which first came to San Francisco in 2010, now dominate ride-sharing services, their drivers swooping up and down the city’s famous hills.
Yet one change hadn’t occurred: The city has proudly remained a liberal bastion.
Home to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s congressional district, San Francisco is reliably and overwhelmingly blue in every election (with perhaps a few votes going to the Green Party). 
In just the past year, the city’s Board of Supervisors declared the National Rifle Association to be a “domestic terrorist organization,” and the school board voted first to paint over, and then to hide, a mural of George Washington in one of the city’s high schools—a mural, incidentally, painted by a leftist who strove to show both Washington’s greatness and flaws.
Such actions are just par for the course for San Francisco, a city of more than 884,000 that in the past decade also banned fast-food restaurants from including toys with most children’s meals; prohibited city-funded travel by local employees to 22 pro-life states; raised the minimum wage from $9.79 to $15.59 an hour; and, after banning plastic bags in 2007, first set a 10-cent fee for each nonreusable bag at stores, and then a 25-cent fee per bag.
Yes, leftist insanity has long been the norm for San Francisco. But the liberal would-be-utopia had once been seen as a great city, not a filthy environment full of struggling people. 
In a tweet in December, President Donald Trump wrote: “Nancy Pelosi’s district in California has rapidly become one of the worst anywhere in the U.S. when it come[s] to the homeless and crime. It has gotten so bad, so fast.”
Nancy Pelosi’s District in California has rapidly become one of the worst anywhere in the U.S. when it come to the homeless & crime. It has gotten so bad, so fast – she has lost total control and, along with her equally incompetent governor, Gavin Newsom, it is a very sad sight!
Showing it wasn’t just some “right-wing conspiracy” that San Francisco was falling apart, Oracle, one of the huge tech companies in the region, announced in December that its annual OpenWorld conference was going to Las Vegas for the next three years—costing San Francisco an estimated $64 million in potential revenue. An email from the San Francisco Travel Association, obtained by CNBC, mentioned “poor street conditions” as a factor.
So two days before Christmas, I left my parents’ house and made my way over to San Francisco.
I wanted to see for myself what conditions were really like. Was the middle class being driven away? Was the city as liberal as its politicians suggested? How many people were living on the streets?
Twenty-two thousand steps and four Uber and Lyft drives later, here’s what I saw.
Before arriving in the city, I’d read that the Tenderloin neighborhood—just blocks from a major mall and retail area—is one of the worst.
Sure enough, as soon as I drift away from the retail and go a couple blocks into the Tenderloin, things get, well, smelly.
To my surprise, there are tents everywhere in the neighborhood. Years ago, during the Occupy Wall Street movement, I’d visited an Occupy encampment in Boston.
This seemed similar, although there is one key difference. In Boston, the tents were set up in a park. In San Francisco, the tents are openly obstructing the sidewalk—and not just on one block.
In the course of my day, I see several blocks like this clustered in the Tenderloin neighborhood and vicinity. 
Some are just a block or two away from a police station. San Francisco’s new district attorney, Chesa Boudin, told the ACLU in a candidate questionnaire: “Crimes such as public camping, offering or soliciting sex, public urination, blocking a sidewalk, etc. should not and will not be prosecuted.”
I also notice something that I hadn’t seen much during my years in New York City and Washington, D.C.: homeless women, although far fewer than homeless men.
Nationally, homelessness increased by 2.7% in 2019, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. “Homelessness in California is at a crisis level,” HUD Secretary Ben Carson said in a formal statement. 
Residents of San Francisco likely agree: Three-quarters of respondents to a survey said homelessness in the city was getting worse, and a little over half mentioned it as a top issue, according to a 2019 report from the San Francisco Office of the Controller.
In 2019, San Francisco decided to try keeping three public restrooms open 24 hours a day in the worst areas. It’s not cheap—to keep them clean, one attendant is present during daytime hours and, presumably for safety, two are present at night.
“History has shown that without attendants, public toilets in some of San Francisco’s most challenging neighborhoods are used for drug activity and prostitution, and become targets of vandalism,” writes the San Francisco Chronicle’s Phil Matier. 
Matier also did the math: After looking at the cost of funding the toilets and the amount of times the toilets were used at night, he calculated each restroom use cost the city $28.52. 
In addition to three 24/7 toilets, another 21 public toilets are available at certain hours, funded by the city. “The popular program … provides an alternative to using our streets and sidewalks as a toilet,” states the San Francisco Public Works website.
The toilets advertise that people can dispose of needles there, another sign of San Francisco’s relaxed approach to drugs. Thomas Wolf, a former drug addict who lived on the streets of San Francisco for a few months in 2018, is among those now advocating the city change its approach toward drugs.
Wolf “thinks the city is too wedded to harm reduction—making it safer to use drugs—rather than encouraging people to stop using,” the Chronicle reported in December. “He said he was offered free, clean drug paraphernalia by outreach workers, but doesn’t remember ever being offered a treatment bed or even being asked whether he wanted help quitting. Not once.”
Wolf, who has ceased using drugs and now serves on San Francisco’s Street-Level Drug Dealing Task Force and works for the Salvation Army’s Railton Place as a case manager and life skills coach, estimated that 90% of the homeless he lived with in Tenderloin and the adjacent South of Market neighborhood were addicted to drugs or alcohol.
“With harm reduction, the whole point is to use less while respecting your civil liberties,” Wolf told the Chronicle. “When I was out there homeless and leaving my needles in the street and defecating in the street and urinating in the street, was I protecting your civil liberties?”
Walking around the Tenderloin neighborhood in the morning, I encounter workers washing a sidewalk—and asking homeless people to move.
A worker sprays water right up to the brink of a homeless man’s stuff on the sidewalk. The homeless man, who is shoving his belongings into a bag or backpack, starts shouting at the worker, saying (and I’m editing this since we’re a family news outlet), “The f—, man?” 
He keeps shouting, bellowing sentiments along the lines of “Who the f— do you think you are, f—ing my stuff, man?” as he continues to pack up.
In early December, the Tenderloin Community Benefit District and San Francisco Supervisor Matt Haney announced the beginning of weekly power-washings in the district, instead of monthly. 
David Elliott Lewis, a local who is a community organizer, said, per the press release: “Even though seeing human and animal feces on our sidewalks is a common occurrence, I find it upsetting and disturbing every single time.”
According to RentHop.com, “Tenderloin has been on a winning streak for the ‘poopiest neighborhood’ contest for the past three years. The neighborhood saw 8,644.2 animal/human waste incidents per square mile in 2017, 7,722.8 in 2018, and 6,887.9 so far in 2019.”
Washing sidewalks is hardly the only way the city is addressing the crisis. In the past decade, San Francisco has been on a spending spree to help the homeless. 
“Between 2011 and 2012, SF spent $157 million on homeless services. By the 2015-2016 fiscal year, it was up to $242 million. In the most recent 2019-2020 budget proposals, the figure hit more than $364 million. But the consensus remains that more is needed,” reports Curbed San Francisco, which estimates the homeless population now could be as high as 17,600. 
What’s going on with the tourist areas, attractions that long have drawn people from around the country and the world to San Francisco’s shores?
“The loveliness of Paris seems somehow sadly gay/The glory that was Rome is of another day/I’ve been terribly alone and forgotten in Manhattan/I’m going home to my City by the Bay,” Tony Bennett famously warbled in “I Left My Heart in San Francisco.”
But local business owners are concerned tourists aren’t so tempted these days to explore what was once dubbed the “Paris of the West.”
For years, Pier 39—a mix of kitschy shops, restaurants, a carousel, and the odd street entertainer—has been a top tourist destination. Now, businesses fret, times are a-changing.
“We saw a pretty sharp decline since [2016-2017],” Brian Hayes, who owns seven shops and kiosks on the pier, told ABC7 (KGO-TV). “A lot of it is attributed to the homeless.”
“I know myself I’ll go on vacation, I’ll spend more money, but I have to have a good experience and I don’t want to have to look at the homeless and I don’t want to have to see needles on the ground and human feces. It’s not where you want to go on vacation,” Sandra Fletcher, president of Simco Restaurants, which owns five restaurants on the pier and also is facing more trouble drumming up business, told ABC7.
The day I am there, Pier 39 appears to have its usual hustle and bustle. A pack of people gather around an entertainer boasting that he can pull out the balloon he’s swallowed. A kid shrieks on a bungee flying ride. 
In a store that sells products only for left-handed people, customers browse. The women’s restroom is decently clean, given that it’s a free public one in a high-traffic area.
A little outside Pier 39, I see a man in a wheelchair gliding along, plaintively asking people if they could help him out. He wears a 49ers cap and a red scarf and a checked sports coat, which I hope keeps him warm in this neighborhood right on the water.
In the few blocks between the Pier and Fisherman’s Wharf—another frequent tourist stop, essentially a line of bayside restaurants and food counters selling seafood—I notice one man sleeping on the ground.
In the area around Fisherman’s Wharf, souvenir shops sell swag and gifts that capitalize on the city’s liberal reputation:
I also browse Union Square, rimmed by some of the top shopping destinations of San Francisco: a gigantic, eight-story Macy’s, a Saks Fifth Avenue boasting of carrying “faux fur” in one of its windows, a Tiffany’s with sparkling jewelry in its whimsical Christmas displays, and a sleek Apple Store. A Christmas tree is lit in the square, and an ice skating rink is open for Californians wistfully wanting to capture some taste of a white Christmas.
About a week before my visit, Union Square was where San Francisco strained to restore its reputation. On the heels of the news of the Oracle convention’s move to Vegas, Mayor London Breed declared that San Francisco is a “world class city” and pledged further steps to address homelessness.
Yet as the Chronicle’s Matier noted, Breed’s comments in Union Square came at the same time that “an image of a man with his pants around his knees defecating in a [San Francisco] Safeway aisle was rocketing around the internet and TV.”
For San Francisco, the Oracle convention wasn’t even the first blow. In 2018, tourism and convention bureau SF Travel announced that a medical association, never named, was looking for another location for its conferences after 2023, despite holding the gatherings in the city since the 1980s. 
“Postconvention surveys showed their members were afraid to walk amid the open drug use, threatening behavior and mental illness that are common on the streets,” reports the San Francisco Chronicle.
I see a couple of homeless people around Union Square, but nothing unusual for an urban area. The Union Square neighborhood effectively borders the Tenderloin, however, meaning a confused tourist could easily end up there.
At lunchtime, I pop into a church—one with the glorious architecture, high ceilings, and impressive art characteristic of so many older Catholic churches in the United States.
As the church’s bells chime, the sound of a vigorous snorer fills the lulls in between.
St. Boniface Church, in the Tenderloin neighborhood, allows the homeless to sleep in the pews every weekday through a nonprofit program called the Gubbio Project. 
Around since the 1860s, the parish originally was the religious home of Germans in the city. The current church was built in 1902, and although it escaped the 1906 earthquake, it was ravaged by the subsequent fires. Rebuilding was completed in 1908.
“The Gubbio Project uses the back two-thirds of the sanctuary; the church uses the front one-third to celebrate the daily Mass,” the program states on its website. “This sends a powerful message to our unhoused neighbors—they are in essence part of the community, not to be kicked out when those with homes come in to worship. It also sends a message to those attending Mass—the community includes the tired, the poor, those with mental health issues and those who are wet, cold and dirty.”
The day I arrive at St. Boniface’s, the front of the church glitters with Christmas decorations.
During the Communion service—there isn’t a Mass that day—the church is mostly quiet. During one brief moment, someone starts babbling, only to be told to be quiet by others.  When I look back, I don’t see any of the homeless people actively participating in the religious rites. 
After the service, I explore the rest of the church. Most of the wooden pews—with no padding for comfort—are occupied by a sleeping person. Three people are lying on the floor in the back.
I speak briefly to Michael Bonner, a new employee of the Gubbio Project. When I ask Bonner how the homeless can be helped and what should be done, he speaks of a lack of motivation, of people “going down a path of not caring anymore” instead of having “a fire burning in you.”  
Bonner talks about the need for a work ethic, and how it’s too simplistic to say the homeless problem is an effect of the city’s expensive housing. But he’s also adamant that people need help: “We just can’t give up on the willing,” he says.
I ask him if the homeless people he encounters have loved ones or families who could help. Bonner says most of them are “probably embarrassed to go home” because “you don’t want to hear it from your family anymore” after presumably failing in previous tries to get off the streets.
One of the big tensions in San Francisco—and in the wider Bay Area region—in recent years has been the perceived gulf between the affluent and everybody else. As my colleague Jarrett Stepman has chronicled, California increasingly is becoming a place for the poor and the rich, not the middle class.
So out of curiosity, I walk over to Twitter’s headquarters, just a few blocks away from St. Boniface’s, passing City Hall.  Twitter is just one of several companies—others include Salesforce, Facebook, Square, and Uber—that have come to San Francisco in recent years. 
No doubt the city has seen a business boom: “Citywide, the unemployment rate fell from 9% in 2011 to 2.6% this year, and the number of jobs grew from 543,600 in 2011 to an estimated 730,900 last year, according to state data,” reports the Chronicle.
The area around Twitter is quiet the day I am there, and there is no sign of anyone living—or begging—on the streets. Beneath Twitter’s headquarters is a bougie food hall and a grocery store that, incredibly, makes Whole Foods seem like an affordable option.
In the food hall, I stop for lunch at The Organic Coup—which was basically everything you’d expect from a shop in a  Francisco food hall. It brands itself as the first “organic fast food restaurant” and urges me to “taste the revolution.” 
Apparently, fast-food prices don’t apply in the revolutionary era: My lunch of chicken strips and tater tots, and nary a drink, costs $12.81.
However, the food hall offers plenty of options beyond organic tater tots, including—I kid you not—caviar.
One of my Lyft drivers, whose name I’m not using because I didn’t get his permission to quote him on the record, calls San Francisco a “ridiculous city.”
As we pass a gas station, where regular gas is going for $3.99 a gallon, he notes in frustration that gas where I live is probably significantly cheaper.
My Lyft driver also complains that affordable housing is a joke, saying it means something like a $900,000 for a two-bedroom condo instead of a million. The driver, who moved from Los Angeles to San Francisco 10 years ago, blames San Francisco residents for not allowing more housing, noting it had created a situation where people made a fortune on their own homes’ going up in value but where their children could not afford to buy a home and stay.  
The Lyft driver’s attitude isn’t an anomaly: A 2019 survey conducted by the controller’s office found that 35% of respondents were somewhat or very likely to leave the city in the next three years, including 48% of those 35 or younger. 
Although the city notes that the 35% number is in line with statistics for the past 14 years, data suggests people aren’t merely talking about leaving the city. According to real estate firm Redfin, San Francisco was second only to New York City among American cities with the dubious distinction of losing the most residents in the third quarter of 2019, the most recent period tracked.
And my driver isn’t wrong to be concerned about housing prices. “In 2010, the median sale price for a single-family house in SF came in at $751,000 … But by October of 2019, the California Association of Realtors estimated that a median-priced SF house sold for $1.65 million, more than double the value of a home the same time ten years ago,” reports Curbed SF.
Toward the end of the day, I speak to Anthony Rodriguez, who is sitting on a box next to a man smoking in a tent. Next to the tent is a sofa.
Neither Rodriguez nor the tent man, who doesn’t want to be quoted, knows where the sofa originated. 
Rodriguez is from Oakland, a city across the Bay, but says he’s been in San Francisco for about a month. 
“That’s one thing about San Francisco,” he observes. “You won’t starve.”
The 51-year-old says he’s been homeless since 2015, when his mother died, and that he had been homeless at times prior to that as well. 
Rodriguez tells me a complicated story I have trouble following—and entirely believing—about being discharged from a hospital too soon for an injury he incurred on his knee. 
“I started drinking again because it’s cold out,” he mentions.
Overall, he likes San Francisco, especially because he meets so many people. 
“If I’m lonely and sad, I always like to come out here,” Rodriguez, who doesn’t want his photo taken, tells me. 
He says he has seven children, and that he’s outlived two of his ex-wives. It doesn’t appear that he is in regular touch with any family now. 
The company he finds in San Francisco “fills a void for me,” he says, noting that he’s less depressed here. 
“The police will wake you up,” Rodriguez says, but adds that it’s usually OK to just go across the street when that happens.  
So am I still a poop skeptic? 
After walking all over the city, I’ve seen only one instance of poop (in the Tenderloin neighborhood) and one possible needle (I wasn’t anxious to get close enough to verify)—despite the fact that I kept diligently studying the sidewalk to see if I would spot either feces or needles.
My anonymous Lyft driver, however, says that he regularly sees people shooting up heroin, and notes you can spot the dealers by noticing who has backpacks.
#SanFrancisco politicians have been among the most vocal proponents of reducing inequality… Perhaps, their struggle should start closer to home. https://t.co/4nzW2iNLvf pic.twitter.com/uVqDMHfQre
“In San Francisco’s Tenderloin neighborhood, ‘Tucker Carlson Tonight’ producers filmed drug dealers operating in broad daylight. In the South of Market (SoMa) neighborhood, where many apartments rent for nearly $4,000 a month, the sidewalks were lined with used syringes,” writes Fox News’ Charles Couger.
And in the course of my research, I encounter Twitter accounts that portray a dirtier reality than what I happened to observe:
""Giant human feces against the wall near the main door of 701 Minna. This is the third time I've reported this shit, and all the tickets have been closed. But this shit is still here."" (SOMA, D6) https://t.co/FUpg94ep7P pic.twitter.com/PbgorJF4si

Needles cover the sidewalk Across the st from Mikes Bikes, at 1220 Howard st.  @311. Small business are domed under these conditions.

More and more needles line the sidewalks of San Francisco Average home value on this block is around 2 million. That’s around $27,000 in taxes every year and your street looks like this…715 Clementina st @SF311 #filthySF #SF #needles #drugsareillegal pic.twitter.com/7bSCrRw2XN
At the end of the day, the increased power-washing and presence of public restrooms show the city has a real problem with these issues. But if you’re thinking about a trip to San Francisco, I wouldn’t skip it on account of these matters—just make sure you know where the bad neighborhoods are, and be sure to avoid them if you’re concerned.
In the weeks since I visited San Francisco and started writing this article, I’ve caught myself often thinking about the homeless people I saw—from the man who was barefoot on the street in the Mission District, to those I saw on the sidewalks from my passing car, to the man rushing to pack up his belongings as a worker sprayed the sidewalk near him.
I don’t pretend to know the exact policy solution that will “solve” homelessness—although I hope to do further reporting and interviews this year at The Daily Signal to talk to experts who have insightful ideas on ways to help.
But any visitor to San Francisco can tell the current situation isn’t working—for tourists, for residents, and perhaps most importantly, for the homeless themselves.
No doubt, mental health and addiction, perhaps both in many or most cases, make helping the homeless while respecting individual rights uniquely challenging.
But as clichéd as the term is, it’s genuinely heartbreaking to walk through blocks of people, spending their lives on the streets, often seemingly in a drugged haze—and sometimes passed out entirely. 
I can’t imagine tents provide much shelter against the chilly, Bay-driven winds of San Francisco, or that anyone who feels driven to defecate on the street is truly in his right mind.
Seeing this at Christmastime—when most of the country was on the cusp of days of joyful celebrations, ample family time, presents galore, and gourmet meals—was especially upsetting.
The status quo in San Francisco has a real human cost.
The left long has prided itself on having more compassion for, and solutions for, the poorest Americans than the right does.
But if one thing is clear when walking around San Francisco, it’s that this liberal bastion has absolutely failed some Americans who are struggling the hardest right now.

On the anniversary of September 11, students at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign joined with Americans across the country in holding an observance of the tragedy that rocked our nation 9 years ago. It was at this event that some students crossed the line, according to a letter to the editor submitted by a university administrator and published in the student paper last week. What was their offense? They dared to show pride in their country.
Administrator David Green’s letter reads exactly like the shrill, anti-American prose we’ve come to expect from some members of academia:
The vast majority of 9/11 observances in this country cannot be seen as politically neutral events. Implicit in their nature are the notions that lives lost at the World Trade Center are more valuable than lives lost in Afghanistan, Iraq, Palestine and elsewhere; that the motives of the 9/11 attackers had nothing to do with genuine grievances in the Islamic world regarding American imperialism; and that the U.S. has been justified in the subsequent killing of hundreds of thousands in so-called retaliation.
The observance at Saturday’s football game was no different. A moment of silence was followed by a military airplane flyover; in between, Block-I students chanted “USA, USA.” This was neither patriotism nor remembrance in any justifiable sense, but politicization, militarism, propaganda and bellicosity. The University is a public institution that encompasses the political views of all, not just the most (falsely) “patriotic.” Athletic planners should cease such exploitation for political purposes. They might at least consider how most Muslim students, American or otherwise, would respond to this nativist display; or better, Muslims and others that live their lives under the threat of our planes, drones and soldiers.
The overwhelmingly white, privileged, Block-I students should be ashamed of their obnoxious, fake-macho, chicken-hawk chant, while poverty-drafted members of their cohort fight and die in illegal and immoral wars for the control of oil. University administrators need to eliminate from all events such “patriotic” observances, which in this country cannot be separated from implicit justifications for state-sponsored killing.
Mr. Green’s tirade is like a cornucopia of just about every liberal screed imaginable. America as imperialists? Yep. Ignorantly slamming our military’s demographics? Of course. Blood for oil? You betcha.
The irony of course is that it is Mr. Green that is politicizing the event, not these students. Not to mention the irony of calling for tolerance while blasting your colleague’s patriotism as “fake” and suggesting that American Muslim students are somehow less patriotic than their peers.
Elsewhere in the University of Illinois system, word came yesterday that retired University of Illinois at Chicago professor Bill Ayers was denied “emeritus” status in a unanimous vote of the Board of Trustees. This after Board Chairman Christopher Kennedy, son of the late Robert F. Kennedy, protested granting the title to a man who dedicated one of his books, in part, to his father’s assassin, Sirhan Sirhan. After playing host to a well-known terrorist like Bill Ayers and an administrator offended by displays of patriotism, it is understandable why so many Americans view academia as out-of-touch and fear for their children’s taxpayer-funded education.

"Margaret Sanger, seated behind desk (Photo: Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division, Margaret Sanger Collection [reproduction number, e.g. LC-USZ62-12345])

@DrPaulKengor

Paul Kengor is professor of political science at Grove City College. His latest book is ""A Pope and a President: John Paul II, Ronald Reagan, and the Extraordinary Untold Story of the 20th Century.""
Margaret Sanger is a saint in the feminist church. She is a charter member of the progressive hall of fame. Liberals revere this woman who preached “race improvement” and denounced what she called “human weeds”.
Hillary Clinton glows that she is “in awe of” Sanger. She said so in 2009 upon receiving Planned Parenthood’s “highest honor” that year: its coveted Margaret Sanger Award.
Likewise effusive was Nancy Pelosi when she proudly accepted the award in 2014.
Speaking to Planned Parenthood a year earlier, President Barack Obama, hailed the organization founded by this racial eugenicist committed to creating a “race of thoroughbreds” and purging America’s “race of degenerates.”
“Thank you, Planned Parenthood,” and “God bless you,” said Obama to a giddy crowd of ecstatic women. The president commended Planned Parenthood’s “extraordinary” and “remarkable work,” and told the women they do a “great, great job.”
The love by liberals for Planned Parenthood and its founder seems to know no bounds. A professor, blogging at the New York Times, has argued for placing Margaret’s mug on the $20 bill.
And alas, even the Smithsonian, America’s museum, boasts a handsome bust of Sanger in its stately National Portrait Gallery.
>>> To read more on this topic: 13 Things You Probably Don’t Know About Planned Parenthood Founder Margaret Sanger 
Margaret is there enshrined in the Smithsonian’s vaunted “Struggle for Justice” exhibit.
This brings me to my reason for writing here today: a group of angry African-American pastors are demanding the removal of Sanger’s bust from the Smithsonian.
The letter from Ministers Taking a Stand states:
“Perhaps the Gallery is unaware that Ms. Sanger supported black eugenics, a racist attitude toward black and other minority babies, an elitist attitude toward those she regarded as ‘the feeble minded;’ speaking at a rally of Ku Klux Klan women; and communications with Hitler sympathizers. Also the notorious ‘Negro Project,’ which sought to limit, if not eliminate black births, was her brainchild.”
The pastors quote an infamous December 1939 letter from Sanger to Dr. Clarence Gamble of the Eugenics Society, where, in the context of discussing the Negro Project, Sanger wrote: “We do not want word to get out that we want to exterminate the Negro population and the minister is the man who can straighten out the idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members.”
The succinct, powerful statement from the pastors adds: “Despite these well-documented facts of history, her bust sits proudly in your gallery as a hero of justice. The obvious incongruity is staggering!”
Amen to that.
Liberals must be baffled by this, confusedly scratching their heads.
This isn’t the esteemed Planned Parenthood foundress they learned to admire in their college classrooms.
Margaret Sanger, a racist? Huh? They never heard that in American History 101.
Where could these crazy charges possibly come from?
The answer is a myriad of authoritative sources. For starters, one might consult Sanger’s own words. On pages 366-367 of her 1938 autobiography, published by W.W. Norton, one of the leading New York publishing houses, she spoke warmly of her May 1926 speech to the women’s chapter of the KKK in Silverlake, New Jersey.
Sanger seemed eager to speak to the group. After getting off the train, she was escorted by car along windings roads to a literal barn hidden in the country. There, the undeterred Planned Parenthood matron waited patiently for nearly three hours while her white-hooded sisters engaged in their incendiary routine. She observed “figures parading with banners and illuminated crosses.
I waited another twenty minutes. It was warmer and I did not mind so much.” “Eventually,” recorded Sanger of the toasty atmosphere, “the lights were switched on, the audience seated itself, and I was escorted to the platform, was introduced, and began to speak.”
Sanger was tight-lipped regarding what she shared with the klanswomen at their rally, though apparently she was extremely successful and satisfied with herself:
“I believed I had accomplished my purpose. A dozen invitations to speak to similar groups were proffered. The conversation went on and on, and when we were finally through it was too late to return to New York…. It was nearly one before I reached Trenton, and I spent the night in a hotel.”
The Planned Parenthood founder’s KKK talk was a smash hit. Not only did it go very late, after a long wait, but it earned Sanger a dozen new invitations from the klan-sisters. The KKK was quite excited about the work of Planned Parenthood’s founder.
Thus, it hardly comes out-of-nowhere when a group of African-American pastors today asks the Smithsonian: “How can a person like Sanger, who found common cause with the racial agenda of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), be ranked among true champions of ‘justice?’”
Precisely.
Such words pierce the liberal heart like a dagger. As many conservatives have experienced, when you point out to liberals that Planned Parenthood aborts (by far) a disproportionate number of unborn African-American babies, they go wild with rage and name-calling. You’re apt to be reflexively called everything from a fascist to (hey, why not?) a racist.
For liberals, facing such a stark reality precipitates uncontrollable, irrational outbursts. You can get called every name in the liberal playbook for raising this one.
As we watch weekly the ghastly Planned Parenthood video expose released by the Center for Medical Progress, in which Sanger’s organization’s “medical personnel” nonchalantly discuss dissecting baby parts while gleefully sipping Chianti and nibbling a Caesar’s salad, bear in mind that most of these babies are African-American. Which among them might have been another Rosa Parks, Ben Carson, Martin Luther King Jr., Arthur Ashe, or even Barack Obama?
These African-American pastors know that. Indeed, they show that 70 percent of Planned Parenthood abortion clinics are located in minority neighborhoods. Thus, they’re undertaking their own expose. Their letter, they say, will be but one “in a series of actions we will be taking to expose the evil of honoring Margaret Sanger and Planned Parenthood.”
Again, amen to that.
If liberals genuinely care about justice, they should join these African-American pastors in seeking the removal Margaret Sanger’s bust from the “Struggle for Justice” exhibit at America’s preeminent museum.
This woman is not worthy of enshrinement.

"Pope John Paul II was struck four times by an attempted assassin's bullets on May 13, 1981. (Photo: Winston Vargas/Flickr)

Paul Kengor

@DrPaulKengor

Paul Kengor is professor of political science at Grove City College. His latest book is ""A Pope and a President: John Paul II, Ronald Reagan, and the Extraordinary Untold Story of the 20th Century.""
On May 16, 1985, President Ronald Reagan met with CIA Director William J. Casey in the Oval Office.
What did Reagan and Casey talk about? The official record doesn’t tell us.
I dug into all available materials at the Reagan Library and filed Freedom of Information Act requests for the release of records for April and May 1985—phone call transcripts, logs of phone calls made and received, letters, correspondence, memos between Reagan and Casey, and memos between Casey and other members of the Reagan administration.
I also requested, for those same two months, the release of any documents by the CIA, the National Security Council, and other groups of interest.
Nothing refers to the content of the Reagan-Casey conversation on May 16.
Reagan did mention the meeting in his private diary. In his entry for that day he wrote that “Bill Casey came in” to discuss a Washington Post story on the March car bombing in Beirut that killed more than 80 people.
But as published in “The Reagan Diaries,” the entry ends with a bracketed ellipsis (“[?.?.?.?]”), which reflects an omission in the cleared and approved published account. In other words, here we run into another redaction.
The editor of “The Reagan Diaries,” the historian Douglas Brinkley, writes in his introduction, “The National Security Council read all five diary volumes and redacted only about six pages of material for national security reasons.”
So Reagan’s account of this May 16, 1985, meeting with the CIA director appears to be one of the exceedingly rare instances when the National Security Council held back material “for national security reasons.”
What was happening at this time that could be so sensitive?

By May 1985, investigators looking into the shooting of Pope John Paul II were tightening the noose around the Bulgarian communist regime and Moscow (to whom the Bulgarians were dutiful stooges, as was well known in the international intelligence community). Claire Sterling and other journalists had already cast suspicion on the communists with their investigative reporting.
Italian prosecutors, meanwhile, had been painstakingly assembling a case. In November 1982 the Italians had arrested the Bulgarian Sergei Antonov, former station chief of the Balkan Air office in Rome, in connection with the assassination attempt.
Now, in the spring of 1985, Antonov and other accused conspirators were about to go on trial.
And the Soviets were coming unhinged. According to the Soviet propaganda sheet Izvestia, Western forces were carefully orchestrating “a conspiracy to conceal a conspiracy.”
This was “the crudest sort of provocation,” Moscow said, intended to “conceal the real culprits and organizers of the terrorist act against the Pope, divert suspicion from them, delude public opinion and keep the true criminals from being exposed and punished.”
And who were the true criminals? They were the “agents” of “international imperialism,” who resided within Washington’s Beltway.
Despite the accusations coming from Moscow, Casey didn’t meet with Reagan on May 16 to discuss a CIA cover-up of U.S. involvement in the pope’s shooting.
No, the truth was that Casey had undertaken his own, secret investigation into the assassination attempt. He had taken an active interest in the case years earlier and was not satisfied with the approach that careerists within the CIA took to the investigation: They tended to dismiss out of hand any suggestion that the Soviet Bloc might have been involved.
The published reports by Sterling, a journalist he respected, had stirred the CIA director to investigate the assassination attempt further.
And now, in the spring of 1985, Casey was ready to report the findings to his president.
Rational observers have long suspected that the Soviets were behind the shooting of John Paul II. What has not been known—until this book—is that Reagan’s CIA director ordered this extremely sensitive CIA investigation or that the resulting report concluded that Moscow was in fact complicit in the plot to kill the pope.
More specifically, the CIA report concluded that the GRU—Soviet military intelligence—had ordered the assassination.
Through a series of interviews with various sources over the past decade, combined with a thorough search of the documentary record (especially through Freedom of Information Act requests and archival research), I have pieced together how the CIA’s extraordinarily secret investigation came about and what it found.
>>> Purchase Paul Kengor’s book, “A Pope and a President: John Paul II, Ronald Reagan, and the Extraordinary Untold Story of the 20th Century”
One source with knowledge of the CIA report told me, “I’ve never, ever, in all my years, seen anything as secretive as that document.”
Speaking of those privileged few who had seen it, most of whom are now deceased, the source added jokingly, “This was so classified that they nearly shot the secretary who typed it.” Few reports, if any, have been so thoroughly kept from view.
The source added, “The document that I’m referring to answers the question [of who planned the shooting of the pope].”
And what was the answer? As one of the few people who ever saw the report put it to me, the findings can be summarized simply: “The Russians did it.”
The information was so explosive that the report and its dramatic conclusion have never been released or even acknowledged. To this day, it remains the most secret report of the Cold War.
Keep in mind the context: Tensions in the Cold War had never run higher. The Soviets had been on the advance in the 1970s, but now Reagan and his partner in the Vatican were standing up to the threat of Soviet communism.
The 1980s intensified fears of World War III between two nuclear-armed superpowers. Now imagine if news broke that the U.S. government had discovered a Soviet-orchestrated assassination attempt on the leader of the world’s largest religion, who was a voice for those suffering under Soviet communism.
“That report exists,” I have been assured. “If someone can find it, you’ve got the most explosive report of the 20th century.”
I have searched tirelessly for the report, examining numerous archives and pursuing many other avenues. I have not found the document, but I know its conclusion, based on eyewitness accounts that high-level sources gave me.
I hope my book, “A Pope and a President,” compels action that leads to the release of the report. The evidence is clear: The Soviet GRU ordered the attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II.
It’s finally time to declassify this report and any other documents related to the papal assassination attempt, so we can know precisely what happened in what has rightly been called the “crime of the century.”

Democratic Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar on Thursday called for the U.S. government to cease detaining illegal immigrants.
Omar tweeted an ABC News story about a tiny Georgia town having more detained illegal immigrants than residents. Her takeaway: America shouldn’t be detaining those who cross the border illegally.
“This should never be the case,” she wrote. “The cruelty of our immigration system becomes clearer every day. We must stop detaining immigrants and start giving them pathways to citizenship.”

Omar’s tweet Thursday wasn’t the first time she’s stated her opposition to detaining foreign nationals who illegally cross America’s borders.
“We need to abolish ICE and end all inhumane detention and deportation programs. We need to fight back against the criminalization of immigrants,” she said in May 2019.
“It’s un-American to criminalize immigrants for wanting to come to this country for a better life. This is why ICE needs to be defunded,” she wrote in a June 2019 tweet.

"“Boys and men will not be able to take the place of girls and women in sports because it’s not fair. We cannot physically compete against boys and men,” Idaho state Rep. Barbara Ehardt says. (Photo: 
Trevor Williams/Getty Images)
An Idaho state legislator plans to introduce a bill that would require biologically male athletes to compete on boys sports teams, regardless of whether they identify as a transgender girl or not.
Idaho state Rep. Barbara Ehardt is the latest Republican lawmaker across the country to introduce legislation ensuring girls aren’t forced to compete against biologically male athletes.
The wave of proposed legislation comes as biological males have piled up victories in female athletics.
“Boys and men will not be able to take the place of girls and women in sports because it’s not fair. We cannot physically compete against boys and men,” Ehardt told East Idaho News on Monday.
“The inherent biological, scientific advantages that boys and men have over girls and women, even if they were to take hormones, even if they were to spend a couple of years on estrogen, that’s not going to replace the inherent biological advantages that boys and men have,” she added.
Ehardt’s view is backed up by scientific research on the subject, which shows that biologically male athletes who identify as transgender retain physiological advantages over female athletes, even after undergoing hormone therapy.
Biological males who identify as transgender have excelled in female athletics. Two biologically male runners in Connecticut have dominated girls high school track in the liberal state, which allows athletes to compete as the gender with which they identify.
Franklin Pierce University runner CeCe Telfer, a biological male who identifies as a transgender woman, won an NCAA Division II national championship in women’s track and field last May. Telfer told ESPN in June that female runners are actually the ones with an advantage.
A biologically male runner at the University of Montana, a Division I NCAA school, was named the Big Sky Conference’s cross-country female athlete of the week in October.
Ehardt’s forthcoming bill follows similar legislation from Republican state legislators around the country. Alabama state Rep. Rep. Chris Pringle, for example, authored the Gender is Real Legislative (GIRL) Act, which he announced earlier this month.
Other bills meant to protect female athletes from being forced to compete against biological males are in the works in New Hampshire, Washington, Georgia, Tennessee, and Missouri, The Wall Street Journal previously reported.

"“I do think there is a legitimate concern about women’s lived experience and the importance of recognizing that, and also the importance of recognizing the self-identification [of people who identify as transgender],” former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton says. Pictured: Clinton speaks at the 18th annual Vital Voices Global Leadership Awards April 24, 2019, in Washington, D.C. (Photo: 
Paul Morigi/Getty Images)
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in an interview that transgender issues raise a “legitimate concern” for women.
Clinton appeared on BBC Radio4 with her daughter Chelsea Clinton on Tuesday to promote their book “The Book of Gutsy Women: Favorite Stories of Courage and Resilience.” They differed in their answers when asked about the subject of biological males who identify as transgender. Chelsea Clinton defended the idea that those men can become women, while her mother struck a more cautionary note.
“I do think there is a legitimate concern about women’s lived experience and the importance of recognizing that, and also the importance of recognizing the self-identification [of people who identify as transgender],” Hillary Clinton said. “This is all relatively new. People are still trying to find the language for it, trying to sort it out. I think in the right mindset this can be understood, but it’s going to take some time.”
It wasn’t the first time the former secretary of state has shown hesitance on transgender issues. She expressed skepticism when asked last month if a man with a beard and a penis could be a woman, calling it a “very big generational discussion.”
“If Hillary Clinton’s words on transgender issues in October were off-the-cuff and spontaneous, her words to the BBC today were not,” British writer James Kirkup argued in The Spectator magazine. “She’s chosen to state clearly that there are indeed ‘legitimate concerns’ about the way transgender issues relate to women and their lives,” he added.
Clinton on Tuesday also declined to rule out running for president a third time in 2020. “As I say, ‘Never, never, never say never,’” she said in another BBC interview. “I will certainly tell you, I’m under enormous pressure from many, many, many people to think about it. But as of this moment, sitting here in this studio talking to you, that is absolutely not in my plans.”
Every Democratic presidential frontrunner supports a bill that would force schools to include male athletes who identify as transgender girls on female sports teams.

Biologically male cyclist Rachel McKinnon won a women’s world championship Saturday.
McKinnon, representing Canada, won gold for the sprint event in the women’s 35-39 age category at the 2019 Masters Track Cycling World Championships in Manchester, England.
McKinnon set a women’s world record in the qualifying event, the BBC reported. McKinnon, a philosophy professor at the College of Charleston, won the same event in 2018.
McKinnon told Sky News in an interview that aired Friday that it would be unfair if the cyclist was kept out of women’s events.
“So, if we want to say, that I believe you’re a woman for all of society, except for this massive central part that is sport, then that’s not fair,” McKinnon said.
McKinnon said in a tweet Sunday that a “real champion” would accept biologically male athletes competing in female athletics.
“I have yet to meet a real champion who has a problem with trans women. Real champions want stronger competition,” McKinnon wrote. “If you win because bigotry got your competition banned … you’re a loser.”
I have yet to meet a real champion who has a problem with trans women.Real champions want stronger competition. If you win because bigotry got your competition banned… you're a loser.
In another tweet late Saturday night, McKinnon argued that “ignorant” people oppose allowing biologically male athletes in female sports.
“The thing is, the people who oppose trans women’s full and equal rights think that the ‘facts’ are on their side,” McKinnon wrote. “This is why they always come back to ‘common sense.’ That’s not an argument, loves. It’s the last refuge of the ignorant. It means you’ve already lost, bad,” added McKinnon, who did not return an email seeking comment.
The thing is, the people who oppose trans women's full and equal rights think that the 'facts' are on their side.This is why they always come back to ""common sense.""That's not an argument, loves. It's the last refuge of the ignorant. It means you've already lost, bad.
McKinnon is an example of biologically male athletes racking up victories in female athletics.
Two biologically male runners have dominated girls’ high school track in Connecticut, which allows self-identified transgender athletes to compete as the opposite sex.
At the NCAA level, a biologically male runner who identifies as transgender won an NCAA women’s track championship in May after previously competing on the university’s men’s team.

"A recent New York law makes it possible to apply for a driver’s license without a Social Security number, and makes foreign documentation valid for the purpose of obtaining a license. (Photo: fotog/Getty Images)
The Department of Homeland Security rebuked a New York law that took effect Monday allowing illegal aliens to obtain driver’s licenses.
The state’s “Green Light” bill, which Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed in June, makes it possible to apply for a driver’s license without a Social Security number, and makes foreign documentation valid for the purpose of obtaining a license.
“This will protect criminals at the expense of the safety and security of law-abiding New York residents,” a DHS spokesman said in a statement Monday evening.
“Besides giving drivers licenses to hundreds of thousands of people who broke our laws and have come to our country illegally, the New York law also blocks DHS law enforcement officers who investigate crimes like child exploitation, human trafficking, terrorism, the targeting of gang members, sex offenders, and drug smuggling, from accessing important public records,” added the spokesman.
“Accessing this information is vital to building out these criminal cases, identifying criminal suspects, and enhancing officer safety,” the statement continued.
A spokeswoman for the New York Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) confirmed that the state won’t share data with ICE under the new law.
“Under the Green Light Law, no DMV data of any kind can be shared with an agency that primarily enforces immigration law, which means ICE, Customs & Border Protection and Citizenship and Immigration Services do not have access to data unless the DMV is presented with a valid judge-signed court order, subpoena or judicial warrant,” NYS DMV Assistant Commissioner for Communications Lisa Koumjian told The Daily Caller News Foundation.
The “Green Light” bill has drawn resistance from county clerks, some of whom have vowed not to comply with the mandate to grant driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants. Some clerks have said they’re even required to accept foreign report cards as valid forms of identification.
“I’m now going to have to accept a report card from a foreign country and foreign documentation, a foreign passport as authenticated documents. I, myself, as the clerk am going to have to do that,” Erie County Clerk Michael Kearns, a Democrat, told “Fox & Friends” on Saturday. “So they have diminished a New York state driver’s license and we’re very concerned for our safety and security because western New York is a border to Canada.”

"Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., says President Donald Trump killed Iranian military leader Qasem Soleimani as a “distraction” from domestic political issues.

Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., accused President Donald Trump of killing Iranian military leader Qasem Soleimani—a designated terrorist by the U.S. government—as a “distraction” from domestic political issues.
Other left-of-center Trump critics echoed Omar’s accusation that Trump authorized the strike on Soleimani as a “distraction.”
“It’s highly possible then timing of tonight’s attack was meant as a distraction,” MSNBC contributor Joyce Alene wrote on Twitter, adding, “Trump wants to distract you” from the impeachment issue.
So what if Trump wants war, knows this leads to war and needs the distraction?Real question is, will those with congressional authority step in and stop him? I know I will. https://t.co/Fj9TMossEW
Why did Trump kill Soleimani now? Preventive strike? Election strategy? Impeachment distraction? I vote: ego https://t.co/lfDlf3234L
“Given that US response to the attack that killed an American contractor was so disproportionate and predictably provocative, today’s air strike feels like attempt to create a distraction from Impeachment and build support for Trump,” CNN commentator Karen Finney tweeted.
“You have to wonder if Friday’s jobs report is so bad that it caused Trump to launch attack on Iran’s Soleimani to distract?” CNN and Daily Beast columnist Dean Obeidallah wrote.
“I’m not saying he’s starting a war to distract, I’m only saying he’s EXACTLY the kind of monster who would,” wrote liberal author Mikel Jollett.
Let’s be absolutely clear on this: Trump ordered the assassination of Qasem Solemani to start a war with Iran and distract from his heinous undermining of our Constitution. This is a blatant attempt to further subvert the democratic process, no matter the cost to our military. https://t.co/8G8xVBRoj6
It may be a distraction from impeachment for a time but the price in blood will be high. It’s that price I worry that Trump hasn’t thought through. https://t.co/lSUk7SsY9I
“Trump is starting his own war to distract from his own Impeachment. It’s the most obvious move and we all saw this coming,” United Nations Environment Goodwill Ambassador Aidan Gallagher tweeted.

"The New York Times recently described monogamy as “a curious stalwart” and noted that more and more young people reject its “blandness.” (Photo: Stock/Getty Images)
Major media outlets appear to be normalizing non-monogamous relationships.
CBSN, the digital streaming arm of CBS News, provided the latest example with an hourlong special on “consensual non-monogamy” that aired Sunday night. It included a 22-minute documentary that centered around interviews with people in openly non-monogamous relationships.
Interviews with a pro-polyamory researcher and a pro-polyamory lawyer followed the documentary.
“The way our parents were brought up, monogamy felt like it was necessary. It was just the way culture accepted you, it is the way everybody accepted you. Now, things are different, things are opening, up,” a man identified as Alex, who is in an open marriage with his wife of one year, told CBSN. 
Alex and his wife, Bridget, both have outside partners that they date and sleep with, they said.
CBS also interviewed C.J., Brandi, and Brooke, who are a husband, wife, and shared third partner describing themselves as in a “triad monogamous relationship,” though their arrangement is by definition not monogamous. 
Brandi said that “with three people it makes it a little bit easier to get those [sexual] needs fulfilled,” explaining that sometimes she’ll have sex with C.J. but not Brooke, or vice versa.
Another man interviewed by CBSN, called Mahdi, is in a “triad” with two women.
“I had to divorce my first partner because my second partner had immigration status issues,” Mahdi said, noting that he was still in a relationship with both of them. He added that he doesn’t think he has had health insurance since he divorced his first wife.
“For years, monogamy has dominated what society perceives as, and allows to be, ‘normal,’ but in the modern era, those parameters are softening,” an Oct. 25 press release from CBS said ahead of the program’s airing. 
CBS also teased the special with articles and video clips that portrayed non-monogamous relationships in a sympathetic light.
Legal hurdles in non-monogamous relationships https://t.co/bAp0Uht1r0 pic.twitter.com/4vlnterCuL
The Daily Beast’s coverage of the documentary said it “dismantles the stereotype that non-monogamy is synonymous with adultery or a wild orgy.”
CBS is just the latest major media company to promote polyamory. 
“People are becoming more curious about consensual non-monogamy,” The New York Times reported in an Oct. 2 article on marriages involving members of polyamorous relationships. 
The Times in August published a feature piece titled “Polyamory Works for Them,” describing monogamy as “a curious stalwart” and that more and more young people are rejecting its “blandness.”
ABC News delved into actor Nico Tortorella’s polyamorous lifestyle in an Oct. 24 article that said the actor’s open marriage is “redefining what it means to be ‘husband and wife.’”

"Lawyers for Anita Green filed suit against a beauty pageant organization at a federal court in Oregon, alleging the organization unlawfully discriminated against Green by limiting the competition to “natural born females.” (Photo: 
leykladay/Getty Images)
A biological male who identifies as a transgender woman is suing after being denied entry into a female beauty pageant in Oregon.
Lawyers for Anita Green filed suit Tuesday against United States of America Pageants in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon, alleging the organization unlawfully discriminated against Green by limiting the competition to “natural born females,” according to court documents reviewed by The Daily Caller News Foundation.
Green’s lawyers contended the requirement that contestants be “natural born females” was “an express discriminatory eligibility policy,” arguing the requirement was “intentionally designed” to exclude biological males who identify as transgender women.
Green’s lawyers argued the requirement “is discriminatory because it denied [Green] the full and equal advantages and privileges of defendant’s services in violation of Oregon’s public accommodations law.”
The court issued a summons Thursday giving the pageant organization 21 days to issue a response to Green’s complaint. Neither Green’s lawyer nor United States of America Pageants returned The Daily Caller News Foundation’s requests for comment.
“I felt as though I was being invalidated. I felt as though the organization was saying I am not a woman and I’m not woman enough,” Green told Willamette Week. “This is about justice and it’s about righting a wrong. No matter what anyone thinks about pageants, trans women should have the choice to compete just like anyone else.”
Green isn’t the only biological male seeking to enter female competitions.
June Eastwood, a biologically male NCAA runner at the University of Montana, was named the Big Sky Conference’s female athlete of the week in October. Biologically male cyclist Rachel McKinnon won a women’s world championship and set a world record that same month.
Franklin Pierce University runner CeCe Telfer, a biological male who identifies as a transgender woman, won an NCAA Division II women’s track and field championship in May. Telfer competed on the men’s team before switching to women’s events.
Two biologically male runners, both of whom identify as transgender girls, have dominated girls high school track in Connecticut.

"NCAA policy is that male athletes who identify as transgender can compete on women’s teams if they suppress their testosterone levels for a full calendar year. (Photo: 	Paul Bradbury/Getty Images)
A top-ranked runner in NCAA women’s track is dominating the competition and setting records one year after competing as a man at the same level.
Franklin Pierce University senior CeCe Telfer leads the NCAA’s Division II women’s division in the 55-meter dash and 55-meter hurdle events. Telfer led Franklin Pierce’s women’s track team into the top 25 rankings for the first time in program’s history, local newspaper The Keene Sentinel reported in December. The New Hampshire college is ranked 14th in DII.
“Senior CeCe Telfer (Lebanon, N.H.) won three Northeast-10 Conference titles on Sunday, to lead the Franklin Pierce University women’s track & field team and earn Most Outstanding Track Athlete honors at the NE10 Championships, hosted by American International College, on the campus of Smith College,” reads a Feb. 17 article the school’s athletic department posted.
Telfer broke the conference finals record at the meet and qualified for three different events at March’s NCAA championships, the article noted.
Telfer is one of the fastest runners in NCAA women’s track and field at any division—not just at the DII level. Telfer’s best time in the 55-meter dash is tied with the third-fastest runner at the women’s DI level.
Telfer previously ran a variety of events for Franklin Pierce’s men’s team, during most of which time he went by the first name Craig, according to school records.
Telfer competed on Franklin Pierce’s men’s team as recently as January 2018, according to published meet results from the Middlebury Winter Classic in Vermont. By that point Telfer had started using the name CeCe, while still competing on the men’s team.
NCAA policy is that male athletes who identify as transgender can compete on women’s teams if they suppress their testosterone levels for a full calendar year. Otherwise, so-called mixed teams—which have both males and females—can compete in the men’s division, but not in the women’s division, according to NCAA rules.
The NCAA in 2011 published an explainer calling it “not well founded” to assume “that being born with a male body automatically gives a transgender woman an unfair advantage when competing against non-transgender women.”
“Transgender women display a great deal of physical variation, just as there is a great deal of natural variation in physical size and ability among non-transgender women and men. Many people may have a stereotype that all transgender women are unusually tall and have large bones and muscles. But that is not true,” the explainer states.
“A male-to-female transgender woman may be small and slight, even if she is not on hormone blockers or taking estrogen. It is important not to overgeneralize. The assumption that all male-bodied people are taller, stronger, and more highly skilled in a sport than all female-bodied people is not accurate,” it continues.
Telfer’s success in the women’s division, which was first highlighted by sports blog Turtleboy Sports, is the latest example of biological males who identify as transgender women piling up victories in women’s sports.
Two biologically male high schoolers in Connecticut, Terry Miller and Andraya Yearwood, are dominating girls track in the state. The two teens are among the fastest high school sprinters in the country—though only in the girls division.
One of Miller’s and Yearwood’s female competitors, fellow junior Selina Soule, told the Associated Press that it was unfair to force female high schoolers to compete against male athletes.
“We all know the outcome of the race before it even starts; it’s demoralizing,” Soule said. “I fully support and am happy for these athletes for being true to themselves. They should have the right to express themselves in school, but athletics have always had extra rules to keep the competition fair,” she added.
One of the top scorers for Australia’s women’s handball team is Hannah Mouncey, who played for the Australian men’s handball team before transitioning. Mouncey played women’s Australian rules football between transitioning and switching to women’s handball.
Mouncey was banned from the women’s division of the Australian Football League’s women’s division in October 2017 before receiving approval to play in February 2018.
Rachel McKinnon, a biologically male college professor who identifies as a transgender woman, won a women’s cycling world championship in October. McKinnon won the women’s sprint 35-39 age bracket at the 2018 UCI Masters Track Cycling World Championships in Los Angeles.
McKinnon in January 2018 was quoted in USA Today arguing against requiring biological males to suppress testosterone as a requirement for competing against women.
“We cannot have a woman legally recognized as a trans woman in society, and not be recognized that way in sports,” McKinnon told USA Today. “Focusing on performance advantage is largely irrelevant because this is a rights issue. We shouldn’t be worried about trans people taking over the Olympics. We should be worried about their fairness and human rights instead.”
Democratic Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar called for an investigation into USA Powerlifting in January after the athletic association announced that male lifters who identify as transgender women aren’t allowed to compete as women.
Omar called it a “myth” that men who identify as transgender women have a “direct competitive advantage” in a Jan. 31 letter she sent to USA Powerlifting on behalf of Jaycee Cooper, a male powerlifter in Omar’s district who identifies as a transgender woman.
Omar copied Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison on the letter, “with a recommendation that he investigate this discriminatory behavior.”
Ellison said his office didn’t have the jurisdiction to investigate USA Powerlifting, but recommended that Cooper “file a complaint with the Minnesota Department of Human Rights.”

A biological male who identifies as a transgender woman won an NCAA national championship over Memorial Day weekend.
Franklin Pierce University runner CeCe Telfer won the Division II women’s 400-meter hurdles on Saturday night, besting the second-place finisher by more than a second.
“Telfer is the first student-athlete in Franklin Pierce history to collect an individual national title,” the university announced.
“It was tough conditions out here with the wind and the heat over the last three days but, as she has over the last six months, CeCe proved herself to be tough enough to handle it,” FPU coach Zach Emerson said in a press release.
“Today was a microcosm of her entire season; she was not going to let anything slow her down. I’ve never met anybody as strong as her mentally in my entire life,” Emerson said.
Telfer’s victory came less than two hours after taking fifth place in the 100-meter hurdles. OutSports, a pro-LGBT sports website, touted Telfer as “a trans athlete who doesn’t win every time.”
Telfer previously ran a variety of events for Franklin Pierce’s men’s team, during most of which time he went by the first name Craig, according to school records. 
Telfer competed on FPU’s men’s track team as recently as January 2018, according to published meet results from the Middlebury Winter Classic in Vermont. Telfer had started using the name CeCe at that point, while still competing on the men’s team.
NCAA policy is that male athletes who identify as transgender can compete on women’s teams if they suppress their testosterone levels for a full calendar year.

Telfer’s victory is just the latest instance of male athletes who identify as transgender entering—and then winning—female athletic events.
Two male runners have dominated girls high school track in Connecticut, which a female competitor described as “demoralizing.”
Rachel McKinnon, a biological male who identifies as transgender, won a women’s world championship cycling event in October.

Two male runners are continuing to dominate high school girls track in Connecticut.
High school juniors Terry Miller and Andraya Yearwood took first and second place in the state open indoor track championships Feb. 16, The Associated Press noted in a report Sunday. Both Miller and Yearwood are biological males who identify as transgender girls.
One of their competitors, high school junior Selina Soule, told The Associated Press it was unfair to force female runners to compete against male runners.
“We all know the outcome of the race before it even starts; it’s demoralizing,” said Soule. “I fully support and am happy for these athletes for being true to themselves. They should have the right to express themselves in school, but athletics have always had extra rules to keep the competition fair.”
Miller is the third-fastest runner in the country in the girls’ 55-meter dash. Yearwood is close behind, tied for seventh nationally.
Miller and Yearwood’s success is just the latest instance of male athletes who identify as transgenderexcelling in women’s sports.
Miller and Yearwood easily outpaced female runners in the state in 2018 as well, when both were sophomores.
A sympathetic segment on ABC’s “Good Morning America” in June 2018 described the two runners as “dominating the competition” at the outdoor state championships earlier that month.
In that interview, Miller argued that female runners should work harder, rather than complaining about unfairness, when forced to compete against male athletes who identify as transgender.
Yearwood acknowledged being stronger than female runners to The Associated Press, but compared it to advantages other athletes might have from perfecting their form or doing extra training sessions.
“One high jumper could be taller and have longer legs than another, but the other could have perfect form, and then do better,” Yearwood told The Associated Press. “One sprinter could have parents who spend so much money on personal training for their child, which in turn, would cause that child to run faster.”

"Dr. Bruce Latham, a family practitioner in Coos County, New Hampshire, says he reports to law enforcement anybody he suspects of selling drugs, including prescription painkillers. (Photo: Josh Siegel/The Daily Signal)

COLEBROOK, N.H.—Bruce Latham, a lanky, self-employed doctor, occupies a unique position in the depths of rural New Hampshire’s opioid drug addiction crisis.
As part of his practice in Colebrook, a town of 2,300 in Coos County, Latham responds to pain by prescribing opioid painkillers. He says he empathizes with patients’ propensity to become addicted to pain medicine because his own son is a recovering drug addict.
“I don’t judge these kids because I understand addiction and understand what dopamine does to your brain,” Latham says, describing how opioids target the brain’s reward system by releasing dopamine, a chemical that regulates feelings of pleasure.

Part 4 of 5: Police Assault on Opioids Gets Boost From a Family Doctor 
Latham, 63, is also ruthlessly committed to stamping out the illegal use—and spread of—opiates as they decimate Coos County, which has the highest combined death rate due to drugs, alcohol, or suicide in all of New England.
On a recent April afternoon, Latham, a measured, religious man with heavy bags under his eyes, is downright gleeful as he unveils a wad of note cards, bound with a rubber band. Embellishing, the physician says these cards contain the identities of “every opioid drug dealer within 100 miles of Colebrook.”
For the past 10 years, Latham has reported to law enforcement anybody he comes into contact with or knows about who he suspects to have sold or otherwise illicitly misused drugs, including prescription painkillers.
Some of these people are his patients, he says, and others are individuals who patients notified him about.
“The cards are kind of like a monument to say maybe we are doing something—maybe we are stopping some of this,” Latham says, slapping the stack of note cards against his lap to reflect the urgency of this region’s opioid addiction epidemic. “I am a good Mormon kid. I just don’t like to see people who have problems taken advantage of.”

Latham’s dual role—prescribing pain medicine and helping to secure punishment for those who he suspects don’t use it properly—is unusual in Coos County, the poorest, most northern, and least populated of New Hampshire’s 10 counties.
His position is also informal, although Latham doesn’t hide his cooperation with law enforcement.
Latham’s office, which looks like a house and is decorated as a private residence, with framed images of Jesus hanging from the walls, is located down the road from the Colebrook Police Department—the agency he principally works with.
Patients who receive prescription pain medicine from Latham must sign an agreement that plainly authorizes the doctor to “cooperate” with law enforcement and waives the normally sacred right of confidentiality for patients.

Latham says he will stop serving a patient if he suspects he or she is not handling medication responsibly—by using a higher dose than prescribed, selling the drugs, or diverting them to family and friends.
“My patients sign a drug agreement,” says Latham, who notes that about 20 of his 2,000 patients are on chronic pain medication. “If you sell, I turn you into the police. I can’t have one person destroy the program.”
Latham says patients who are misusing drugs, or know of others who do, are eager to share information because he isn’t a law enforcement official.
“The kids know what is happening,” Latham says, adding:
They will give me a name and tell me how much the heroin is going for. They just volunteer it. A lot of these kids have been in trouble with the law. It’s almost like they think, ‘I can’t go to the police with this because I had a problem one time.’ But they can trust me. This marriage between law enforcement [and] physicians has never been made. I am the only one doing this up here.
‘Need to Do Something’
While Latham’s actions may seem out of place, local law enforcement officials here—burdened by limited resources—welcome any form of help they can get.
Colebrook Police Chief Steve Cass jokes that this town, and others around it, are so small that he “pretty much knows everybody,” and if he doesn’t, “then I know somebody who does.”
Cass, 43, memorizes phone numbers—as he demonstrates to a reporter who tests him—and can recite most residents’ first and last names just by looking at them.
“I am a nut like that,” says Cass, who was born in Coos and intends to remain here because he loves living in a rural area where he can “step out on the back porch in my drawers and shoot my shotgun off.”

The chief says his agency is the only full-time police department in the area. Many of Coos County’s towns are unincorporated, and don’t have police departments.
The Coos County Sheriff’s Office, meanwhile, doesn’t handle criminal cases and focuses on civil services such as transporting inmates to various correctional facilities and providing security in state and federal courts.
Cass says he uses information provided by Latham just like any other tip he might receive, as a supplement to tactics the police department uses to combat drug crime, including enlisting confidential informants and doing undercover drug buys.
“I am willing to listen to anybody who wants to provide information,” Cass tells The Daily Signal in an interview, adding:
I’ve been around here long enough to know if someone wants to talk to me, I am going to listen. While Bruce [Latham] definitely has a finger on the pulse of the region, what he tells me is like anything you hear on the street about someone who is dealing pills or a narcotic. I have to make a case. I can’t just take what you say and go and do a search warrant. The information in itself doesn’t mean you can take down somebody.
Cass says Latham isn’t employed by, nor does he have any formal relationship with, the police department. The partnership has limits—the department does not share information with Latham about active investigations.

Latham says he first offered assistance to the police department about 10 years ago in response to a rash of opioid overdose deaths. Latham, who is originally from New Jersey, had just moved to northern New Hampshire to respond to a need for physicians.
“I remember the chief saying, ‘You see the smile on my face? You are the first doctor ever to walk into my office and be willing to help us.’ I said, ‘Chief, we have a major problem in this town. Every year we are losing 10 kids from drug overdoses. We need to do something. We have to work as a team on this.’”
In the view of Cass and Latham, if they could reduce illegal sources of drugs from the streets, there would be fewer drugs for people to become addicted to—and potentially die from.
“You don’t know all the things you prevented, but if you save one life it’s worth it to me,” Cass says.
‘Very Bad Information’
But still, some in the medical community question whether it’s proper—or effective—for a physician to take an aggressive approach in working with police.
Before Latham started his own practice in Colebrook in 2007, he was employed by the Indian Stream Health Center, the largest medical provider in Coos County.

Part 4: Police Assault on Opioids Gets Boost From a Family Doctor 
Part 5: The First Responders Who Witness a Dreadful Toll
John Fothergill, a physician there who is also a state representative, hired Latham. He spent about a year at Indian Stream, the county’s leading prescriber of pain medication.
Fothergill says patients often report to him potential misuse of opioids he prescribed to others, but he treats these claims skeptically.
“The problem we have at the health center is the information we get from the public is very bad information in general,” Fothergill tells The Daily Signal in an interview. “Frequently, if person A won’t sell drugs to person B, person B may call the health center and say person A is selling drugs—just because he’s mad at him.”
Fothergill, 62, says opioid users who become addicts learn to lie to feed their addiction, and physicians aren’t in a position to determine the truth.
“I have had patients in the past say one thing, and then they have a come-to-Jesus moment and say, ‘I was lying,’” Fothergill says. “I don’t take much of it to heart—or at least I don’t take much of it to the police. A lot of these people certainly have problems. They are addicted to drugs, and to expect them to behave like honest citizens is somewhat unrealistic.”
Indian Stream works with law enforcement only in limited circumstances, Fothergill says, in situations where medical staff suspects easier-to-prove illegal activity, such as when a patient tampers with a urine sample during a drug test in order to be prescribed more medication.
“We certainly have a relationship with law enforcement,” Fothergill says. “They talk to us. We talk to them.”

Fothergill argues that it is wrong for medical providers to apply their own zero-tolerance policy to opioids misuse, because addiction—which can drive illegal activity—is best addressed through treatment.
Indian Stream requires patients who receive prescription pain medicine for 28 days or longer to participate in a substance abuse class or group therapy.
“People have to fail multiple times before we say we are really not helping you, you need to go some place else,” Fothergill says. “In our program, we expect them to be honest, but we try to provide increased help instead of just throwing them out.”
‘Sticky Thing’
John McCormick, Coos County’s attorney and chief law enforcement officer, appreciates the challenges in approaching a drug epidemic fueled by both legal and illegal behavior.
McCormick, who has a soft voice and cerebral demeanor, is contemplative as he discusses the circumstances in which he believes drug-related crime should be met with punishment rather than second chances.

Reflecting on the nuances of his job, he reveals to a reporter the number of drug overdose deaths in Coos reported to him in recent years—12 in 2015, nine in 2016, a few likely already this year, although it’s too early to know for sure.
“To beat this, I think it’s got to be sort of a multipronged approach,” McCormick tells The Daily Signal, sitting on a broken desk chair in his undecorated office. He adds:
I can tell you that some folks I have seen through the criminal justice system, I almost want to say they are almost in a better place in jail than outside of jail. I have seen addiction cases where if you let this person free, they are going to die. It’s that bad.

The county attorney, who has been in his position for nearly five years, adds that he has seen defendants die of a drug overdose before they go to trial for a drug-related case.
“We are not here to just throw everyone in jail,” McCormick says. “I don’t think we can just prosecute our way out of this. Treatment is worth a try. If they are not ready to receive that help or are not accepting it, the other alternative is jail.”
At the federal level, Attorney General Jeff Sessions has signaled a tougher approach to drug crime, recently ordering federal prosecutors to charge suspects with the most serious offense they can prove. But, McCormick says, it’s important to see each case for its unique characteristics.

McCormick says he usually reserves the most severe charges for suspects selling large quantities of drugs and for out-of-towners who travel to Coos County to sell drugs—usually from the Boston area—to take advantage of the demand. Repeat offenders also deserve stronger punishment, he says:
It’s kind of a sticky thing. I am aware of the addiction aspect, of course. I think I differentiate between someone who sells to use, and someone who sells just to profit; however, those lines are blurred. Every defense attorney will say their client is dealing to use.
McCormick, who knows Latham but doesn’t work directly with the doctor, says it’s challenging even for law enforcement to confirm the intent behind suspected illegal activity related to drugs.
“In these kind of cases, credibility is king,” McCormick says. “Sometimes you have to take what folks say with a grain of salt. Certainly, if they are serious addicts, we want to make them rehabilitate. At the same time, sometimes they know how to tell a good lie and manipulate folks in order to keep using. It’s a tough thing. We aren’t human lie detectors. It’s hard to sometimes tell whether someone is genuine.”
‘There Is Hope’
Seeking the proper balance between punishment and treatment, McCormick, Cass, and Latham all sound hopeful about a potential solution.
Coos County, working with the state, is in the process of creating a drug court.
In such a specialty court for offenders with substance abuse problems, defendants are able to access treatment services as an alternative to incarceration.
As the defendant receives treatment, he or she checks in periodically with the court, which closely monitors progress and can impose sanctions if the offender commits a new crime.
In August, McCormick is planning to travel to Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, a small, rural community, to observe how it runs its drug court.
With state funding committed, McCormick says he expects a drug court to come online in Coos County within a year.

He is careful not to portray a drug court as a panacea to the opioid crisis, however:
The idea is you get a little more supervision and oversight. I am cautiously optimistic it may have an impact and help at least some of the folks who are dependent on substances to steer away from illegal activity. I don’t want to say it’s not a solution. I don’t know if it will be a solution. But it can’t hurt.
Latham, the physician, says a drug court could achieve the difficult balance of providing an opportunity for people to better themselves, while also imposing consequences for those who continue to violate the law.
“My son was a heroin addict and has pretty much turned his life around,” Latham says of his only son, Chris, who was 15 when he started using drugs and is now in his 30s, married, and the father of a daughter.
“I am proud of the boy,” Latham says. “So I would say there is hope. It’s like that saying, you can’t change the spots on a leopard. I don’t treat leopards. I treat human beings, and they can change.”

"Montgomery County Police Department Chief Thomas Manger testifies in 2015 at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on U.S. immigration enforcement policies. (Photo: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters
/Newscom)
Two years ago, a suburban Maryland county began to see a dramatic rise in killings attributed to MS-13, an international gang with ties to Central America.
In response, the Montgomery County Police Department assigned Capt. Paul Liquorie, a 23-year veteran of the police force, to lead a centralized street gang unit dedicated to stomping out the violence.
In an interview with The Daily Signal, Liquorie, 49, director of the department’s Special Investigations Division, described law enforcement’s approach to combating MS-13 in this affluent county just outside Washington, D.C.
Since August 2015, Liquorie said, the county has suffered seven MS-13-related homicides.
“The Latino community where MS-13 has a presence is terrified,” Liquorie said.
The Trump administration repeatedly has invoked the threat of MS-13, making the gang a central focus of its effort to enforce immigration laws aggressively.
Liquorie, in a Q&A below, describes MS-13’s increasing “brutality and callousness” and how Montgomery County works with federal law enforcement to find and prosecute the gang’s members.
“Law enforcement won’t tolerate this,” Liquorie said of the violence and other crimes associated with MS-13.
The Daily Signal: How long has MS-13 been present in Montgomery County, and what’s different about their activity in the county now?
Liquorie: It always has been a priority because MS-13 has such a presence here in the county.
What we attribute to MS-13 is that since August of 2015, we’ve had seven MS-13-related homicides where we believe the perpetrators are MS-13 and two victims we believe were MS-13.
One of the things most alarming recently is the number of homicides, and the brutality and callousness by which they occur.
What I mean by that is the reasoning behind the violence may just be someone flashing a gang sign on the internet, or someone who may be believed to be a rival gang member.
The murders are not done in the sense of to gain greater territory or monetary benefits for the gang itself.
Another alarming thing is how [MS-13 leaders] try to get junior members to rise in status. To prove your loyalty in the gang, you will have to commit a homicide to get the full confidence of the gang in your abilities.
What we have seen regularly in recent years is just the brutality of the violence. People are lured into wooded areas, [and] usually stabbed with some sort of edged weapon multiple times.

The other thing we have seen change in recent years is they want anyone who is present to be actively involved in the violence.
Rather than one person stabbing the victim, and two others being there on the periphery, they want everybody to stab the body multiple times to say now we are all equally culpable and you will be less likely to snitch or make a deal with prosecutors because you were also involved.
You are just as culpable.
When someone is shot, there is a level of distance. To stab someone is a very personal act. You have to be up close to that person and be right with them as they are dying.
Q: How has the escalation in violence that you are describing been impacted by the flood of unaccompanied Central American youth who have settled in the area in recent years? Are those recent arrivals targeted for gang recruitment?
A: Even outside the gang, there is a different status [perceived] between these new arrivals, these unaccompanied minors, and established immigrants. That means these kids further become alienated.
They don’t fit in at school. Some of them might not fit in at home. They come here hopefully trying to flee violence in their country, so whoever is their sponsor here, those people, many may be struggling economically already and are taking on this additional economic burden of sponsoring someone else.
The gang can come to you and can fill these voids, and that makes [the new arrivals] very susceptible to be gang members.
We see a grooming process very similar to what you would see with pedofiles to gain people’s trust.
A lot of these kids are in over their heads before they know it.
Q: Are the victims of MS-13 violence randomly targeted? What traits characterize the victims?
A: In the vast majority of them, we have been very successful in prosecuting the perpetrator of these crimes, and we have some [cases] that still remain open, where we hear through our investigation that the victims may have had ties to MS-13.
There is usually some affiliation with the gang. They may not be full-fledged members, but there may be some kind of action by the victim that leads [MS-13] to believe they are a rival gang member.
Q: What kind of crime does MS-13 involve itself with? What drives them to violence?
A: Mexican and Columbian cartels—in the amount of power they hold and the financial holdings they have—have a lock on the drug market. So it’s hard for MS-13 to really get a foothold in the drug market. So they really get whatever local markets are left over—whatever those organizations are willing to allow MS-13 to do.
What you see locally is their main form of revenue is extortion. Originally we would see that limited to underground economies, bordellos—or houses of prostitution—[and] cantinas—or unlicensed bars and restaurants that might serve ethnic food as well as beer and wine.

People without status here usually don’t have IDs to get alcohol, so you have this underground economy that serves this clientele. The gang is not running those businesses, but extorting them, providing quote-unquote “protection.”
What we are starting to see and [are] working on is that MS-13 is extorting from legitimate businesses within the Hispanic community. Anecdotally, you are seeing that with apartment complexes where there are a large amount of Hispanic residents.
[MS-13] are consistently looking for people and saying, “We will provide you protection to live in this community.”
The other case you hear anecdotally is where there are legitimate businesses, beer and wine stores for example, of El Salvadorian descent whose proprietors are being threatened by the gang to provide liquor to them and sell to these illicit cantinas. They use social media to realize who the proprietor of the business is, to figure out who their family members are in El Salvador, and they then threaten to do harm to them.
That is outside the reach of American law enforcement. That’s a very difficult problem to work on.
Q: How do you work with federal law enforcement to combat MS-13?
A: We are working closely with the U.S. Attorney’s Office in recent months. We have a large RICO [Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act] case where we have 15 gang members who have been federally indicted and are being prosecuted.
Just like we do with other federal task forces, we have our [Montgomery County Police Department] members on the joint terrorism task force and DEA [Drug Enforcement Agency] task force. Similarly, we have task forces looking at gang activity as well.
We work with the Department of Homeland Security’s investigations arm to try to look at the gang holistically and target the organization as a whole to include its hierarchy.
Q: What is the Montgomery County Police Department’s approach to combating MS-13?
A: We take a holistic or “whole of government” approach.
We have three pillars: prevention, intervention, and suppression, based on best practices from gang programs throughout the country. What you see in Montgomery County on the preventative side is the Recreation Department of the county government going into neighborhoods where there are at-risk youth, to provide positive alternatives so they don’t fall under the lure of the gang.
Montgomery County [Public] Schools is doing similar things.
Intervention falls under the county’s Health and Human Services Department with street outreach, doing outreach in neighborhoods providing the full gamut of services: social, mental health, and other ways that may strengthen the family network and trying to find what’s best to help the child and family divert from gang activity.
Last is the suppression, that falls on the police. All police officers are tasked with [fighting] criminal activity.
Q: Why is Montgomery County vulnerable to MS-13? In other words, why is MS-13 so active in the county?
A: You see that we have a large enclave in the greater D.C. area of Central Americans and a certain percent, a small percentage, are going to be gang members or targeted by gang members.
I can tell you stories anecdotally where somebody starts into the gang and acquiesces and hopes they can limit their activity in the gang and says, “I will just do enough to be a part of the gang and not be targeted by them anymore.” But that starts the grooming process that goes on. There are others in MS-13 that are attached to the power and influence, but there are some who join the gang reluctantly.
MS-13 has become more prominent locally. We have seen the acts are becoming more isolated in the Hispanic community and that’s the double-edged sword for us. You hear from nonprofit organizations that work in these communities, and from school resource officers, that the Latino community where MS-13 has a presence is terrified. At the same time, that also makes them fearful to come forward to report.
One of the things I have been trying to emphasize is that the community’s silence is the gang’s strength.
Q: The Trump administration has pledged to aggressively target MS-13 and to deport its members. Can tougher immigration enforcement help combat MS-13 in Montgomery County?
A: I don’t really want to go there. But I will say, clearly, if you look not only at Montgomery County, but other law enforcement agencies across the U.S. that have large immigrant populations, they have all taken the same stance that it’s hard enough for the community to come forward to tell us activities that are going on with the gang.
If that same community also fears they will be deported if they come forward, that is just one other factor that prevents us from getting an understanding of what is going on in those communities, and it’s one more reason for the community not to go forward.
Q: How would you assess the progress you have made in combating MS-13? Do you think MS-13 will always have a presence in Montgomery County?
A: I think we are in a good place right now. Some of the things the [Trump] administration has been talking about have been ongoing in Montgomery County and the greater D.C. area.
We are using all our resources at the local and federal level to go after MS-13. The violence, it’s clear to us that it is something that can’t be tolerated in the community.
I don’t know if we can totally eliminate MS-13, but you can target the gang and its hierarchy and put pressure on them.
With every successful prosecution and case we bring that tells [MS-13] that they can’t continue to operate the way they have, we are sending the message that law enforcement won’t tolerate this.
The more successful we have community participation in some of these prosecutions, the more that will help us as well. When the greater community comes forward and says, “Look, we have had enough and we will come to the police to help,” that is a positive sign as well.

"Moses Henry and Steven Blaisdell depend on Friendship House, a residential drug treatment center in Bethlehem, New Hampshire, to recover from opioid addiction. (Photo: Josh Siegel/The Daily Signal)
BETHLEHEM, N.H.—They came to be addicted to drugs in different ways, but ended up in the same place.
Steven Blaisdell, 26, a stocky, shy son of a mailman, was first prescribed pain medicine—the opioid OxyContin—as a teenager after he flipped over his four-wheeler and broke his left femur in half.
Over the past 14 years, Blaisdell has had surgery seven times as a result of recreational injuries that are common here in “North Country,” where young men treat the outdoors—mountains, ski jumps, and hiking trails—like a playground.

Part 2 of 5: One Opioid Addict Helps Another Choose Life Over Death
When he sits down, Blaisdell’s left shoulder droops lower than his right, dragged down by a 9-inch plate, the result of a dirt bike accident.
Blaisdell says his pain went away when he took up to 15 OxyContin pills per day, much more than he was prescribed.
After doctors stopped prescribing him the painkiller, Blaisdell—21 years old at the time and arthritic from repeated physical trauma—turned to heroin, a cheaper, illicit opioid, smoking it instead of injecting it because he’s scared of needles.
“From the time I was 13, doctors were pushing me pain pills as a safe alternative,” Blaisdell tells The Daily Signal four days after he relapsed on heroin over the Easter holiday, ending his latest attempt at sobriety. “I was prescribed pretty high amounts of them for a long time. I didn’t really have a lot of education growing up or warning about addiction until I was already addicted. So that’s kind of how it started for me.”
Moses Henry, 35, small in stature and blunt in speech, with body tattoos and face piercings, says he sought out drugs to fit in with friends.
Henry started with pot at 12 years old, graduated to cocaine at 15, and became addicted to OxyContin by the time he was 18, attracted to the stronger high and ease of purchase on the streets.
“I wasn’t in pain,” says Henry, who nearly died after he overdosed in the bathroom of his parents’ house over a year ago. “Drugs brought me up. I could do anything I wanted to do on OxyContin, on opioids. I am my own worst enemy.”
On just another foggy, gray late April day in northern New Hampshire, Blaisdell and Henry sit next to each other at a picnic table inside the poorly lit kitchen of a dilapidated, secluded cottage. This is the region’s only residential drug treatment center.

Friendship House, as the place is called, is where Blaisdell and Henry took themselves before it was too late.
Blaisdell and Henry are both from Coos County, which has the highest combined death rate due to drugs, alcohol, or suicide in all of New England, comprising counties in six states.
The death rate is defined as the number of drug-related, alcohol-related, and suicide deaths per 100,000 people.
Coos County, New Hampshire’s poorest, also is the state’s largest county by land mass but smallest according to population.
Driving through the county’s numerous tiny and nearly deserted towns, where cellphone service becomes scarcer as a visitor creeps north—closer to the Canadian border—it’s difficult to appreciate how anybody could know anybody, because there doesn’t seem to be anybody living here.
A recent senior class at Pittsburg High School, in Coos County’s northernmost town, graduated one person.
But many of the county’s 30,000 residents are related by drug addiction, familiar with the region’s—and nation’s–opioid epidemic in some way.
“I can spot another addict from a mile away,” Henry says, motioning a couple feet away to his right, at Blaisdell. “You try to escape it, but it’s hard.”
In Recovery, ‘Short Window of Opportunity’
Blaisdell and Henry are in the same residence, but at different stages of recovery.
Henry is employed as a “recovery coach” at Friendship House, where he became sober 14 months ago as a resident here. He is mentoring Blaisdell, who is voluntarily participating in a 90-day, low-intensity residential treatment program, designed to support drug users in the early stages of recovery.

Part 5: The First Responders Who Witness a Dreadful Toll
Serving New Hampshire’s three most northern counties, including Coos, Friendship House offers individual and family counseling, group therapy, and a place to live in a structured setting.
Many of the residents are homeless before they come here. Blaisdell and Henry both have been homeless at points of their addiction.
The facility, a one-story, wood-frame building in a wooded area that looks like a camp site, is not up to code and has only 18 beds. That’s not enough to serve the Northern Country, the upper third of New Hampshire, says Friendship House’s director, Kristy Letendre.

New Hampshire has the second-lowest level of access to substance abuse treatment in the nation, above only Texas, according to the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.
Friendship House is a part of the Tri-County Community Action Program, a nonprofit that also offers services to the homeless, elderly, and victims of sexual and domestic abuse.
Letendre says Friendship House recently received a federal Community Development Block Grant to construct a new building that meets code requirements and will allow the center to expand to 32 beds. As part of that expansion, the Tri-County Community Action Program recently merged with North Country Health Consortium, a similar nonprofit provider.

Letendre says growth is necessary because she regularly has to turn down drug addicts who want to stay at Friendship House, with individuals facing a wait time that can span four to six weeks.
That delay could be too long to make a difference.
“There is a short window of opportunity when you are talking to somebody who is ready to give up using,” says Letendre, a hard-charging 38-year-old who wears dangling earrings and a jean jacket.
“If they make a call to you at that point, they are hopeless, they have burned every bridge, and they are going to die if they continue to use,” Letendre adds, pounding a table for emphasis, her wrist jewelry clanking:
If they pick up the phone and call me, if I can bring them right in, I have a chance to save that life. If I can’t bring them in, and have to tell them they have to wait to get into treatment services, at that point they lose hope. ‘No one cares about me, I don’t care if I live or die.’ You are playing Russian roulette. So they go out and use, and when they use, that is when you see the overdose.
‘Easier to Die’
Henry says he became committed to recovery after overdosing for the seventh—and latest—time in January 2016.
He was revived by his father, who gave him CPR for seven minutes on the bathroom floor of the family home before the ambulance came.
“That look in his eyes really destroyed me,” Henry says of his father, who before this most intimate of moments had not been on speaking terms with his son. “I don’t know what he said to me. I can tell you what I said to him. I asked him where my drugs were and why did you even bother reviving me. Because it was easier to die at that moment. It was the easiest way out. I didn’t want to do what I needed to do to get sober. Because it’s hard work. It was easier to just give up on everything.”
As his parents drove him to Friendship House from their home in Berlin, Coos’ only city, Henry says he injected a gram and a half of heroin.

Henry had been to Friendship House once before, eight years ago now, but quickly relapsed after he detoxed.
“I am an addict, and I’m sorry,” Henry says. “It didn’t work out the first time, but I didn’t put any effort into my recovery.”
He says he was inspired to recover after he read a handwritten letter by his 14-year-old niece, Padence, who calls him Uncle Mosey.
In the letter, which Henry provided to The Daily Signal, Padence writes that she feared her uncle “would die before I was able to have him in my life again.”
Padence has seen Henry high on drugs.
“I never truly had my uncle in my life for my whole life,” Padence recalls, in neat handwriting and flawless spelling:
I got to have him for a little while. But I never held on too much cause I would always lose him again. Because I love him, it was hard. After a while, I couldn’t stand seeing him. I never hated him, but I hated the things he did and who he became.
At his lowest points, Henry took 10 grams of heroin a day, he says, and stole from his parents and grandparents to feed his drug addiction. It was a stark fall.
He had lived a middle-class childhood provided by his father, who worked in a paper mill before the industry dissolved over the past 20 years. He says his parents never drank or used drugs.
Henry says he started and ran his own carpentry business for eight years, claiming that he made six figures at 18 years old.
‘It Gets Easier, but Harder Too’
Today, Henry aspires to go to college to become a drug and alcohol counselor, and he’s here to articulate to Blaisdell the challenges of recovery.
This is also Blaisdell’s second stay at Friendship House.
The first time, he remained sober for an intensive 28-day program, where he detoxed off the opioid drugs.
But shortly after leaving, Blaisdell relapsed, using heroin on Easter to escape from family pressures, he says.
“He didn’t fail,” Henry says reassuringly of Blaisdell, who was living in a homeless shelter at the time of his relapse. “It’s a speed bump. I told him don’t beat himself up over it. It does happen. It’s hell. Addiction is hell. What he’s going through—it gets easier, but it gets harder too.”
Blaisdell says he’s in a better position to stay sober now that he has detoxed once and experienced the symptoms of withdrawal.
“The best way I can describe it is to say it’s like when you are very hungry or very thirsty and it just takes over your mind and it’s all you can think about,” Blaisdell says. “Where am I going to get my next meal, where am I going to get my next dose [of drugs]? Getting the next dose is really all you think about. The opioid withdrawals are so intense that you become quite fearful when you go through it.”

Letendre says Blaisdell’s experience is typical for an addict. Repeated use of an opioid, she says, can alter an individual’s brain chemistry and lead to physical and psychological dependence.
Opiates change the way the brain responds to pain and can produce a “high” feeling, disrupting the brain’s reward and pleasure centers. Without the drug, the body may not feel what it learned to know as normal, leading to withdrawal symptoms such as sweats, muscle aches, vomiting, and diarrhea.
“When our body builds this physical dependence, the withdrawal is severe and immediate,” Letendre says. “The user will do everything they possibly can to get the money to get their fix.”
‘Keep Up His Habit’
While Blaisdell says he chose on his own volition to come to Friendship House to get better, his experience here may have an outsize impact on his future.
In September 2016, according to court records obtained by The Daily Signal, Blaisdell was indicted in Coos County Superior Court on multiple felony charges of selling heroin and fentanyl—a more powerful synthetic pain medication—and engaging in a conspiracy to sell drugs.
Blaisdell made $10,000 bail—paid by his father—and has a pretrial hearing scheduled for September.
His court-appointed attorney, Joseph Garrison, says Blaisdell sold drugs to a state police officer who was undercover.
Garrison, in an interview with The Daily Signal, says Blaisdell told him he sold drugs to make money to feed his own addiction. In New Hampshire, Garrison says, Class B felonies, with which Blaisdell has been charged, are punishable by a maximum sentence of three to seven years in state prison.
“Unfortunately, Steven’s situation is far too common right now,” Garrison says. “He became addicted, and based on my understanding, it was one of these things where he was trying to keep up his habit. He’s not big time. He’s not like a giant dealer. It’s more a personal-use type situation. He’s a really nice guy who just has a really severe drug problem.”
Garrison, who represents clients in New Hampshire’s three northernmost counties—Coos, Grafton, and Carroll—says half of his caseload involves drug-related offenses. [Note: When first published, this report incorrectly said Groveton rather than Grafton.]

He advises clients such as Blaisdell to seek treatment before trial to show they want to overcome their drug problem.
“I have too many of these cases,” Garrison says, adding:
I have clients who overdose and die before trial. I have had clients go out and commit more crime. Steven is taking this to heart, which is a huge silver lining in the case. Our hope is we can keep that going so he stays sober and makes better choices in the future.
Blaisdell, for his part, acknowledges to The Daily Signal that he is charged with drug-related crimes, although he does not admit directly to selling drugs.
“What most people don’t realize is that a lot of the dealers are addicts themselves and they are just trying to get by,” Blaisdell says.
He insists his ambition to fulfill Friendship House’s treatment program is genuine, and not just about looking good for court.
“I want to get better,” Blaisdell says. “That’s why I am here. Can I imagine going back to drugs? I can imagine it, but it’s absolutely not what I want. This addiction has taken my independence from me. It’s ruined every relationship I ever had. I am now just starting to make amends with my older sisters and getting my family back—and my life. You become very selfish. I’m always one of the last people to ask people for help. I always wait until it’s either too late or close to it.”
Letendre, the Friendship House director, knows about Blaisdell’s criminal charges. She says she’s had plenty of residents who’ve relapsed during their path to recovery, and she didn’t consider Blaisdell’s recent slip-up in deciding whether to give him another opportunity.
She says without treatment, Blaisdell—facing prison time—could experience a worse outcome.
“When a person says, ‘I need help to save my life,’ absolutely they are usually ready,” Letendre says. “If I can’t that first time, I hope that second time I can help.”
‘Hope in a Small Rural Community’
For addicts in the North Country, the path to get better is especially steep, because the reminders—and temptations—of drug abuse are so close.
“I know a lot of people in active use,” Henry says. “You know, I have buried seven or eight friends in the past year. Two brothers OD’d within a week of each other. That mother buried two kids within two weeks.”
Despite the bleakness around them, Blaisdell and Henry say they want to spend the rest of their lives in or near Coos County. They see beauty where others see economic struggle and pain.
“North Country has a lot of resilience,” Henry says. “I love the outdoors, I love the four seasons.”
To find fulfillment in Coos County and live drug-free, Henry and Letendre advise Blaisdell to strive to make new friends, to form a peer group of sober-minded people like he has at Friendship House.
“Moses [Henry] is the hope in a small rural community,” Letendre says, explaining:
If you are going back to a community that has nothing but your old dealers, what are you going to do? How are you going to change your friends? How are you going to make connections? You need to have a safe place—strong support when you go home.
Addiction is like chronic illness. It’s never going go away. There is no cure for it. All we can do is provide support, provide education. A person can be successful when that person has everything in place for them. Relapse is inevitable unless those supports are in place.

Blaisdell says he is on good terms with his parents, after years in which they refused to speak with him.
“I believe my family is 100 percent supportive of me being here,” Blaisdell says. “If they aren’t willing to accept me, all I can do is the best I can. If they aren’t willing to accept my apology, I just got to move on or maybe try again.”
Currently unemployed, Blaisdell says he wants to return to working as a mechanic. In high school, he says, he earned certification for state inspections, although he struggled to hold down related jobs because of his addiction.
At Friendship House, Blaisdell takes out the trash and cleans toilets.
“It’s good to know I can do the job and know it’s done right,” he says. “I live here, and want it to be clean and sanitary.”
Friendship House prescribes chores to instill discipline and ownership as part of recovery.
It’s a sort of return to childhood—before the drugs—that Blaisdell says he embraces.
“The drug lifestyle leads nowhere,” Blaisdell says. “It just brings pain and eventually death. A lot of addicts know that, but they are just scared to give it up. I figure if I put half the effort into being sober as I did being an addict, I know I can do it.”

"Donald Trump, pictured campaigning for president in Manchester, New Hampshire, never traveled to Coos County but won the poor county decisively.

COLEBROOK, N.H.—His left foot in a walking boot after surgery, Rick Samson, an independent-minded county commissioner in the northernmost part of New Hampshire, is behind the wheel of his pickup truck, describing how this region—“North Country” to locals—is used to going it alone.
“I run as a Republican, however I consider myself neither a Republican or Democrat, or conservative, or liberal—I am an American and that’s where it starts,” Samson, 70, says in a New England accent that reveals exactly where he’s from.
So it’s totally within character for the people of Coos County, whom Samson serves, to depend on themselves to overcome the county’s distinction as the place with the highest combined death rate due to drugs, alcohol, or suicide in all of New England.

Part 1 of 5: The Crisis That May Have Swung Voters From Obama to Trump
“This is how the North Country works: We are collaborative, it’s not territorial; we try to do the best that we can and spread it out because we have so little,” Samson says. “We don’t have a lot.”
Coos County, part of “North Country,” the term locals use to define the northern third of New Hampshire, is the poorest in the state. The county is New Hampshire’s largest by area—1,830 square miles—containing numerous tiny towns spread far apart—and the smallest by population, with its 33,000 people representing less than 3 percent of the state.
Coos County has long had high rates of alcohol addiction. In recent years, though, opioids—mainly legally prescribed painkillers, but also the more potent and addictive heroin—have become the substance most abused.
Coos, like many other places in the U.S., is amid an epidemic of opioid overdoses.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, opioids—including prescription drugs as well as heroin—killed more than 33,000 Americans in 2015, more than in any previous year. Opioids now kill more people than car accidents; in 2015, more heroin deaths occurred nationwide than homicides involving guns.

New Hampshire has the second-highest drug overdose rate among all states, with 34 deaths per 100,000 residents in 2015.
Both of Samson’s parents were alcoholics, he says, and his youngest daughter’s husband died from alcoholism.
“I am very familiar with addiction,” Samson tells The Daily Signal as he speeds his truck deeper into the low fog hovering over a winding, deserted road, with few people and passing vehicles in sight.
Coos County also suffers from severe economic distress related to the loss of manufacturing jobs.
In 1980, manufacturing jobs comprised 38 percent of all jobs in Coos. In 2014, only 7 percent of jobs in the county were in manufacturing. Payroll wages from manufacturing have dropped from 49 percent to 9 percent since the mid-1980s.
“Life here is hard,” Samson says, pronouncing the word as hahd. “This area is so desperate for jobs, for anything, that [Coos residents] will do anything. You have nothing to do, so you are likely going to involve yourself in drugs and alcohol. This region has been decaying from within for quite a while. And hardly anyone notices.”

Coos County, one of the nation’s most consistent swing counties, once found hope in Barack Obama, the Democrat from Chicago who voters easily re-elected as president in 2012.
Their hopes unfulfilled, a majority of Coos voters turned during the 2016 presidential election to another nontraditional politician promising change—billionaire developer and celebrity Donald Trump, running as a Republican.
Trump’s success in Coos County—he earned 52 percent of the vote, compared to Republican nominee Mitt Romney’s 40 percent in 2012—speaks to a little-discussed larger trend of the 2016 election involving rural parts of America and former manufacturing power centers.
A recent study by Penn State University showed Trump outperformed Romney most dramatically in counties where the drug, alcohol, and suicide mortality rate is among the nation’s highest. The mortality rate is defined as the number of drug-related, alcohol-related, and suicide deaths per 100,000 people.

Trump also won 18 of the 25 states that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said had the most drug overdoses in 2015.
Shannon M. Monnat, the Penn State study’s author and an assistant professor of rural sociology and demography, found that counties with high economic distress also have higher death rates related to substance abuse and voted strongly for Trump.
“Clearly there is an association between drug, alcohol, and suicide mortality and Trump’s election performance,” Monnat writes in her study, published in December, adding:
However, this relationship should not be interpreted as causal. No single factor can explain this election outcome. To suggest otherwise ignores the economic, social, and demographic complexities that drive human behavior and the contexts of the communities where these voters live. What these analyses demonstrate is that community-level well-being played an important role in the 2016 election, particularly in the parts of America far-removed from the world of urban elites, media, and foundations.
‘With You 1,000%’
Trump, like his general election opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton, often repeated a campaign pledge to curb opioid abuse.
As the Republican nominee, Trump traveled to New Hampshire promising to combat the state’s opioid epidemic, which extends beyond Coos County.

Part 5: The First Responders Who Witness a Dreadful Toll
In 2015, more than 400 people in New Hampshire died as a result of drug overdoses, up from 326 such deaths in 2014 and 192 in 2013.
Trump, who finished first with 35 percent in the state’s crowded GOP primary field, said he would provide funding to local clinics to treat opioid abuse, and stop the flow of drugs coming into the state.
“I just want to let the people of New Hampshire know that I’m with you 1,000 percent, you really taught me a lot,” Trump said during a roundtable on the opioid crisis, where he met with residents affected by the drug epidemic and spoke of his own family’s history with addiction.
In interviews with The Daily Signal, Coos County voters say Trump’s promise of beating the opioid epidemic doesn’t explicitly explain his electoral success here.

Rather, Trump’s “America first” economic promise of bringing back manufacturing jobs from overseas, and renegotiating trade deals, was tailor-made for Coos, which has an aging population that is 97 percent white.
“I think people think as a whole that Trump will bring back manufacturing and get people back to work,” says Steve Cass, the chief of police in Colebrook, a town in Coos with 2,300 residents.
Cass says he usually votes Republican but doesn’t identify with a party.
“It was government that sold us down the river by basically allowing all these higher-paying production jobs to go overseas,” he says, “and maybe [residents] think it is government that can bring those jobs back.”
Karl Ruch, chairman of the Coos County Republican Committee, says few of his group’s 60 members—and other voters they interacted with—talked about response to the opioid crisis as a direct driver of their vote for president. But many, Ruch says, had personal encounters with addiction in some way.
Ruch, 60, was born and raised in Lancaster, a town of 3,500 and the county seat, where he worked for 20 years in the emergency room of a hospital, sometimes treating drug overdoses.

Health care and prisons (Berlin, Coos County’s only city, is home to both a state and federal prison) are the predominant industries today in the region.
The county routinely is ranked last in the state for the quality of public health, measured by indicators such as length of life, diet and exercise, income, access to housing and transportation, and drug and alcohol use.
Ruch says it’s intuitive that residents struggling through traumas—loss of a job or a home—could succumb to drugs and alcohol, and that solving those underlying problems could help curb their addictions.
“Trump’s message [gave] people the hope of bringing manufacturing jobs to the area again,” Ruch says, explaining:
When people thought about someone being able to re-energize manufacturing again, people also thought a lot of their other problems would be resolved. Trump may not have the exact answer, but there’s a ripple effect. If you have the economy growing, people after a long work day of logging or farming—true American jobs—want to go home and go to bed, and they don’t have time to get in trouble. They can have pride for themselves again, they can earn a paycheck and provide for their family.
In the 2012 general election, Obama won 57.9 percent of the vote in Coos County. (He also won the county in 2008, although Clinton beat him there in the primary.)
“The majority of people in Coos County do not like government,” Emily Stone Jacobs, the 34-year-old chairwoman of the Coos County Democrats, tells The Daily Signal. “But there is a lot of need in Coos County, and the people here responded to Obama’s message of hope and change.”
In addition to politics, Stone Jacobs works on the frontlines of the local opioid addiction crisis. She is a mental health counselor at Northern Human Services in Berlin, a nonprofit whose patients often have substance abuse issues.

Stone Jacobs attributes Trump’s success to Clinton’s unpopularity among Coos County voters.
“Coos County did not like Hillary Clinton,” Stone Jacobs says. “Trump winning here had mostly to do with Clinton being the nominee. I don’t think our drug addiction crisis had any influence on Trump winning.”
She notes that Trump did not set foot here during the campaign. The closest he came was a February 2016 stop in Plymouth, New Hampshire, a town in Grafton County bordering Coos to the south. Plymouth is about a two-hour drive from Colebrook.
By contrast, during the Democrats’ primary campaign, Bernie Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont, traveled to the county for a town hall in Berlin. With his plain-spoken style, Sanders ran on an economic platform similar to Trump’s, Stone Jacobs notes, and promised to boost funding for mental health and opioid addiction treatment.
Sanders earned 63 percent of the Coos County vote in the Democrat primary, beating eventual nominee Clinton by 28 points, the widest disparity of any county in the state. Sanders also earned a larger share of the total primary vote in Coos than Trump.
Once a ‘Great Place’
Coos County used to be a political destination and a tourist draw, says Samson, the county commissioner.
On a cold and dreary April morning, Samson is driving past what was once the Balsams Grand Resort and Hotel, an international hotel and ski destination that the federal government had listed on the National Register of Historic Places as worthy of preservation.
But the 400-room Balsams resort, a fortresslike compound surrounded by mountains and built on 11,000 acres—including a championship golf course—closed almost six years ago.

The hotel has major political symbolism: Every four years, residents cast ballots here at midnight in the first presidential primary votes in the nation. Ronald Reagan and both George Bushes made pitches to voters at the hotel.
In 2016, the first-in-the nation voting tradition continued, but in a hotel with no residents. Only Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a Republican presidential candidate, made it up here.
Today, the hotel’s various buildings stand intact, except for a dormitory for employees, which is partially—not all the way—torn down, as if frozen in time.
Samson, who has spent his entire life in Coos County besides a five-year stint in the Navy, recalls wistfully that his son and two daughters once worked at the 150-year-old hotel.
His children served food, but often smelled rubber, Samson says. That’s because the original owners of the hotel, the Tillotson family, ran a rubber factory on adjacent property.
The Tillotson Rubber Co., credited with creating the first latex balloons and gloves, shuttered in the 1980s, swallowed by overseas competition. An empty plot of melting snow marks its former existence.
“This is not the way this place always looked,” Samson says. “Balsams used to be known as ‘Switzerland of America.’ Between 1895 and 1905, Berlin was the largest paper-producing city in the world. It was a great place to raise a family.”

The fate of Coos County has regional consequences.
Coos is one of only two counties in the U.S. to border two states—Vermont and Maine—and another country, Canada.
One of the region’s largest employers, the furniture manufacturer Ethan Allen just over the Connecticut River—which marks the border—ceased production in Beecher Falls, Vermont, in 2009, putting about 250 people out of jobs.
The county’s once-dominant paper industry is in sharp decline, if not gone altogether.
Berlin used to draw labor from all over Europe to work in its paper mills. But Berlin has seen its population decrease to about half the peak of more than 20,000 in the 1930s.
‘Getting the Boot Down’
Cass, Colebrook’s police chief for the past 13 years, says local residents have learned not to expect much help from politicians.
“We don’t get the help from the outside and we don’t rely upon them, either,” says Cass, 48, whose matter-of-fact way masks his jolly demeanor.
Cass, born and raised in Coos County, is taking it upon himself to spend a day on patrol.

His nine-officer police department (only five are full time) is housed inside Colebrook Town Hall, which also hosts the tax collector, town manager, and district court.
Cass begins his shift driving his unmarked SUV through the Windsor Estates trailer park—an unfitting name for a cluster of mobile homes where residents are all low-income and white.
A “large percentage” of calls to the police in Colebrook come from the trailer park, Cass says, mostly related to domestic disturbances and opioid misuse.
“This right here is an example of what’s becoming Colebrook and Coos County,” Cass says of Windsor Estates. “This area has been getting nothing but getting the boot down, just getting stomped on. Jobs have not come back, nothing has regenerated, and what we get is politicians saying they know the plight of North Country, and Coos County, but nothing changes.”

The police department, Cass says, makes only a few arrests a week and a little more than 100 in a year. But in a small town like this, the impact of crime is closely felt, and its origins easy to trace.
“Most our crime is related to the use and sale of drugs,” Cass says. “The opioid problem for us started at the prescription level. Let’s face it. When it comes down to it, we put ourselves in the position we are in because of overprescribing. It’s coming from within.”
‘Part of the Problem, Part of the Solution’
Coos County’s opioid epidemic mirrors America’s. It started with doctors prescribing pain medication such as oxycodone or methadone for legitimate reasons.
From 1999 to 2013, the amount of opioids prescribed in the U.S. nearly quadrupled, the CDC says, and today about 2 million Americans are addicted to them.
Opioid pain relievers generally are safe when taken for a short time as prescribed by a doctor, but because they produce euphoria as well as pain relief, they can be misused. Prolonged use can increase the risk of addiction, overdose, and death.
In Coos County, on-the-job injuries are common, and popular recreational activities—thrill rides through the mountains on ATVs and dirt bikes—can be dangerous.
“This is a playground up here,” says Laurie Connors, director of behavioral health services at Indian Stream Health Center, the largest health care provider in Coos. “The mentality ‘Live Free or Die’ [New Hampshire’s official motto] does explain a lot.”

Indian Stream Health Center is one of 11 federally qualified health centers in New Hampshire, meaning it provides comprehensive services—primary care, dental, mental health—to an underserved area. This designation also means it qualifies for federal funding and enhanced reimbursement for Medicare and Medicaid.
Because the center offers services for all kinds of care—to about 4,000 patients per year, regardless of ability to pay—Indian Stream doctors prescribe more medication than any other provider in the area.
Jonathan Brown, Indian Stream’s CEO, acknowledges that his center was part of the problem, as doctors responded to demand for pain pills from low-income residents who couldn’t afford alternative services for pain, such as physical therapy.
“You’d have to go back decades when pain became a vital sign and the pharmaceutical industry began influencing prescriptions of these medications as the end-all be-all, and how delivering that medication impacted patient satisfaction surveys, which affects our reimbursement,” Brown says in an interview with The Daily Signal.
“A patient comes in with pain and the provider says, ‘I will give you five days [of medication], but then I need you to stretch and do your exercises and change your lifestyle.’ Patients aren’t doing that. They want the quick fix. They want the pill.”

In response to the trend of overprescribing, the state of New Hampshire in January implemented new protocols requiring medical professionals to conduct a risk assessment before prescribing opioids.
Patients also must sign an informed consent form, which allows doctors to access a database in the state’s prescription drug monitoring program to ensure the patient isn’t seeking drugs from multiple doctors. The form describes the risks of overdose and addiction, and requires the patient to submit to random pill counts to ensure he or she is taking the prescribed amount of medication.
Indian Stream is taking these regulations a step further, requiring patients who receive prescription pain medicine for 28 days or longer to participate in treatment at the facility, such as a substance abuse class or group therapy.
“We have the self-awareness to be honest with ourselves to say, ‘We have been a part of the problem, and we have to be a part of the solution,’” Brown says, adding:
And it’s wrong to say prescription opioids are bad. It’s more appropriate to say the misuse of those opioids are bad. Our responsibility is to educate, inform, and raise awareness for how to safely use prescription medication, how to keep our children safe, and how to teach our children to live healthy lifestyles. We are lucky enough to be in a position to do God’s work, and this organization provides a vehicle for us to do that. And we will.
A New Drug That’s ‘Killing People’
As prescriptions have become more tightly regulated, and there is less supply of cheap opioid pain pills on the street, increasingly addictive drugs such as heroin and fentanyl have replaced them.
These illicit drugs come from outside Coos County.
Fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid mostly used in medical settings to relieve pain related to cancer, is especially worrisome to local law enforcement officials. Fentanyl is often manufactured illegally for nonmedical use, and is frequently found as a street drug mixed with heroin.
According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, it usually originates from China and is sometimes trafficked directly into the U.S. or through Canada.
Carfentanil is one of fentanyl’s many analogs. It is typically used as a tranquilizer for large animals such as elephants, and it can kill people exposed to even tiny amounts.
According to the CDC, the fraction of drug overdose deaths across the nation involving synthetic drugs such as fentanyl rose from 8 percent in 2010 to 18 percent in 2015.
From 2014 to 2015, heroin overdose death rates in the U.S. increased by 21 percent, with nearly 13,000 dying in 2015.
“It’s easy to say the opioid crisis is a problem of legal prescription drugs,” Seth Leibsohn, co-director of Americans for Responsible Drug Policy, says in an interview with The Daily Signal.
“But most of the deaths of late are not happening that way,” adds Leibsohn, a former chief of staff to William Bennett, who served as “drug czar” under President George H.W. Bush. “Deaths from prescribed opioids are a problem, but the majority of deaths from those come from the diversion and illegal distribution of them.”

John McCormick, the Coos County attorney and chief law enforcement officer, says that in 2015, five overdose deaths in the county resulted from the use of fentanyl. Last year, fentanyl killed three people here.
“Fentanyl is what’s killing people,” McCormick says quietly, sounding almost resigned to this fact in an interview with The Daily Signal in his office, where soft jazz plays in the background.
“The goal for overdose deaths in the county should be zero. We don’t want any people dying. Is it possible? I don’t know. In this climate, probably not right now.”
‘Got to Save Kids’
With the opioid crisis here evolving, and already having victimized the working class, local leaders are turning to protect the next generation—or at least what’s left of it.
Cass, the Colebrook police chief, says a recent graduating class of the high school in Pittsburg—the northernmost town in all of New Hampshire—had one student.
The town, part of Coos County, has fewer than 1,000 residents.
“Imagine that—that boy is the salutatorian and valedictorian all in one,” Cass says facetiously.
“Most of our adolescents who graduate, they move on,” he adds, noting the example of his own three children, all of whom graduated from Coos County schools but plan to find work outside the region.

The public school district in Berlin, serving 1,200 students in four schools, has taken especially aggressive action to guard against opioid abuse among the youth.
Corinne Cascadden, Berlin’s relentlessly upbeat superintendent of schools, says she currently knows of six to eight students who are active drug users.
In 2013, almost 6 percent of Berlin High School students admitted trying heroin at least once, according to a CDC survey. The New Hampshire average for heroin use among high school students is 3 percent.
Last year, the Berlin school board made the anti-overdose drug Narcan available in the nurse’s office at all schools. The drug, a nasal spray that instantly can reverse an opioid overdose, has not had to be used on a student yet, Cascadden says.
The school district is also in its third year of participating in Project AWARE (Advancing Wellness and Resilience in Education), a mental health program for students funded with federal grant money.

Through the program, teachers, principals, sports coaches, and others are taught how to recognize and respond to mental health issues. Those trained adult leaders can refer students to a mental health counselor inside the school if they meet certain risk factors, such as academic failure, aggressive behavior, and family problems at home.
As of April, about 140 students were being served through the program, which is voluntary since parents may opt not to have their child participate.
“The upside and downside of being a small district is students are known, their behaviors outside of school are known, who they associate with are known, their families are known—often by our staff who have been born and raised in this community,” says Bob Thompson, the school district’s Office of Student Wellness coordinator.
“We are reading the names of the parents of these students in the local paper, or in the police report, for drug and alcohol use. They are growing up in that environment.”
Thompson says he knows of some parents of high school students who use their children to sell drugs to feed their own habits.

The cycle of addiction is literally built inside some Coos County children from birth.
The Androscoggin Valley Hospital, Berlin’s only hospital, reports that 10 percent of children born there are addicted to drugs.
“You can impact students one at a time,” Thompson says, adding:
That’s not to say some of them aren’t already lost. Because we know some of them are. We will not be able to turn around all of those users. It’s important we try, because eventually these students are out in our community and they are either going to be assets or liabilities. We are going to have our police department chasing them around town, and they will be clogging our judicial system, and not being productive members of society, or they will be assets and productive members of society.
Cascadden, a county native who is in her ninth year as superintendent, is invested in this community’s survival.
Her own children went through her schools when she was a principal in the district for 23 years.
She is such a fixture that she says parents sometimes call her to come to students’ homes and get them out of bed and drive them to school.
On these full-service missions, Cascadden has in certain instances seen signs of drug use in the home.
It may seem out of place for a school superintendent to play parent and chauffeur, wandering into homes and taking charge, but then again, what if nobody else is there to solve the problem?
“There is lots of resiliency in this community,” Cascadden says. “You know, we are not afraid to say we have a problem. I mean, we have a drug problem. Why say everything is fine? It is not. But the other piece of that is, OK, what are we going to do about it? Because we are used to solving our own problems, and we are going to make it work because we’ve got to save kids.”

"The U.S. faces an epidemic of opioid overdoses. These drugs, including prescription painkillers, heroin, and fentanyl killed more than 33,000 Americans in 2015, a record number. (Photo: Darryl Dyck/Zuma Press/Newscom)
COLEBROOK, N.H.—Inside a dimly lit room at the largest health care provider in New Hampshire’s least populated county, a circle of drug addicts talk about how to recover.
In this private setting a reporter agrees not to publish the addicts’ names, but most people in and around Colebrook, a decaying town of 2,300, know who they are because of what they’ve become.
“Once you become known as an addict, once you get that name, it stays with you, especially in a small town,” says a bearded mechanic in his late 30s, who says he has been sober from opioid painkillers and heroin for a year.

Part 3 of 5: ‘Dr. Father Pill’ Wants to Be Part of the Solution
He’s trying to stay that way with the support of his girlfriend, a fellow addict and participant in the group therapy session who recently served seven months in jail for selling drugs to pay for her own use.
Among other offenders in the jail, her frail frame marked her as an addict, she says.
“Being an addict, you lost track of values,” the woman shares with the four peers around her, who nod their heads to relate.
“I am not perfect. I have had slip-ups,” she adds, her voice trailing off without completing the thought.
Indian Stream Health Center, the provider hosting the meeting—known formally as an intensive outpatient treatment program—is also the largest prescriber of pain medicine in Coos County, where the town of Colebrook is located.
That means, at a time when Coos County, like America, is experiencing record numbers of deaths related to opioids—including prescription painkillers and heroin—Indian Stream Health Center is trying to resolve a problem it helped create.
No one is more sensitive than John Fothergill to the conflict of providing medicine to people whose pain demands it, but whose bodies can’t tolerate overuse of it.
Fothergill, an Indian Stream physician, is known by some Coos County residents as “Dr. Father Pill.”

The derogatory play on the doctor’s name is a response to a story in the New Hampshire Union Leader finding that Fothergill, in 2013, was the top physician prescriber in the state of the opioid oxycodone hydrochloride, sold under brand names such as OxyContin.
“I have heard that some people say my name is Dr. Father Pill,” Fothergill, 62, tells The Daily Signal in an interview, revealing the nickname without a reporter asking about it. “We certainly prescribe this medicine, and some became addicted to it. I am quite sure I am part of the problem. I am not so naive to say I am not. Right now, I am trying to be more a solution than a part of the problem.”
‘They Blame Me’
When a reporter makes a late April visit to Coos County, New Hampshire’s poorest, several residents bring up Fothergill—by the nickname Father Pill—in describing how an opioid epidemic began here.
Fothergill does not enjoy being the butt of jokes, his name connected to the most unfunny of designations: Coos County has the highest combined death rate due to drugs, alcohol, or suicide in all of New England.
This statistic is felt intimately in a county that is New Hampshire’s largest by land mass—1,830 square miles—but smallest according to population. Coos’ 33,000 people represent less than 3 percent of the state.

Yet Fothergill doesn’t hide from his role in a complex problem, eager to provide context about how doctors like him fit into the multilayered supply chain of opioids.
From 1999 to 2013, the amount of opioids prescribed in the U.S. nearly quadrupled, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and about 2 million Americans today are addicted to them.
According to the Union Leader, Fothergill issued 1,066 prescriptions and refills of oxycodone HCL, or OxyContin, in 2013.
Since that story appeared, Fothergill has made himself more visible. He offered a rebuttal to the Union Leader, saying in a letter to the editor that the story drew an incomplete conclusion since it did not list the number of patients involved or the quantity of medication dispensed.
The story also did not take into account the socioeconomic standing of a particular region, which Fothergill says is relevant because low-income residents are less likely to be able to afford alternative pain treatment such as physical therapy.

Fothergill not only is approaching his 30th year as a physician at Indian Stream, but he also recently became a New Hampshire state legislator. First elected to the state House of Representatives as a Republican in 2014, he has taken on a prominent role in pushing the medical industry to self-regulate as a member of the Health, Human Services and Elderly Affairs Committee.

“I got elected to the state Legislature without even campaigning,” Fothergill says. “So if you lined up every citizen in Colebrook and said, ‘Is Dr. Fothergill a plus or minus?’ the vast majority would say I am a plus in the community for all the work I have done over the years.”
“People are looking for someone to blame, and they blame me or the health center [Indian Stream] and there’s not much I can do about that. I sleep well at night.”
‘Blame to Go Around’
Indian Stream Health Center is one of 11 federally qualified health centers in New Hampshire, meaning it provides comprehensive services—primary care, dental, mental health—to an underserved area. This designation means it qualifies for federal funding and enhanced reimbursement under the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
Because the center offers services for all kinds of care—to about 4,000 patients per year, regardless of their ability to pay—Indian Stream doctors prescribe more medication than any other provider in the area.
Fothergill says strong demand exists in Coos County for pain medicine because many patients are low-income and uninsured, meaning their treatment options are limited.
“If somebody who walks into the office says, ‘I have back pain,’ there is a whole array of things one may do,” Fothergill says. “In Coos County, a lot of those things are not available to us, so probably more often than not, we prescribed pain medicine. Hopefully they would get better and come off of them.”
“Certainly,” he says of the opioid crisis, “the environment was sort of ripe for this to happen.”

Fothergill is not alone in responding aggressively to that environment.
Pete Moran, a physician in family practice at Indian Stream, ranked sixth in the Union Leader’s ranking of top opioid prescribers in 2013.
Moran says that in the 1990s, manufacturers of opioid painkillers marketed the drugs as an elixir to treat pain and downplayed potential harm.
“I have been in practice since the 1990s, when there was a period of time where the idea was that we weren’t adequately controlling pain,” Moran tells The Daily Signal in an interview. “There was a big campaign by the pharmaceuticals to prescribe their medicines.”
The family practitioner says he was personally threatened by a patient for whom he refused to prescribe pain medicine.
“All of the opioids, if used at a high enough dose long enough, will create a dependence: a physical and chemical dependence,” Moran says, adding:
But not everybody that is chemically dependent on an opioid is addicted. Someone who is addicted to a medicine is not just dependent on the medicine, but they also crave the medicine. It gives them a feeling of euphoria, and their life takes on a dimension where they are looking for the drug. You need to find the cause of that pain so you can treat it and fix it. Maybe as doctors we don’t do that well enough. I don’t know.

Caleb Alexander, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Drug Safety and Effectiveness in Baltimore, says prescribers are one peg in a supply chain that has churned out opioids in historic numbers.
The federal Food and Drug Administration has been criticized for too liberally approving painkillers pushed to market by drug manufacturers.
Numerous news reports, meanwhile, have documented how the Drug Enforcement Administration has failed to hold accountable distributors and manufacturers that were creating and shipping millions of painkillers to be prescribed in communities across the U.S.
In Congress, the House Energy and Commerce Committee recently opened an investigation into reports that the DEA reduced enforcement efforts against painkiller distributors during a lobbying campaign by the industry.
“There is plenty of blame to go around and many different parties have played an important role in propagating the opioid epidemic,” Alexander says in an interview with The Daily Signal. “But there’s a very clear correlation to the volume of opioids prescribed and injuries and deaths from these products. So high-volume prescribers are a very important part of the puzzle.”
‘Work Ourselves Out of a Job’
In response to the trend of overprescribing, the state of New Hampshire in January implemented new protocols requiring medical professionals to conduct a risk assessment before prescribing opioids.
Patients also must sign an informed consent form, which allows doctors to access a database in the state’s prescription drug monitoring program to ensure the patient isn’t seeking drugs from multiple doctors.

Fothergill helped shape the legislation requiring these regulations from his perch on the health committee.
“The rules and regulations we came up with were a good compromise,” Fothergill says. “It makes physicians think about what they are doing. You are not just giving a prescription for 30 days and hoping for the best.”
Fothergill also pushed for expansion of Medicaid in the state, which, under Obamacare, requires addiction services and mental health treatment to be included as part of the health care program for the poor.
In Coos County last year, 5.4 percent of residents were covered under the program—more than in any other county in the nation.
Indian Stream is taking these new rules a step further, requiring patients who receive prescription pain medicine for 28 days or longer to participate in treatment at the facility, such as a substance abuse class or group therapy.
As part of services such as the group therapy session attended by The Daily Signal, social workers employed by Indian Stream—the center has five of them—inform patients about the drivers of their addiction.

These social workers try to help patients resolve related life “traumas” that may make them susceptible to addiction.
Coos County is routinely ranked last in the state for quality of public health, measured by indicators such as length of life, diet and exercise, income, access to housing and transportation, and drug and alcohol use.
“The risk of addiction increases based on how much trauma you have experienced,” Laurie Connors, Indian Stream’s director of Behavioral Health Services, says in an interview with The Daily Signal. Connors adds:
Substance abuse is a coping mechanism for pain. You are continuously feeding this cycle and never getting at the root cause of the issue unless you address the social determinants of health—unemployment, domestic violence, poverty.
Indian Stream also offers medication-assisted treatment, a fast-growing response to addiction in which doctors prescribe nonaddictive painkillers that can be used to counteract the effects of opioids.
Seth Leibsohn, co-director of Americans for Responsible Drug Policy, argues that treatment alone won’t stop the opioid addiction epidemic.
“Most of the efforts dealing with the opioid crisis are geared toward recovery, which is important and not to be ignored, but no one is doing prevention,” Leibsohn says in an interview with The Daily Signal. “You want to save all the lives you can. Recovery is really hard. You want to do everything you can, but how about stopping the problem before it starts?”
Leibsohn, a former chief of staff to William Bennett, the nation’s “drug czar” under President George H.W. Bush, says the best way to prevent drug misuse is to educate people about its dangers. He contends that a strong public relations campaign can overcome other factors that may influence drug misuse.
“I have heard often enough from people that opioid addiction is a disease of despair,” Leibsohn says, adding:
While I get that, I don’t want to fall into the trap where we think economics drive substance abuse. I do think people try to anesthetize themselves from problems. But the main driver is not economic. We have given up on the message that drugs are dangerous. There is a cultural message that has destigmatized the problem of drug use that has been going on for close to two decades.

Back in Coos County, Jonathan Brown, Indian Stream’s CEO, says his health care center has a “responsibility” to provide treatment services and better manage its prescription procedures.
Brown, who started work at Indian Stream 13 years ago in an information technology job—giving him a pragmatic perspective—says treating the causes of pain will improve the wellbeing of the community, even if his bottom line suffers because of it.
“A part of our greater responsibility is to help change people’s beliefs about the stigma of mental health and substance abuse, to overcome a culture of hopelessness that has been fostered in Coos County,” Brown tells The Daily Signal in an interview. “Every day our job is to work ourselves out of a job.”
‘Not Going Anywhere’
Despite his efforts to make amends, Fothergill knows the whispers about him won’t go away.
The physician acknowledges that Coos County remains in a drug crisis, and says he regrets not pushing back harder on patients who sought pain medicine but could have been treated first with less risky alternatives.
Fothergill says he plans to retire soon, and vows to spend the rest of his life in Coos County.
“I am not going anywhere,” Fothergill says, adding:
I certainly feel very bad for anyone who may have become addicted because of the medication I started them on, and we don’t want to be creating any more addicts. Aside from the opioid stuff, I actually think I do a pretty good job. For everyone who says I am Dr. Father Pill, multiple patients would say I am the doctor they want to see.

"Legal, national security, and intelligence experts agree the president can declassify or disclose whatever information he wants as part of his constitutional powers as commander in chief. (Photo: Joshua Roberts/Reuters
/Newscom)

President Donald Trump did not violate the law when he reportedly revealed classified information about an Islamic State terrorist plot during a meeting last week with Russian officials, intelligence and legal experts say.
But the news that Trump shared intelligence with the Russians that was provided to the U.S. by a partner country in the Middle East—a nation that had not given the Americans permission to share the information with Russia—raised questions about the legal issues and protocols that surround disclosures of classified information.
>>> In New Russia Stir, White House and Allies Call Leaks to Media Real Problem
The New York Times reported Tuesday that Israel provided the intelligence in question, potentially complicating the U.S. relationship with its important Middle East ally.
H.R. McMaster, Trump’s national security adviser, would not confirm or deny if Trump shared classified information with the Russian foreign minister and ambassador during a meeting at the White House last week. He downplayed the seriousness of the information Trump disclosed, saying that Trump in the moment made the decision to reveal the intelligence to the Russians.
“What the president discussed with the foreign minister was wholly appropriate to that conversation and is consistent with the routine sharing of information between the president and any leaders with whom he’s engaged,” McMaster said at a White House briefing.
Below, The Daily Signal answers basic questions about how the U.S. obtains intelligence, what the process is for classifying and declassifying it, and what the consequences could be of breaking with protocol.
1.) Did Trump Have Legal Authority to Disclose the Information?
Legal, national security, and intelligence experts agree the president can declassify or disclose whatever information he wants as part of his constitutional powers as commander in chief.
“The president is his own declassifying authority,” said David Shedd, an acting director of the Defense Intelligence Agency under President Barack Obama who also served in the George W. Bush administration’s National Security Council.
“He doesn’t have to ask anybody else whether he can declassify anything,” said Shedd, who is now a visiting fellow at The Heritage Foundation, in an interview with The Daily Signal. “As a declassifying officer in his standing as president of the U.S. and commander in chief, no one else has that authority to divulge the information spontaneously—not to mention with information that wasn’t ours to begin with.”
Patrick Eddington, a policy analyst in homeland security and civil liberties at the Cato Institute and a former CIA analyst, agreed that Trump’s legal authority should not be questioned, although he said it’s fair to assess the president’s judgment.
Eddington told The Daily Signal:
What makes the whole office of the president different is that the rules just don’t apply. The only relevant questions are, did Trump break trust with a foreign power who supplied this information by not clearing it with them in advance, which would be bad form but not unprecedented. And two, in doing so, did he potentially compromise a genuine, perishable source?
Even if the president has unique authority, other people can be charged with crimes for revealing classified information.
Experts say a government official could be prosecuted under the Espionage Act of 1917, which prohibits the improper accessing, handling, or transmitting of “information respecting the national defense” with the intent of injuring the U.S. or aiding a foreign nation.
“Under the Espionage Act that person can be charged and probably would be unless the president authorized the disclosure,” said Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the Brennan Center for Justice’s liberty and national security program, in an interview with The Daily Signal.
Government officials who reveal classified information in an unauthorized fashion could also lose their security clearance and job, Goitein said.
2.) What Information Did Trump Disclose, and Was It Appropriate to Do So?
The White House has said Trump did not divulge the source and method of the intelligence he shared with the Russians. The Washington Post reported the information Trump gave to the Russians had to do with an ISIS terrorist threat related to the use of bombs embedded in laptop computers on airplanes.
The U.S. government has already publicly disclosed the laptop threat and acted in response to it.
In March, the U.S. and Britain barred passengers traveling through airports in 10 Muslim-majority countries from carrying laptop computers, tablets, and other devices larger than cellphones aboard direct inbound flights. The Department of Homeland Security is also reportedly considering extending the ban to flights from Europe to the U.S.

Shedd said even if the broad contours of the laptop threat are publicly known, the president should be careful in revealing details related to it.
“Don’t confuse acting responsibly with authority,” Shedd said. “[Trump] has a responsibility like any president does to determine whether the information he wishes to release will have negative implications or a fallout. If you have a particular threat that pinpoints not just the fact of a laptop threat or something the [Transportation Security Administration] has already revealed, but add to it by saying [the threat] is out of this airport and this country, and this kind of airline, that starts to reveal the sourcing, or the method, or both. And that has consequences with how partners may share information in the future.”
3.) How Are the Rules for Declassifications and Disclosures Set?
The rules of classification are governed by an executive order—not by congressional statute—that is periodically updated by different presidents. The current version is Executive Order 13526, which Obama signed in 2009. Trump has not modified it yet.
Under the order, “original classification authorities,” such as the leaders of U.S. departments and agencies, can classify and declassify information “owned”—collected or received—by their organizations.
Those authorities can then permit the disclosure of the information to someone who has the proper security clearance and has a status that says they to “need to know” it. Because the president oversees all the agencies, he has full rights to these powers on his own.
Goitein said Obama’s executive order includes a section saying that when the U.S. obtains intelligence from a foreign partner, the American government should honor the restrictions the allied country puts on sharing the information.
“It also says in the executive order that an unauthorized disclosure of a foreign government’s intelligence is presumed to cause harm to [that country’s] national security,” Goitein said.
4.) How Does the US Rely on Other Countries for Intelligence?
John Hannah, senior counselor at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said intelligence cooperation with allied countries—known as “liaison relationships”—are essential to U.S. national security.
“These relationships are some of the crown jewels of the intelligence business,” said Hannah, who was Vice President Dick Cheney’s deputy national security adviser for the Middle East in the first term of the George W. Bush administration.
“We can’t do this alone,” Hannah told The Daily Signal in an interview. “We have huge amounts of capabilities, but particularly in some difficult target sets, there will be players who have unique advantages that are very important to us, particularly in terrorism cases, where it can be very hard to get inside information on the plotting of an operation.”
Hannah called Israel—the reported source of the information that Trump shared with Russia—the U.S.’ most important intelligence partner in the Middle East, with one of the “top five or six most capable” intelligence gathering operations in the world.
Ron Dermer, the Israeli ambassador to the United States, told The New York Times that the two countries would maintain a close counterterrorism relationship despite Trump’s disclosure to Russia.
“Israel has full confidence in our intelligence-sharing relationship with the United States and looks forward to deepening that relationship in the years ahead under President Trump,” Dermer said.
Hannah too maintained confidence in U.S.-partner relationships.
“If in fact an unauthorized compromise occurred, partners will be disappointed and could become more cautious in what they share,” Hannah said. “But at the end of the day, we are leaps and bounds the most capable intelligence service in the world, and the value-added we provide is tremendous. So the thought that this one incident—particularly if sources and methods were not compromised—would lead a country to rupture or fundamentally reassess its intelligence relationship with the U.S., I seriously doubt it. Our partners benefit too much from the reciprocal cooperation.”

"Army Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr., the top American commander in Afghanistan, greets U.S. and Afghan forces on April 29, 2017. (Photo: Staff/Reuters/Newscom)
In an early test of his foreign policy, President Donald Trump is facing a decision on whether to contribute thousands of additional U.S. troops to America’s longest-running—and often overlooked—war.
As first reported by The Washington Post, Trump’s senior military and foreign policy advisers recommend that the president send 3,000 to 5,000 more troops to bolster an existing U.S. force of 8,400 in Afghanistan and help that country’s government gain momentum in a 15-year war against the Taliban, the Islamist insurgent group.
Experts who study the Afghanistan War say the plan is designed to break a stalemate in the fighting, and to pressure the resurgent Taliban to negotiate a peace agreement with the Afghan government.
These experts, in interviews with The Daily Signal, say the proposed strategy does not represent a dramatic U.S. escalation to a war in which America once committed 100,000 troops.
But they say if Trump were to approve the plan—he’s expected to make a decision before a May 25 NATO meeting in Brussels—it would challenge the president’s evolving foreign policy doctrine. That doctrine has trended toward a narrow counterterrorism-first approach rather than deep commitments to overseas conflicts.
“My best guess is [Trump’s advisers] are looking to at least stop the bleeding in Afghanistan at the moment,” Bill Roggio, who edits the Foundation for Defense of Democracies’ Long War Journal, said in an interview with The Daily Signal. “They are also doing what they think they can get away with and what is politically acceptable. There is not a lot of support in the American public, and among members of Congress, for a significantly deeper U.S. commitment to the Afghanistan War.”
Roggio said he did not think the additional troops would fundamentally change the situation in Afghanistan, where more than 2,000 U.S. troops have died and another 20,000 have been wounded.
“The Taliban have had momentum for several years now,” Roggio said. “They have weathered a full surge of U.S. forces. The Afghan security forces have not been able to hold the gains. So I don’t think an incremental increase in troops will affect the situation all that much.”
‘Rise From the Dead’
Yet Roggio and others say an extra U.S. presence could reverse declines in the security situation in Afghanistan.
President Barack Obama, who had pledged to end U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan, steadily reduced the American role, but did not completely pull out troops due to a number of security challenges.
The Taliban is gaining territory. Reuters reports the Islamist group controls 40 percent of the country, and that casualties for government forces reached record levels last year. In addition, the terrorist group al-Qaeda has established new footholds in Afghanistan, the country it used to plan the 9/11 attacks. And ISIS also has established a small presence in Afghanistan.
“Afghanistan is not the only place, and even the most important place at any given time [for U.S. interests],” Michael O’Hanlon, director of the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution, said in an interview with The Daily Signal. “But as we have seen with the Taliban surge, and ISIS gaining a foothold there, it’s pretty clear this area has an ability to allow bad guys to rise from the dead. You want a sustained presence in Southeast Asia as the easternmost pillar in the counterterrorism capacity of the United States.”
‘Not a Surge’
Currently, American forces in Afghanistan have two primary missions: advising and training Afghan forces and conducting counterterrorism missions, including a recent raid that killed the leader of ISIS’ affiliate there, Abdul Hasib.
According to The New York Times, the new Trump administration plan would allow American advisers to assist a larger number of Afghan forces, and work closer to the front lines. Under the proposal, the U.S. would also not set a firm deadline for withdrawing troops, as Obama did.

“This is not a surge,” said James Jay Carafano, vice president for foreign and defense policy at The Heritage Foundation, who advised Trump’s transition team. “This is still going to be an Afghan-led thing.”
Carafano, a retired Army officer, added:
It’s not a dramatic expansion of the conflict where we go in there and say we will win once and for all. It’s about how we get to conditions on the ground that keep Afghanistan on a path to stability. That’s what’s driving the troop numbers.
Others say the Trump administration risks being stuck in a middle-ground position, with little realistic chance for new peace talks unless both sides make concessions.
The challenges for peace are exacerbated at a time when Afghanistan’s security leadership faces allegations of corruption, and the Taliban has shown little inclination to make concessions.
The Taliban also has been buffered by support from Iran and Russia, while Afghanistan’s neighbor, Pakistan, continues to provide a safe haven for militant groups.
Testifying before Congress in February, Army Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr., the top American commander in Afghanistan, called for a “holistic review” of policy toward and financial aid for Pakistan.
“It’s always been a close call on its merits, on whether it’s worth waging war in Afghanistan or not,” Stephen Biddle, a senior fellow for defense policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, said in an interview with The Daily Signal, adding:
You can still make a reasonable case for it and against it. I don’t think this is a hopeless situation. It’s not crazy to suppose we can get a compromise settlement. But that requires we get serious about this, which includes the Trump administration owning this process and expending political capital to build a constituency to support it.
Guarding Against ‘Catastrophic Events’
Rebecca Zimmerman, a policy researcher at RAND Corporation who focuses on Afghanistan, sought to downplay expectations for what an enhanced U.S. presence in the country could do.
She says U.S. support is most needed to prevent collapse of the Afghan government, which would make the country an ungoverned space to be exploited by extremist groups.
“The biggest threat to the U.S. is government collapse in Afghanistan,” Zimmerman told The Daily Signal. “If that happens, there is a likelihood of a multiparty civil war, and the countryside will be open to anyone who wants to plant a terrorist flag there. If we can support the Afghan forces to guard against catastrophic events that can fell the government, we would be using those troops effectively.”
With no near-term endgame, Roggio of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies says it’s fair to question whether the U.S. should continue to supply troops and funding — about $23 billion annually — to the Afghanistan War.
But he says walking away from Afghanistan would present immeasurable costs.
“It’s never wrong to question why we are still at war 15 years later,” Roggio said. “We should be asking hard questions about why we are sending service members to die. But it would be massive victory for jihadist groups across the world if the U.S. decided to pull out of Afghanistan.”

FARRELL, Pa.– Halfway between Cleveland and Pittsburgh, in a piece of middle America collectively known as Shenango Valley, stands a steel mill that dates back to the late 1800s.
Ed McMurray, 44, has spent nine years at the mill, NLMK USA, where he says he has worked “here, there, and everywhere,” spanning various components of steelmaking.
“Somebody has to do it,” says McMurray, covered head to toe in a hardhat, protective jacket, and workboots as he walks through the scalding hot rolling section of the mill, where flashes of fire transform massive slabs of steel into a thinner, more usable form.
The steelmaking operation during McMurray’s time at NLMK does not look like it used to.
Almost two decades ago, as the American steel industry evolved through competition, innovation, and technology, NLMK emerged from bankruptcies and ownership changes to alter its business model. The company outsourced to other countries the early part of the production process — the melting of raw materials such as iron ore into steel slabs.
NLMK’s unique business model has been mostly successful, and lucrative to McMurray — most employees here make six figures with benefits.
“The company has taken care of me,” says McMurray, as he reflects during a drive through a dirt yard near a railroad track, where 40,000 pound slabs of steel lie and wait to be transformed into steel coils for customers.
“I have given the company a good effort,” McMurray, a veteran of the Army and college graduate, tells The Daily Signal. “I have done what they ask me to do, plus whatever else.”

But NLMK has seen its bottom line suffer recently as a result of “Buy America” rules written into U.S. law that define what “made in America” means and prevent certain steel producers from participating in government-funded work.
Through a recent executive order, President Donald Trump has offered strong support for the Buy America policy, signaling his intent to strictly enforce the already-existing rules and apply it to his proposed $1 trillion infrastructure plan.
In anticipation of that executive order, signed April 18, steel mills such as NLMK that depend on imported steel — known in industry terms as “re-rollers” — increased their government lobbying efforts, worried that Trump could impose a more restrictive “Buy America” standard to other categories of government spending.
If this were to happen, to compete for lucrative government work NLMK would have to buy more expensive steel slabs domestically, and the supply isn’t readily available, company executives say.
McMurray, who was laid off for 13 weeks in 2009 when business was particularly bad, warns of the potential consequences.
“If the policies continue to where we can’t import the slabs, you won’t have layoffs,” he says. “You will have worse.”
The Trump administration declined The Daily Signal’s request for comment for this report.
‘Different Than Competitors’
Historically, most U.S. steel mills — including NLMK — were so-called integrated mills that combine and melt raw materials to produce their own slabs of steel.
NLMK, like other manufacturers, found it not cost effective to fabricate the steel on site — which requires maintaining a multimillion-dollar furnace to melt the steel.
So 18 years ago, NLMK began importing semi-finished steel slabs from other countries such as Russia and Brazil that have rich deposits of iron ore and coal, the raw materials that become steel. NLMK’s parent company is based in Russia (the acronym stands for Novolipetsk Steel).
“People who aren’t educated about the evolution of the steel industry don’t understand the jobs that went away, and this model that we and others adopted that put jobs back to work, and sustained jobs,” Bob Miller, NLMK’s sharply dressed president and CEO, tells The Daily Signal.
Under NLMK’s production model, the process starts at the railroad tracks on the mill property, where five trains per week arrive from the Port of Philadelphia carrying slabs of semi-finished steel that were produced overseas and delivered by boat.
A forklift-like slab hauler transports the steel into NLMK’s hot rolling mill. The process looks like a fire-powered, more explosive version of the rolling of dough.
The heat flattens the steel slab, reducing its thickness. The steel then moves to a pickling line, where an acid solution rinses the steel to remove stains and rust.
Next is a finishing unit, called a cold mill, which stretches and thins the steel some more.
Miller, 51, says the mill rolls 150,000 tons of steel slab per month.
“We’ve been successful,” Miller says. “Our whole business model is to be different than all of our competitors. So we outservice them. We outproduce them. We are nimble. We don’t have the layers, so customers can call and pick up the phone and talk to me.”

Defining ‘Made in America’
All of this work, as defined by law, does not qualify as being made in America.
The Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 placed domestic content requirements on federal grants that go to states and localities, mandating that various materials, such as steel, used for infrastructure projects must be “produced in the United States.”
Individual agencies within the Department of Transportation, such as the Federal Highway Administration, interpret the meaning of “produced in the United States” differently, but many agencies say steel must be “melted and poured” in America to qualify.
Under this definition, NLMK’s steel would not qualify because the mill does not have its own furnace to melt the steel, but instead imports already-melted slabs from overseas.
That means NLMK’s steel cannot be used in certain state and local infrastructure projects that are funded with federal grant money.
While government-funded work makes up less than 5 percent of the company’s business, Miller says the reverberations of the “melted and poured” standard have a deeper impact.
NLMK sells much of its steel to service centers — which are wholesalers — that then distribute the steel to end users.
These service centers can’t always predict what inventory will be used for projects funded with federal grants.

Jim Banker, NLMK’s executive vice president, says some customers are holding back on purchasing steel from his mill because they fear the government later could rule the steel doesn’t meet the American-made definition.
“We have customers proactively coming to us and saying we are getting nervous about buying from you,” Banker says. “Our customers’ customers are saying we need steel melted and poured in the U.S. That’s the threat we are getting. This is very real for us right now.”
In his April executive order, Trump affirms that the U.S. will promote steel “melted and poured” in America.
“Produced in the United States means, for iron and steel products, that all manufacturing processes, from the initial melting stage through the application of coatings, occurred in the United States,” the order reads.
In his first days in office, Trump also issued a memo calling for the “melted and poured” standard to be mandated for iron or steel products used in construction of U.S. oil pipelines.
By drawing explicit attention to the “melted and poured” standard, Miller and Banker fear, Trump will make these “Buy America” requirements more far-reaching, expanding their application into additional types of government-funded work.
The mill executives worry that by Trump’s bringing public attention to a little-known aspect of federal law, potential customers could be discouraged to buy from import-reliant manufacturers such as NLMK even when the rules don’t apply.
“How about the guy who is a patriot, and he happens to turn on Fox News and these executive orders are coming out and it’s the first time he is really hearing about ‘melted and poured,’” Miller says, adding:
He is a guy that buys our steel, but just kind feels like, ‘You know, we are going to do the right thing, we are going to make the country great again.’ And so he makes his own decision to lend his hand of support to [Trump], and he decides he won’t buy steel from us anymore because we can’t satisfy ‘melted and poured.’ That’s the collateral damage part of this.
Stricter Enforcement
While the “melted and poured” rules existed for decades before he became president, Trump says he intends to clamp down on loopholes that allow contractors to bypass the requirement.
For example, for projects funded by the Federal Highway Administration, contractors can ignore the made-in-America requirement in cases where complying increases the cost of the project by more than 25 percent.

There are other exemptions.
A 1979 law that codifies various U.S. trade deals, known as the Trade Agreements Act, gives the president the authority to waive domestic content requirements for products sourced from countries that have free trade agreements with America.
Trump’s executive order refers to the historic use of waivers like these as overly “judicious,” and calls for closer scrutiny in how they are applied to ensure “maximum utilization of goods, products, and materials produced in the United States.”
The order also calls for the Commerce Department and the U.S. trade representative to assess how America’s free trade agreements affect application of domestic content requirements.
‘Enforce Existing Law’
Steel industry and government contract experts say that all together, Trump’s actions so far amount to little substantive change in American policy.
“The April executive order doesn’t change any law,” Sandy Hoe, a government contracts attorney at Covington & Burling in Washington, D.C., says in an interview with The Daily Signal, explaining:
It is a lot like a lot of [Trump’s] executive orders in that it directs a study. It asks the secretary of commerce [Wilbur Ross] to explain what the department is doing to enforce existing law, so it puts the issue at a higher priority level.
Supporters of strong enforcement of domestic content requirements argue that these rules promote economic growth and create jobs in the U.S. steel industry.
The U.S. steel industry is relatively small. It employs about 140,000 people, or less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the American workforce.
Major American manufacturers in the industry, such as U.S. Steel, have lobbied for more restrictive Buy America provisions, arguing that American companies and workers should benefit from taxpayer-funded infrastructure projects such as those Trump says he intends to pursue.

U.S. Steel, the largest steel company in the country, operates as an integrated mill, meaning it produces its steel from start to finish in the U.S. using an on-site melting furnace.
So unlike NLMK, U.S. Steel satisfies “melted and poured” requirements.
“U.S. Steel finds President Trump’s executive action to be an encouraging development for American manufacturing,” Meghan Cox, the company’s manager of external communications, says in a statement to The Daily Signal. “Our company is proud to produce steel from start to finish in facilities across America. A strong domestic steel industry is at the foundation of America’s economic and national security.”
Kevin Dempsey, senior vice president of policy at the American Iron and Steel Institute, contends that strong Buy America rules encourage further production in the U.S. In an interview with The Daily Signal, Dempsey says steel manufacturers that produce their entire product here should get unique treatment because they take on greater costs.
Dempsey interprets Trump’s executive order as a status quo commitment to keep the Buy America rules as they are.
“The vast majority of expense and investment and fine tuning required to make steel is in the initial melting processes, where you are are creating the initial raw steel,” Dempsey says, adding:
What Trump is doing is coming out firmly in support of the majority of the steel industry that wants to keep the law as it’s been. There are companies like NLMK that are actively seeking to get a change in how Buy America rules apply to make their imported-slab product qualify. Our concern is if you treat a product that is partially made elsewhere as made in America, you are disincentivizing further steel investment in the U.S.
‘Made in the USA’
But some industry experts argue that made-in-America requirements distort the marketplace, disrupt supply chains, and elevate certain manufacturers over others simply because of the business model they choose to use.
Dan Ikenson, director of the trade policy center at the libertarian Cato Institute, says imposing more restrictive Buy America provisions could force customers to stop buying from companies such as NLMK, and choose higher-priced alternatives. That could increase the costs of infrastructure projects.
“If you don’t care about reading the fine print and just read the slogan, made-in-America provisions sound pretty darn patriotic,” Ikenson says, adding:
But the fact is, if you put a premium on this idea of starting and building everything from scratch in the U.S., there is a lot of collateral damage. What it ends up doing is prescribing what your supply chain should be — to do it in a less efficient manner. Economically, the most efficient way to run your business may be option A, but A will disqualify you, so you go to option B, which is inefficient.
Miller, of NLMK, says changing his business model is not feasible. Buying steel slabs domestically would be costly, because of the limited supply here, he says.
And he predicts “there will never be another blast furnace built in the U.S.” because of the expense, so his mill won’t be melting its own steel anytime soon.
As he describes the different components of his on-site steel operation — offloading steel slabs off rail cars, managing the slab yard, heating and cooling slabs into finished coil — he reminds a visitor that each step depends on the same thing: American workers.
“We are made in the U.S.A.,” Miller says. “With all we built here, we’ll manage to survive.”

"Coos County, New Hampshire, has the highest combined death rate due to drugs, alcohol, or suicide in all of New England. (Photo: Bastiaan Slabbers

COLEBROOK, N.H.—Sally Zankowski is who comes when it’s too late. She’s there to define, investigate—and make sense of—another sudden death owed to opioid overdose in New Hampshire’s poorest and most remote county.
Zankowski, 55, is the medical examiner for Coos County, which has the highest combined death rate due to drugs, alcohol, or suicide in all of New England.
Of the death she encounters in the vast, sparsely populated region she covers, the cause is usually easy to determine.

Part 5 of 5: The First Responders Who Witness a Dreadful Toll
An elderly person has died from natural causes, while asleep in bed. A sick, deteriorating person has lost his battle with cancer, a day that both he and his family knew was coming. Autopsies are unnecessary.
“More often than not, we can say these are expected deaths,” Zankowski tells The Daily Signal. “You write a one-page paper, follow up with funeral home, hospital, and family. You sign a death certificate, and off we go.”
“What gets a medical examiner really involved is an accidental or unexpected death,” adds Zankowski, who is officially known as the assistant deputy medical examiner for Coos County and parts of neighboring Grafton County.
Lately, Zankowski has been investing herself in these kind of deaths—out-of-the-blue, hard-to-figure overdoses related to opioids, whether prescribed painkillers, heroin, fentanyl, or a mixture of some or all.
Indiscriminate and persistent, these deaths puzzle, frustrate, sadden, anger, and overwhelm.
“One of the things we have heard over the years is the epidemic with opioid drugs crosses all boundaries—socioeconomic, age, sex, race, it doesn’t matter—and that has been slammed in my face,” Zankowski says. “I can’t figure it out.”
‘End of the World’
As Coos County, like America, grapples with an epidemic of opioid addiction and seeks solutions to slow its fury, Zankowski drives for answers in preventing the ultimate consequence of this drug crisis: death.
For suspected fatal overdoses, Zankowski, a longtime Coos County resident in her fifth year as medical examiner here, must decide if an autopsy should be done to determine for certain a death’s cause and manner.

She makes this decision in conjunction with physicians from the state’s Office of the Chief Medical Examiner and Coos County Attorney John McCormick. Next of kin may request an autopsy, but officials may authorize the procedure without the family’s permission.
Autopsies, conducted by specialized doctors known as pathologists, are surgical procedures that consist of making external examinations, removing and dissecting organs, and collecting samples for tests.
The National Association of Medical Examiners recommends autopsies for all overdoses.
Zankowski says that in Coos County, most suspected drug-related deaths result in autopsies because the cases could involve criminal activity and the results are helpful for prosecution.
The autopsies usually confirm what Zankowski’s trained eyes can see.
In the 10 years prior to her becoming medical examiner, Zankowski was an emergency room nurse at Upper Connecticut Valley Hospital in Colebrook, a town of 2,300 in Coos County.
On any given day, she says, at least some of the hospital’s 10 or fewer beds were occupied by drug users.

New Hampshire’s medical examiners don’t have to be physicians. So Zankowski thought her familiarity with drug-related trauma in the emergency room—which didn’t always lead to death—prepared her well for the real thing:
My entire life, I remember statistics and people related to drug addiction because the population here is so small. Up here, you are at the end of the world. When they die, I rarely encounter someone who I at least don’t recognize by family name. Yet still, I am surprised time after time—for the young, middle-aged, whatever—that drugs are involved with the death.
‘Prepare for What I Will See’
For Zankowski, surprise really means “it’s hard to believe this keeps happening.”
Because the drug-related scenes are beginning to look similar, with the same unsatisfying ending.
Zankowski’s job starts when she gets a call from the police—local or state, and many towns in Coos don’t have police departments—who alert her to a death.
Sometimes Zankowski is far away from the scene. It can take her an hour and a half to drive through her coverage area.
Coos is the largest county in New Hampshire by land area, 1,830 square miles—containing numerous tiny towns spread far apart—and the smallest by population. Its 33,000 residents represent less than 3 percent of the state.

Typically, Zankowski arrives at a house. She will make her way to a bedroom, often upstairs. The furnishings are sparse. Sometimes the bed is a mattress on the floor.
“These are people who have often lost everything they have,” Zankowski says. “It’s not like a nice bedroom.”
In “numerous cases,” she says, a child of the dead person finds the body.
When she encounters the body for herself, on the bed or on the floor, Zankowski first looks for signs of drug use: lighters, spoons, straws, powder, pill bottles, syringes, alcohol, or needles—sometimes still stuck in the arm.
“Inherently, we all stereotype to some degree, and I hate to, but the more that I can paint a typical picture and put it into a category, the better I prepare myself for what I will see,” Zankowski says.
‘Closure From Me’
Zankowski also reaches to learn more than the visible characteristics and facts of the case.
She wants to know the context, an exercise that she hopes brings understanding, and potentially closure, to both herself and the surviving family.
Zankowski interviews family members and invests in their lives by connecting them with churches or health clinics that can help with recovery from loss.
“It’s so shocking, because you talk to the family, who are not being mistrustful to me,” Zankowski says. “They are passing on what they know to the best of their knowledge. They say, I know he’s been straight, he wants to get better. I read his diary. He’s gaining weight. He’s eating. I know he’s healthy—I see his eyes. And then they fall off the wagon. It’s very upsetting.”

Part 4: Police Assault on Opioids Gets Boost From a Family Doctor 
Part 5: The First Responders Who Witness a Dreadful Toll
Some families don’t want to talk with Zankowski. To make herself relatable, she dresses normally, without a uniform. She’s not numb to death. She may lose her composure and cry:
If you act like a human being, and show those emotions, you are well received. I have never felt that I was a disadvantage to the situation. I would think I would be perceived as—I don’t want to say the bad guy—but for the medical examiner to be involved, this is a very dark scenario. I am amazed families are able to take some good from it, and maybe they get closure from me.
‘The Last Stop’
Michael Pearson responds to death in a different way. As the managing director of Jenkins & Newman Funeral Home in Colebrook, death is his business.
“In this business, we are the last stop,” Pearson says. “We are what happens when the system fails.”
Pearson, 49, whose tall stature and serious demeanor befit his heavy job, arrives at scenes of all deaths to collect the body and prepare it for burial or cremation.
“There are decisions to be made: How are people to be disposed of, are they gonna be buried, are they gonna be cremated, who’s gonna pay the bill,” Pearson says. “I have to deal with who is left behind, even while I am getting the body.”

Like Zankowski, Pearson is struck by the familiarity of death by opioid overdose.
“I know from the first call, usually, what I am going to,” Pearson says. “In most opioid overdoses, tests take several weeks to confirm the cause of death. But it’s fairly obvious what the cause was.”
Jenkins & Newman Funeral Home, which Pearson has run for 15 years, covers Colebrook and a few surrounding towns, with a total population of about 8,000.
Pearson lives where he works, off Colebrook’s Main Street, in a residential-looking building where the first floor is his office and the second his living quarters.
He was born in Coos County, and has raised a family here. He says he tries to insulate his own children—a son and daughter—from the opioid crisis. His 20-year-old son, the eldest, is in the Navy.
“I am not worried about him—he would not go anywhere near this stuff,” Pearson says.
Pearson empathizes with the dead. But because he interacts with survivors in a transactional manner, Pearson is especially attentive to the ripple effect of a life lost to drug addiction.
“We get to see the whole drag that this is on families, society, the area, the economy,” Pearson says. “Most of these people can’t pay my bill. So it’s a drag on my business.”
“It’s tragic,” Pearson adds:
I don’t understand addiction and stuff like that. If it is a disease and a sickness, we have to learn how to get a hold of it. These people don’t know what they are doing. They don’t know what they are doing to everyone they’ve left behind. It’s over for them. So they don’t care. But the rest of us are like, ‘I shouldn’t be here.’ It’s a bad problem. I don’t know how to solve the problem.
Related by Addiction
Down the road from Jenkins & Newman Funeral Home is a cash-only, family-run pizza restaurant, fittingly named Colebrook House of Pizza.
Inside, Bonnie Hammond, 56, a waitress who is a lifetime Coos County resident, is recalling—without being asked—her relation to the opioid addiction crisis.
Her stepson, Jason Wood, was addicted to drugs and alcohol. At 18, Wood enlisted in the Air Force to escape his addiction, which began a few years after his first sip of alcohol as a 12-year-old.

Stationed in Alaska as a munitions specialist, Wood came home worse. He took antidepressants and, eventually, opioid painkillers and became addicted to them. He left the Air Force with an honorable discharge, Hammond says.
Addiction was in Wood’s blood, Hammond says. His biological father, who Wood did not have a relationship with, died of a drug overdose two years ago, and his mother has battled substance abuse issues.
Hammond’s husband, Stanley, is not Wood’s biological father. But he was once married to Wood’s mother, and raised Wood since he was 1 years old. So Wood considered Stanley his father figure, and Hammond, his step mother.
Back in Colebrook after the military, Wood hit his low point. Someone had stolen money from Hammond, she wrote to friends on Facebook. Wood quickly wrote back, fessing up to being the culprit. Hammond filed a police report accusing him.
Hammond and Wood forgave each other, and he went to rehab. He moved in with Hammond and Stanley—who do not have biological children of their own—and away from his biological mother.
Wood settled into an upstairs bedroom in Hammond’s home and tried to take advantage of Coos County’s natural gifts, spending time outside fishing, snowboarding, and four-wheeling.
But his addiction hampered him, its symptoms easy to see and hard to overcome.
“He always sweated so bad because his organs were working so hard,” Hammond says. “He tried working and doing things outside, but he’d have to come home and change his clothes a couple times a day because he was so soaked.”
Hammond tried to help, but she felt caught between caring for her stepson and challenging him.
“You enable because it’s your kid,” Hammond says. “I knew my stepson was overly medicated. I knew it was dangerous. But he said he would die without the drugs.”
On a Monday morning, Nov. 19, 2012, Hammond entered Wood’s bedroom, to fetch Stanley’s truck keys. Her stepson had not been answering his cellphone.
Before she could locate the keys, Hammond found Wood slumped over, his body lodged in the foot of space between his bed and the wall behind it.
“I knew he was gone,” Hammond says of her stepson, who was 23. “Jason said he didn’t want to live that way anymore. He wanted to know what it was like to be normal, because it had been so long. Now he knows what it’s like to be normal. Now that he’s dead. Now that he’s up there in heaven, he must be normal and not heavily medicated.”

Pearson, the Colebrook funeral director who works down the street from the pizza shop where Hammond waits tables, recalls the scene similarly.
He responded to Wood’s death, published an obituary, and cremated the body.
The obituary says that Wood died “unexpectedly,” but the cause was clear.
“That’s coming back to me,” Pearson says, when reminded of Wood’s death. “I remember this kid. I’ve been to the pizza restaurant.”
Pearson recounts how removing Wood’s body was difficult: It was sweaty as he put it into a body bag. He had to carry the body down steep stairs to get back outside.
Hammond lived—and Wood died—about 100 yards from the local hospital where Zankowski, the medical examiner, used to work.
Coos County’s opioid drug epidemic had come full circle.
It was too late.
“The kid’s parents were very devastated by the whole thing,” Pearson says. “They thought he was getting better. He relapsed. He was in his early 20s, and he is gone forever. He was addicted to drugs, and it killed him.”

"The MS-13 gang was originally born on the streets of Los Angeles, but arrived in El Salvador in the early 1990s as many of its ranks were being deported back to their home country by the U.S. government. (Photo: Adriana Zehbrauskas/Polaris/Newscom)
In describing its effort to enforce immigration laws aggressively, the Trump administration repeatedly has invoked the threat of MS-13, a violent international gang with ties to Central America.
The Democrats don't want money from budget going to border wall despite the fact that it will stop drugs and very bad MS 13 gang members.
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 23, 2017

Responding to a recent surge of violence linked to MS-13 on Long Island, New York—punctuated by the April 13 discovery of four men killed near a public park—U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions visited with local law enforcement late last month, and vowed to eradicate the gang by cracking down on illegal immigration.
“The MS-13 motto is kill, rape, and control,” Sessions said at the U.S. Courthouse on Long Island. “Our motto is justice for victims and consequences for criminals. That’s how simple it is. Prosecute them, and after they’ve been convicted, if they’re not here lawfully, they’re going to be deported.”
In interviews with The Daily Signal, law enforcement experts who study MS-13—and have been working to help combat it—welcomed President Donald Trump’s tough approach to the gang, but cautioned that the federal government should not lose sight of other violent gangs with footprints in the U.S.
According to the FBI’s most recent statistics, there are about 33,000 active gangs in the U.S., with about 1.4 million members.
“The threat of MS-13 and their violence is real enough, but they are not the only gang in town,” said Wes McBride, the executive director of the California Gang Investigators Association, in an interview with The Daily Signal.
Experts such as McBride, who served 28 years in the gang unit of the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Office, say that immigration enforcement is only one element of a strategy that the U.S. has waged for decades against MS-13.
“People tend to talk about MS-13 as a gang of illegals, and it sort of is, but a lot of them now were born here, so they are second generation,” McBride said. “This is a long-term problem without a simple solution.”
‘Fertile for Gang Proliferation’
Mara Salvatrucha, known as MS-13, originated in Los Angeles in the 1980s, when thousands of people from El Salvador, a country of Central America’s northern triangle, fled civil war.
A 2008 Congressional Research Service report describes MS-13’s early membership as consisting of former guerillas and El Salvadoran government soldiers with combat experience. Those initial members helped the gang develop a reputation of using unusual methods of violence—most prominently, its choice of machetes as a murder weapon.

Eric Olson, the associate director of the Latin America program at the Wilson Center, said the new arrivals from El Salvador formed MS-13 as a form of self-preservation to compete with other Los Angeles-based gangs.
“The Salvadorans were suddenly confronted with Mexican gangs in the high schools, and African-American gangs, so almost as a self-protection thing, they formed cliques and gangs,” Olson told The Daily Signal.
Olson and other experts say MS-13 expanded when, in the mid-1990s, the U.S. government changed immigration law to hasten deportation of the gang’s members back to El Salvador.
MS-13 became the first street gang to be labeled a “transnational criminal organization”—one that operates internationally—by the U.S. government.
“While many of the gang members eventually got deported, they had to reconfigure themselves in El Salvador, and so you had a very vulnerable population fall back on their larger gang family [there] as a protection mechanism,” Olson said. “MS-13 became bigger and more powerful in El Salvador.”
Nelson Arriaga, president of the International Latino Gang Investigators Association, which provides training to law enforcement conducting anti-gang operations, says the U.S. government did not give proper support to Salvadoran authorities who were ill-equipped to handle the return of their troubled nationals.
“Law enforcement in Central America were completely oblivious to the criminal element being exported from the U.S. to those countries, and to the level of sophistication gang members were bringing with them,” Arriaga told The Daily Signal in an interview.
“Those countries were fertile for gang proliferation.”
As MS-13 grew its ranks from deportees returning from the U.S. to El Salvador, members also migrated back to the U.S.
“When we started deporting them, some would turn around and come right back,” McBride said. “It became a circular problem.”
Enforcement Crackdown
Today, the Justice Department estimates that MS-13 has roughly 30,000 members worldwide and more than 10,000 in the U.S. MS-13 is active in 40 states plus the District of Columbia, the department estimates, with an especially significant presence on the East Coast, in New York, Virginia, and Maryland.
While Trump has blamed the Obama administration’s less strict immigration policies for MS-13’s growth, a Justice Department fact sheet, dated April 18, credits “great progress made” by federal, state, and local law enforcement in “diminishing” and disrupting the gang’s impact during 2009 and 2010.
Indeed, McBride says he does not blame the Obama administration for the spread of MS-13. The California gang expert notes that President Barack Obama’s Treasury Department in 2012 sanctioned the gang as a transnational criminal organization.
In January 2016, the Justice Department indicted 56 MS-13 members in the Boston area on federal racketeering conspiracy charges, some related to murder, conspiracy to commit murder, attempted murder, and drug trafficking. In March of this year, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York indicted more than a dozen MS-13 members in seven killings on Long Island spanning three years, including the deaths of several high school students last year.
The FBI started an MS-13 National Gang Task Force in 2004 to coordinate the investigative efforts of federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies against the gang.
Arriaga, a retired sergeant in the Inglewood Police Department who focused on gangs, says the FBI and U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents today are embedded in Central America to help local police in those countries deal with the MS-13 threat.
“The MS-13 threat in Central America is on steroids compared to the threat here,” Arriaga said. “It’s good to see the Trump administration making greater emphasis of MS-13, but the enforcement aspect of this has already been there.”
Threat ‘Stays Here’
Despite these efforts, law enforcement experts acknowledge that MS-13 remains strong.
Gang members in the U.S. have preyed on recent arrivals from Central America, many of them teenagers who traveled here alone in a surge of illegal immigration from El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala over the past few years.
“The best way to tackle the problem is to convince young people to stay away from the gangs,” Sessions said during his April 28 speech in Long Island.
While MS-13, which has a decentralized structure with little coordination, is not considered a major player in international drug smuggling, Olson said, the gang uses extortion to control local drug markets.
“Extortion is really their bread and butter, so if you are in a poor neighborhood and your job isn’t paying enough, or you don’t have a job and sell tortillas on the corner, [MS-13] force you to pay a tax,” Olson said. “They are extorting all economic activity. Their control of legal markets and extortion is absolute. And when they are in conflict with one another and the police, they become extraordinarily violent.”
Olson called for a multipronged strategy to defeat MS-13:
It’s not like removing a tumor, where you can cut it out and it’s gone. It stays here. Anti-gang work in the U.S. and in Central America needs to go way beyond simply trying to deport and incarcerate people. I wouldn’t say border security won’t have any impact. It’s already had a big impact. It’s one element of an overall challenge.

"Leif Olson abruptly left the Labor Department 18 days after joining the federal government. The departure came after reporter Ben Penn contacted the White House and Labor Department about what he portrayed as an anti-Semitic Facebook post from 2016. (Photo: Alastair Pike/AFP/Getty Images)
The Department of Labor reinstated a political appointee Wednesday night who resigned under pressure after a Bloomberg Law reporter accused him of anti-Semitism for a Facebook post in which he was actually condemning anti-Semites in the alt-right, the Daily Caller News Foundation exclusively learned.
Acting Secretary Patrick Pizzella “personally made this decision after carefully reviewing all the facts and circumstances,” a senior Labor Department official told the DCNF. “He concluded that a correction is much better than an injustice.”
Leif Olson abruptly left the department 18 days after joining the federal government, after moving his family from Texas to take the job. The departure came after Bloomberg Law reporter Ben Penn contacted the White House and Labor Department about what he portrayed as an anti-Semitic Facebook post from 2016. Penn cropped out in a Tuesday article portions of the exchange that directly referenced it being “epic sarcasm.”
“On Friday, August 30, 2019, senior policy advisor of the Wage and Hour Division Leif Olson offered his resignation and the department accepted,” the department said in a statement to the DCNF. “Following a thorough reexamination of the available information and upon reflection, the department has concluded that Olson has satisfactorily explained the tone and content of his sarcastic social media post and will return to his position.”
“What makes this one remarkable is that Olson’s Facebook page was public to his non-friends. Any cursory screening of his social media accounts could’ve uncovered the anti-Semitism,” Penn tweeted.
This is the latest in a series of mishaps under the Trump administration personnel vetting system. What makes this one remarkable is that Olson's Facebook page was public to his non-friends. Any cursory screening of his social media accounts could've uncovered the anti-Semitism.
A cursory reading of the post showed it to be a condemnation of anti-Semitism and conspiracies on the far-right, coming from the standpoint of the center-right.
Olson resigned within four hours of Penn emailing government officials about the post. It is unclear whether Olson’s supervisor, head of the Wage and Hour Division Cheryl Stanton, pressured him to resign and why the resignation was accepted.
Political pundits across the spectrum condemned Bloomberg and encouraged the Labor Department to reinstate Olson.
Liberal site Vox published a story titled: “How mocking anti-Semitism got a Trump official falsely accused of actual anti-Semitism. You don’t have to agree with Leif Olson’s politics to think this situation is ridiculous.”
Washington Post media critic Erik Wemple wrote there was no “excuse for Bloomberg Law reporter Ben Penn. … Those ‘anti-Semitic’ posts are plainly sarcastic, rendering them not anti-Semitic.”
Bloomberg quoted Jake Hyman, a spokesman for the Anti-Defamation League, saying, “The post in question is clearly anti-Semitic.” It’s unclear whether ADL looked into the matter. “We appreciate Mr. Olson’s clarification that he intended to be sarcastic with his posts and accept his explanation of the content in question,” ADL said after an inquiry from the Post.
Olson wrote a public Facebook post in August 2016 mocking Paul Nehlen, an anti-Semitic, alt-right candidate who challenged then-House Speaker Paul Ryan in the Wisconsin Republican primary. It said, “Establishment insider RINO corporate tool Paul Ryan was finally brought to heel in tonight’s primary election. … The guy just suffered a massive, historic, emasculating 70-point victory.”
Since the opposite happened — Ryan trounced Nehlen in a landslide — everything that followed could only be read as tongue-in-cheek.
When a Facebook user played along with the sarcasm, saying Ryan is “a Jew. Everyone knows that,” Olson responded, “It must be true because I’ve never seen the Lamestream Media report it, and you know they protect their own.”
Penn apparently misinterpreted a comically exaggerated version of the far-right’s heated language to be the way a Trump appointee genuinely spoke.
(Screenshot: Facebook via Daily Caller News Foundation)
Penn quoted Olson explaining that “It was sarcastic criticism of the alt-right’s conspiracy theories and anti-Semitic positions,” but still referred to the post as anti-Semitic.
Penn used it to paint a narrative about the Trump administration, tweeting, “This is the latest in a series of mishaps under the Trump administration personnel vetting system.”
Bloomberg declined to retract the story, in part citing that Olson was no longer working at the department as an admission of guilt.
“We stand behind our reporting,” spokesman David Peikin told the Post. “We contacted the White House and the Department of Labor asking for comment on Mr. Olson’s Facebook posts. Within four hours, the Department of Labor responded that Mr. Olson had resigned.”

"Broward County Supervisor of elections Brenda Snipes answers reporter's questions about a possible recount from the midterm election on Nov. 8, 2018. (Photo: Carline Jean/TNS/Newscom) 
As both parties scrutinize the vote count in Florida’s Broward County, with the state’s gubernatorial and senatorial races closing in on a tie, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said the county’s elections office has a history of malfeasance.
“This is at a minimum a pattern of incompetence. Voters deserve better,” the Florida Republican said Thursday on “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” “This is not even a partisan thing. This is a county that apparently cannot even count votes as well as a county that just got wiped out by a hurricane.”

The state’s Republican Gov. Rick Scott filed a lawsuit Thursday against Broward Elections Supervisor Brenda Snipes for allegedly refusing to tell them about votes she has not yet counted.
The vote totals Snipes tabulated two days after the election would have readers believe that more people cast votes for agricultural commissioner than for U.S. senator.
OMG. Looking at county-level undervote. Broward stands out for having 3.7% of its ballots left blank for #FLSENbut cast for #FLGOV. No other county comes close, and Palm/Dade had more votes for Senator. Either this is ballot design or machine error. #flapol#sayfiepic.twitter.com/OtyK0oO20g

"The possible crimes committed by Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., include “perjury, immigration fraud, marriage fraud, state and federal tax fraud, and federal student loan fraud,” according to the complaint filed Tuesday by Judicial Watch’s Tom Fitton. Pictured: Omar participates in a panel discussion during the Muslim Collective for Equitable Democracy Conference and Presidential Forum on July 23 in Washington, D.C. (Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)
Conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch filed a complaint with the House of Representatives’ ethics office asking for an investigation into possible crimes committed by Minnesota Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar.
The possible crimes include “perjury, immigration fraud, marriage fraud, state and federal tax fraud, and federal student loan fraud,” according to the complaint filed Tuesday by Judicial Watch’s Tom Fitton.
“The House of Representatives must urgently investigate and resolve the serious allegations of wrongdoing by Rep. Omar,” Fitton said.
“Substantial, compelling and, to date, unrefuted evidence” supports the allegations, he said. 
The evidence developed against Rep. Omar was the result of a three-year-long investigation in both the United States and the United Kingdom by Mr. Steinberg and his investigative reporter colleagues Preya Samsundar and Scott Johnson. It is supported by information gathered from public records, social media postings, genealogy databases, computer forensic analysis, unaltered digital photographs, discussions between the investigative reporters and the subjects of the investigation themselves, and information supplied by confidential sources within the Somali-American community.
“Documented-based reporting by Steinberg, et al. has developed the following information: Rep. Ilhan Abdullahi Omar, a citizen of the United States, married her biological brother, Ahmed Nur Said Elmi, a citizen of the United Kingdom, in 2009, presumably as part of an immigration fraud scheme. The couple legally divorced in 2017,” Fitton wrote.
Omar gave birth to children fathered by another man, Ahmed Hirsi, both before and during her marriage to Elmi. Legal documents such as speeding tickets demonstrate that she lived with Hirsi during the entirety of her marriage to Elmi.
Omar requested a “default” divorce from Elmi in 2017, an unusual proceeding used where one spouse has disappeared and cannot be located. 
To obtain a divorce, Omar filed papers with the Minnesota district court swearing under penalty of perjury that she last saw him in 2011 and had no clues about how to contact him through other people.
She swore that she didn’t know the name of a single member of her husband’s family, and that they didn’t have any friends or acquaintances in common who might know how to locate him, according to papers she filed with the Minnesota district court to secure a divorce. 
She swore she tried to locate him through social media but could not, even though he had public profiles on Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn. Screenshots additionally show Omar continuously interacting with him on social media in the years since.
“The evidence developed by Mr. Steinberg and his colleagues demonstrates with a high degree of certainty that Ms. Omar not only had contact with Mr. Elmi, but actually met up with him in London in 2015, which is supported by photographic evidence,” Judicial Watch’s complaint says.
Of particular importance are archived photographs taken during a widely reported trip by Ilhan Omar to London in 2015, posted to her own Instagram account under her nickname ‘hameey,’ in which she poses with her husband/presumed brother, Ahmed Elmi. These photographs from 2015 are documentary evidence that in fact she met up with Mr. Elmi after June 2011 and before the date she signed the divorce document in August 2017, thereby calling into question the veracity of her claim that she had not seen Mr. Elmi since June 2011.
In Instagram screenshots, published by Powerline and conservative outlet Alpha News, and which appear to have been deleted, the two men are sometimes pictured together, and Elmi refers to Omar’s children as his “nieces.” 
(The Daily Caller News Foundation has observed other social media posts published by [David] Steinberg and determined they were authentic and online at the time of publication. They were deleted soon after the article called attention to them.)
Lying on a sworn form is perjury and each charge carries five years in prison, according to Minnesota law. Questions have been raised about the accuracy of approximately six statements on the sworn form.
The substance of the reporting by Steinberg, Samsundar, and Johnson has largely been ignored by the media, but not refuted. 
The journalists “have engaged in meticulous research and reporting over a period of years. They have demonstrated with a high degree of probability that Rep. Ilhan Omar has violated House Ethics Rules, federal, and state laws,” Fitton said.
Omar was fined by the Minnesota Campaign Finance and Public Disclosure Board for using campaign funds to pay for an accountant to amend her taxes after she filed taxes jointly with Hirsi while she was not married to him (filing joint taxes with a non-spouse is not permitted) and while she was actually married to another man.
Under federal law 26 U.S. Code & 7206.1: 
Any person who willfully makes and subscribes any return, statement, or other document, which contains or is verified by a written declaration that it is made under the penalties of perjury, and which he does not believe to be true and correct as to every material matter … shall be guilty of a felony and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than $100,000 … or imprisoned not more than 3 years, or both, together with the costs of prosecution.
Fitton said investigators must examine Omar’s tax returns for other falsifications.
Fitton said the apparent sham marriage may have been motivated by student loan fraud as well as making it easier for Elmi to immigrate to the U.S. Elmi had British citizenship when he came from London, married Omar, and enrolled in North Dakota State University with her, Omar has said.
Despite Omar saying her short-lived husband was long-lost, he can be tied even this year to other members of Omar’s family. 
Omar’s sister Sahra Noor, who ran a high-profile nonprofit in Minnesota, this year created a new consultancy in Kenya. Elmi, who works in digital media, appears to have created its Instagram account. Code discovered by Steinberg shows that Elmi’s name is in the source code of the website.
“She’s been unwilling to address any of these questions,” Kevin Diaz, the editor of the Star Tribune, told PolitiFact. “There was an undisputed instance of her filing her taxes improperly. And if you’re in Congress, you should explain that to your constituents.”
Judicial Watch wrote to the Office of Congressional Ethics: “We call upon the Office of Congressional Ethics to launch an investigation into Rep. Omar’s conduct immediately.”
The Office of Congressional Ethics is comprised of non-congressmen who intake complaints and, if they deem the complaints strong, publicly refer them to the House Committee on Ethics.
“Democrats don’t file ethics complaints against Republicans and vice versa because you don’t want the tables turned,” an expert on Congress with the liberal group Demand Progress, Daniel Schuman, told The Daily Caller News Foundation. “They used to call it a Cold War detente: You don’t nuke the Russians and they don’t nuke you.”
Omar’s office did not respond to The Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment in time for publication.
Editor’s note: Omar has previously denied being married to her brother. The Associated Press reported last year that Omar “has denounced claims that she married her brother and committed immigration fraud as ‘disgusting lies.'”

"Then-Virginia Gov.-elect Ralph Northam greets supporters at an election night rally Nov. 7, 2017, in Fairfax, Virginia. Recently, Northam announced proposed legislation to repeal the state’s requirement that voters show photo ID. (Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images)
Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam on Monday announced proposed legislation to repeal the state’s requirement that voters show photo ID.
“Participation makes our democracy strong—we should encourage every eligible voter to exercise this fundamental right, rather than creating unnecessary barriers that make getting to the ballot box difficult,” Northam, a Democrat, said in a statement.

Delegate Kaye Kory, a sponsor of the measure, said in a statement, “The photo ID requirement prevents the most vulnerable Virginians from voting and silences the voices of those who most need to be heard.”
The proposal would also allow people to vote absentee without providing a reason why they could not make it to the polls.
Democrat Terry McAuliffe beat Republican Ken Cuccinelli for the Virginia governorship in 2013 by only 56,000 votes. In 2014, Democrat Mark Warner squeaked by against Republican Ed Gillespie in a Senate race decided by less than a percentage point, or 18,000 votes. The attorney general’s race came down to a mere 165 votes.
Then, just before the 2016 election, McAuliffe restored the right to vote for 60,000 felons using an unorthodox procedure.
McAuliffe had sought to allow all of Virginia’s estimated 200,000 felons to vote, but state courts said each individual felon’s circumstances must be weighed. To get around that, McAuliffe used a mechanical autopen to rapidly sign at least 60,000 letters as if he had personally reviewed them each.
McAuliffe is a close friend of Bill and Hillary Clinton who managed Hillary Clinton’s 2008 bid for president.
In the next race for governor in 2017, Northam beat Gillespie decisively by 9 percentage points, or 233,000 votes. In the 2016 presidential election, Clinton beat Donald Trump in Virginia 49.7 percent to 44.4 percent.
In the November 2018 elections, Florida voters passed a ballot measure that restored voting rights to the state’s 1.5 million felons.
Florida’s political parties have historically been so evenly matched that multiple statewide races went to recounts in 2018. Florida has a large number of Electoral College votes, and in 2000, the U.S. presidency infamously hung in the balance as Florida conducted a contentious recount.
In California, another novel electoral procedure, called ballot harvesting, decimated the GOP in Southern California.
“California just defies logic to me,” then-House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, said. “We were only down 26 seats the night of the election, and three weeks later, we lost basically every California contested race.”
Ballot harvesting allows groups to send people knocking on doors and eliciting absentee ballots from them, which the groups then collect and submit.
One ballot harvester was recorded saying it’s a “new service” for “like, people who are supporting the Democratic Party.”
Before its passage, a group opposed to the bill wrote that the law enabling ballot harvesting “would allow anybody to walk into an elections office and hand over truckloads of vote by mail envelopes with ballots inside, no questions asked, no verified records kept. It amounts to an open invitation to large-scale vote buying, voter coercion, ‘granny farming,’ and automated forgery.”

"The government held a meditation conference at a luxury retreat in California where the “whole government” was planning on coming, and it occurred during the longest government shutdown in history. (Photo: 
Halfpoint Images/Getty Images)
The federal government hosted a “Mindfulness & Resiliency Summit” in August where 450 employees from the IRS and other agencies spent two days receiving new-age wisdom, learning to meditate, and receiving on-site massages, photos of the event and a website show.
Participants sat through an hour of talks before taking a half-hour “stretch and self-care break.” Next, they heard a 90-minute talk from Gretchen Rohr, an activist working for George Soros’ Open Society Foundations who presented about “restorative justice” and overcoming “trauma,” according to a schedule obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation.
Then they adjourned for a two-hour lunch and returned for two hours of advice from Ashanti Branch, who teaches “young men of color” to “hold safe space.” He presented a bizarrely capitalized PowerPoint that included lines such as “the Longest distance most people Travel is the 18-inches between their head and their heart,” a photo shows.
They let out at 4 p.m. to rest up for the next day, the schedule shows.
“The Mindfuless & Resiliency Summit will gather 450 federal employees from various departments (Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Energy, Department of Homeland Security, Border Patrol, IRS, Department of Justice, and more) to engage, learn, and practice mindfulness and wellness tools,” the summit’s website states.
“The USDA Forest Service is cohosting with Wisdom 2.0 the 2-day summit, held in the Jefferson Auditorium on August 6-7, 2019,” it continues. Jefferson Auditorium is in the Department of Agriculture’s headquarters, and the Forest Service is part of the USDA.
The two-day summit took up a combined 7,200 hours of federal employees’ time.
The session also included ABC News correspondent Dan Harris hawking advice from his self-help book “10% Happier: How I Tamed the Voice in My Head,” according to a conference booklet, which is called an “Inspirational Journal” and encouraged attendees to “doodle.”
On-site massages were also offered, according to pictures of the venue, presentations, and materials obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation.
The second day was dominated by presentations from Michelle Reugebrink, who works full-time as the Forest Service’s “Mindfulness & Resiliency Program Manager with the Work Environment & Performance Office,” at a $102,000 salary, pay records show.
“Our mind is an instrument do not let it play you,” Reugebrink taught in one PowerPoint presentation. “Our minds can give us fake News … recognize how easy it is to take personally so many things.”
“They are narratives ………. Like why I am not good enough? Who would I be without that thought? If they had what we had or we had what they had,” it continued.
In a profile on the Forest Service’s website, Reugebrink said: 
I teach mindfulness and compassion practices that enable all of us to not just survive but also grow from exposure to stress. Mindfulness and compassion practices are core skills that foster high performance and promote diversity and inclusion. I do a lot of coaching and I am also passionate about bringing restorative justice practices to our work environment.
Forest Service employees include firefighters who can experience life-threatening situations, but it is unclear why employees of the IRS and others would need to learn about meditation, “trauma,” and “restorative justice.”
At another conference appearance, Reugebrink also revealed the government held a meditation conference at a luxury retreat in California where the “whole government” was planning on coming, and that it occurred during the longest government shutdown in history—a stalemate over federal funding in early 2019.
“We started the Mindfulness Compassion Inclusivity Summit, and 1440 Multiversity helped host us,” Reugebrink said. “It was beautiful … we held it in January, and we had big plans for the whole government, like, to come and then we got furloughed. So I did it on my own.”
1440 Multiversity, which bills itself as a “luxury retreat in the redwoods of Scotts Valley,” California, uploaded video of a “USFS Summit” that took place Jan. 15 to 17, 2019. A room with a queen bed at 1440 Multiversity costs $645 a night.
She made those remarks at a Wisdom 2.0 Conference in March, which Reugebrink said she’d attended for the past seven years. She spoke about “Mindfulness in the Federal Government” in an interview with host Soren Gordhamer, who also presented with her at the August government conference.
“How do you actually have a job teaching mindfulness as a firefighter?” Gordhamer asked with a laugh.
“It’s been a journey,” she said. “I started seeing a lot of change in me. And I had a conversation with leadership: What would it look like if we got out of our own way? What if we taught mindfulness-based stress reduction in the government and see what happened? And I can tell you I have 2,000 people in my class right now for the winter MBSR [mindfulness-based stress reduction] class.”
“This is to government employees? Because I have this notion that government employees … ” Gordhamer asked.
Reugebrink said she had employees from FEMA, the Office of Personnel Management, and the IRS, and that it was also open to nongovernment employees.
“Who OK’d this, by the way?” Gordhamer asked, with the audience bursting into laughter.
“Civil rights … that’s where the most movement happened,” she replied. “The civil rights director and deputy, the chief of the forest service, I went and talked with Congressman Tim Ryan.”
She said she offers “monthly guided meditations and mindfulness webinars on a different theme. Last month is happiness, this month is self-compassion.”
On her YouTube channel, she teaches about “20 minute sitting,” in which she invites federal workers and others to simply sit and stare blankly ahead for 20 minutes. They should not become “attached” to any thoughts, and concentrate on their breathing instead, she said.
Reugebrink is a regular presenter at events like the Forest Bathing International Conference, which is held by a for-profit organization. The 2019 conference was sponsored by the Forest Service.
The U.S. Forest Service is another proud sponsor of our upcoming Forest Bathing International Conference.  We’re honored to be working an organization whose mission so closely aligns with our own. Become a sponsor today! ? https://t.co/TSlL0NiC2a pic.twitter.com/zqDAGOrDfL
In forest bathing or forest therapy, people participate in “healing activities that can be incorporated into a walk in a forest or any other natural area.” At the association affiliated with Forest Bathing International, trainers who specialize in social justice and social change charge $3,170 to teach people how to teach others about forest bathing.
Meghan Rodgers, a political appointee who serves as press secretary for Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue, did not respond to repeated questions about the mindfulness conferences, including what meditation had to do with diversity or civil rights.

School systems across the country are seeking to abolish honors classes, teach how math has been used to oppress people, and let truant students into gifted schools. Advocates say the moves are aimed at diminishing an achievement gap between demographic groups.
In one county, a busing initiative led to a populist uprising and rare bipartisan unity. Parents spanning races and parties say they did not ask for the changes, but politicians are pushing them through anyway.
Washington State
In October, Seattle Public Schools unveiled a “framework” to inject “math ethnic studies” into all K-12 math classes, teaching “how math has been and continues to be used to oppress and marginalize people and communities of color.”
Students will be asked to “identify the inherent inequities of the standardized testing system used to oppress and marginalize people and communities of color” and “explain how math dictates economic oppression.”
“Why/how does data-driven processes prevent liberation?” it asks. “How important is it to be Right? What is Right? Says Who?”
The curriculum was pushed by the school district’s ethnic studies program manager, Tracy Castro-Gill, who on Oct. 19 tweeted a picture with her “Marxist ringleader” and said the “next step is matching ‘INDOCTRINATED’ t-shirts!”
“I am an educator of color in Seattle whose job is anti-racist work within the school district. Seattle is very white—nearly 70%. It’s also one of the most liberal cities in the US, and these liberal, white Seattleites hate being called racist, but the thing is—a lot of them are,” she wrote.
Though she was hired by the superintendent and the school board, Castro-Gill said criticisms of the math proposal from one board member’s Asian wife were racist. She also asked people to “help me push” the board and superintendent to oppose “rewhiting.”
Castro-Gill wrote on her blog that her mother is white and her father is Hispanic, but that she has a strained relationship.
“I’m fairly radical atheist and consider myself a far left anarchist who fights for racial justice,” she wrote. “My parents are both Trump supporting Republicans.”
She is also at odds with her child’s father after their child declared herself “nonbinary” after reading literature about transgenderism.
A spokesman for Seattle’s superintendent, Denise Juneau, did not return a request for comment.
Maryland
In Howard County, Maryland, the school board appears poised to proceed with a plan, drafted by an out-of-state consultant, to bus 7,300 students out of their neighborhood schools to adjust the distribution of impoverished students in each school—despite that no discernible constituency is asking for it.
The county council said its goal is to “address the achievement gaps by racial and socioeconomic factors.” The plan would move students based on how many receive free and reduced meals in those neighborhoods.
Additionally, Howard is the most-integrated school system in the state, the Baltimore Sun reported. But the county council’s resolution says any school with less than 40% white students is defined as segregated.
In Howard County, 39% of students are white, meaning that by its logic, if every school exactly reflected the racial makeup of the county as a whole, every school in Howard County would be segregated.
Resident Carl Manganillo testified Oct. 10 that the board had heard 2,500 comments with opponents outnumbering supporters of the plan 100-to-1.
“As far as I can tell, the only proponents of this plan are the politicians,” he said.
Asian, white, black, and Hispanic parents marched in the streets in massive protests. “I want to stay with my friends,” a fourth-grader pleaded. “Keep the ‘unity’ in community,” a black mother urged.
More than 80 people spoke at a hearing Oct. 7, and not one of them wanted the plan to proceed, CBS’ Baltimore affiliate reported.
Lori Grant, who is an assistant director at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission—the federal government’s anti-discrimination arm—and the mother of a black student in a Howard school, testified in her personal capacity that the school board should not proceed with the plan and that it is likely illegal.
“Basically, they could care less what the parents think,” resident George Henry said in a letter to the Baltimore Sun.
With parents overwhelmingly opposed, state politicians got in the mix—one cutting the line of people testifying—to attempt to push the county policy across the finish line.
In a Facebook group that quickly attracted 4,000 members, a near populist revolt fomented, with members pledging to vote every Howard politician out of office.
Larry Walker, a member of the Attendance Area Committee that helped form the plan, is also a pastor at Celebration Church, and said at a Sept. 8 service: 
We have a partnership with the school system and the superintendent is looking for brown people to show up and put our voices behind this plan that he came out with—it’s a bold plan and the community is hatin’ on it right now—they’re hatin’ on it—so he needs … he needs some allies, folks.
School spokesman Brian Bassett did not respond to questions from The Daily Caller News Foundation about what kind of partnership the government has with a church, and why the superintendent was “looking” for people to support a plan rather than drafting one with organic public support.
New York City
In the nation’s largest school system, a panel appointed by the mayor proposed in August to eliminate the city’s gifted and talented schools and programs in the service of racial integration garnered front-page New York Times coverage.
The proposal would end the practice of gifted and talented schools screening students by exams and grades—and even block considering students’ attendance records at their previous schools.
It also said it was unfair that students who were not fluent in English were “underrepresented” in the most rigorous academic programs.
“If you get rid of testing, you’re open to subjective decision-making … you’ll see a lot of parents send their children to private schools, and you’re just furthering the income gap,” David Lee of the Chinese American Citizens Alliance told New York’s CBS affiliate.
Robert Cornegy, a black Democratic city councilman from Brooklyn, told the Times the proposal seemed to come from “uber liberals” and said minorities are not served well by taking the rigor out of education.
“If you eliminate the gifted and talented program it eliminates the chances of getting into specialized programs and institutions of higher learning,” he said. “Just like there’s a pipeline to prison, there is a pipeline to higher academic success and college.”
Jonathan Plucker, a professor at Johns Hopkins University and a member of the National Association for Gifted Children’s board, told the Times, “You can say everyone is being treated the same, but if they are being treated poorly, that’s a horrible form of equity.”
Still, New York schools chancellor Richard Carrenza said “this is not about lowering the bar.”
In May, three white school administrators sued Carrenza’s Department of Education for $90 million, saying, “DOE has swiftly and irrevocably silenced, sidelined and punished plaintiffs and other Caucasian female DOE employees on the basis of their race, gender and unwillingness to accept their other colleagues’ hateful stereotypes about them,” the New York Post reported.
LaShawn Robinson, then the executive director of the DOE’s Office of Equity and Access, said, “Values of white culture are supremacist,” according to the lawsuit. Robinson replaced Lois Herrera, a Harvard graduate who had worked for the schools since 1986, with a black man, stashed her belongings under a stairwell, demoted her three levels, and transferred her to the Bronx, it stated.
Another plaintiff, Jaye Murray, was forced to report her activities to the new boss every 30 minutes, it said. The third plaintiff, Laura Feijoo, was replaced by a black woman who did not have the necessary license to do the job, it stated.
Separately, a fourth white female former employee, Leslie Chislett, sued New York’s DOE for $20 million. Chislett had spearheaded a campaign to promote Advanced Placement classes for more students, but, “unfortunately, under Chancellor Carranza’s leadership, something has gone very wrong with the Equity and Excellence agenda,” she told the Post.
All DOE employees were forced to undergo “training” sessions that told them a desire for “excellence” was part of “white supremacy,” Chislett’s lawsuit stated.
“There is white toxicity in the air,” DOE senior executive Ruby Ababio-Fernandez said in a school presentation, according to the suit.
A spokeswoman did not return a request for comment.
Virginia
In Fairfax County, Virginia, the school board eliminated the position of chief academic officer and replaced it with chief equity officer. It also proposed revising the boundary-drawing process to remove “instructional effectiveness” and “the impact on neighborhoods” as factors, in favor of “the socioeconomic and/or racial composition of students.”
For 18 months, the board repeatedly discussed an imperative to gain “equity” in school demographics, but with an election Nov. 5, it suddenly sought to distance itself from the rhetoric.
The board is “not considering boundary adjustments at this time,” spokeswoman Kathleen Thomas told The Daily Caller News Foundation.
The school system hired a consultant to study boundary changes in the context of its “equity” policy. Parent Laura Timmins told The Daily Caller News Foundation she suspects the board is looking to offload it onto a third party to shield politicians from blowback for moves that are unpopular with residents.
Prior to community uproar, the board seemed to recognize that residents would not be in favor of the plan, and that subtlety would be imperative. 
Board member Karen Keys-Gamarra said in a school board meeting, “I have no problem with certainly alerting the community as gently as we can, because, like you, I’m not sure I want to hear about this for the next 10 years.”
When constituents from an area with a high-performing school told their school board member, Janie Strauss, that such changes could plummet their home values, Strauss flatly denied any changes were afoot. But she also told colleagues at a board meeting she had “warned” the school’s community that a “big chunk is going to be reboundaried.”
Board member Pat Hynes appeared to acknowledge that removing children from their schools in the name of racial integration would be for naught if the existence of rigorous honors classes still separated children based on test scores.
“Changing school boundaries must be primary tool of integrating schools for diversity. But equally important is ending counter-productive sorting-and-separating that creates segregated schools-within-schools. Goal = integrated classrooms,” she tweeted from a presentation at the National School Board Association’s 2019 conference.
In one school in Fairfax, 78% of students failed “plain English Algebra” and 30% failed a basic competency test in English, leading Timmins and other parents in the second-richest county in the U.S. to wonder how their children could apply to competitive colleges if they were required to take the same classes.
The racial focus of the 12-person school board—fueled by its eight white Democrats—led liberal residents to turn against the party, with one saying she’s cast ballots for Democrats in every election since 1971, but “when it comes to this year’s County level races, that will not happen.”
Minnesota
In July, Eastern Carver County, Minnesota—which is 87% white—revealed it had hired Muhammad Khalifa to do an “equity audit.”
It also hired Keith Brooks as director of equity, who compared himself to Trayvon Martin and said, “My questioning, or asking questions, or looking at things through an equity lens comes off as belligerent or angry.”
In protest against a board they perceived as being unresponsive to their constituency, some residents pledged to vote in November to deny a funding request the school system says is needed for a new school.
“Khalifa was paid $90,000, Dr. Brooks got $138,000, and you’re saying you don’t have enough money for education, then what are you spending it on this stuff for?” Lynn McHale, a member of Parents for D112 schools, told The Daily Caller News Foundation.
“There’s a girl who came home from school and cried and said, ‘I wish I wasn’t white,’ after she was exposed to this ‘equity’ stuff,” she said.
“The superintendents of the nearby jurisdictions have joined into a group called Reimagine Minnesota, and it’s pushing race,” she continued. She suspects it wants to “consolidate into one metropolitan school district, where they would bus inner-city kids from Minneapolis to the suburbs,” relating to a lawsuit called Cruz-Guzman. Reimagine Minnestoa says its purpose is a “collective action plan to address integration.”
Celi Haga, a school spokeswoman, told The Daily Caller News Foundation the school’s system was not fulfilling its mission “as long as the outcomes for groups of students are meaningfully different.”
At a contentious, standing room-only school board meeting, when residents voiced opposition to the increasing role of race in education, “they told us not to clap, that they would shut down the meeting.”
Some people who spoke in favor of the initiatives were teachers in the school system, taking up limited time from parents. McHale said teachers have been told not to voice criticism of the initiative.
“The way I view it is a coach should try to make everyone a better player, but you never hold someone back,” she said.

"“Democrat lawyers are descending on Florida,” Sen. Marco Rubio tweeted Thursday. “They have been very clear they aren’t here to make sure every vote is counted. They are here to change the results of election; & Broward is where they plan to do it.” (Photo: Joshua Roberts/Reuters/Newscom)
Republican Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is warning that the fate of his state’s governorship could hang in the hands of Florida’s Broward County Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes, whom he’s called incompetent for violating state and federal laws. A liberal candidate similarly painted her as incompetent and corrupt.
Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum initially conceded the Florida race to Republican Ron DeSantis, but backtracked after vote totals changed Thursday, narrowing the gap to less than half a percent in both the gubernatorial and senatorial races. Broward County is often the slowest of the state’s 67 counties to count votes, and its election department has repeatedly been faulted for wrongdoing.

Now, Perkins Coie lawyer Marc Elias has been enlisted in a recount effort. Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson is retaining Elias, who said it’s “not plausible” that, as Broward statistics suggest, 14,000 people voted in sometimes-obscure state-level races but left the Senate one blank.
Republican Gov. Rick Scott, who, by initial appearances, beat Nelson in a race for Senate, said Elias will use aggressive techniques to “steal” the election.
Elias worked for both the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 election, even before the 2016 presidential candidate became the Democratic nominee, when the two were supposed to be independent. Coie also hired Fusion GPS during that election to investigate then-candidate Donald Trump, which ultimately resulted in an unverified dossier being sent to the FBI.
“Democrat lawyers are descending on Florida,” Rubio tweeted Thursday. “They have been very clear they aren’t here to make sure every vote is counted. They are here to change the results of election; & Broward is where they plan to do it.”
Now democrat lawyers are descending on #Florida. They have been very clear they aren’t here to make sure every vote is counted. 
– They are here to change the results of election; & – #Broward is where they plan to do it.#Sayfie

“Bay County was hit by a Cat 4 Hurricane just 4 weeks ago, yet managed to count votes & submit timely results,” the Florida Republican continued. “Yet over 41 hours after polls closed Broward elections office is still counting votes?”
Rubio also pointed out that Snipes “doesn’t know how many ballots are left to be counted” and that she isn’t regularly reporting results, which are “chipping away at GOP leads.”
#Broward supervisor:– says she doesn’t know how many ballots are left to be counted; &– Isn’t reporting hourly or regularly,but rather releasing thousands of additional votes,often in the overnight hours,that are chipping away at GOP leads

A liberal college professor who ran for Congress challenging Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz from the left, Tim Canova, made similar statements. Wasserman Schultz resigned as head of the Democratic National Committee after leaked emails showed party officials seeking to rig the 2016 presidential primary against independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, but she continues to represent the Broward area in the House.
It’s now close to 43 hours since the polls closed and Brenda Snipes STILL doesn’t know how many votes are left to count! The results in my race are IMPOSSIBLE to believe. WATCH her explain in video below! https://t.co/1RyQ5cLsN4
— Tim Canova (@Tim_Canova) November 8, 2018

A judge found in August that Snipes improperly handled mail-in ballots, and ordered her not to open mail-in ballots in secret after the Republican Party complained. Snipes’ defense rested on a claim that she didn’t know what the word “canvassing” meant, even though she is on the county’s canvassing board.
In May, a judge found that Snipes’ office broke the law by destroying ballots in the 2016 race between Wasserman Schultz and Canova.
Canova told The Daily Caller News Foundation that in that case, “they claimed to not know the difference between a federal and state investigation. They claim to be incompetent, but my impression is it’s partly a ruse.”
Polling and early voting results showed him performing well in 2016, then the reported results rapidly shifted to favor Wasserman Schultz, leading him to suspect manipulation.
“So we put in a public records request to inspect some of the ballots, and if inspecting the paper ballot matched up, then it’s done, it will satisfy everyone,” Canova told The Daily Caller News Foundation. “But the supervisor of elections stonewalled me for months.”
“I was told they didn’t have scanned images, even though on election night they put the ballots through a scanner. So we filed a discovery request to see the paper ballots,” he continued. “Three days later [Snipes] signed an order to destroy the ballots and certified that they were not the subject to ongoing litigation.”
“Her excuse was she just signed anything put in front of her and didn’t read it,” Canova said. “Then she said the ballots were put in the wrong place and that’s why they were destroyed. She concealed the destruction for two weeks.”
Snipes’ position is an elected one, and she is a Democrat.
Canova said even though Snipes admitted to destroying the ballots in a videotaped deposition, the government continued to fight the case.
“They’re using taxpayer money while bleeding us dry.”
Canova questioned why Scott and state Attorney General Pam Bondi, who’s also a Republican, didn’t pursue Snipes for criminal prosecution. He said she could face felony charges that carry five years in prison.
“We’re dealing with organized crime. I just don’t trust anything that comes out of this office,” he said. He said Republicans had joined with him to try to defeat Wasserman Schultz, saying, “I might not agree with Tim about ‘Medicare for All,’ but this about integrity, this is about getting out corruption.”
She sure wasn't happy in her sworn deposition where she ADMITS to illegally destroying all YOUR paper ballots in my 2016 race against Wasserman Schultz. Watch/Listen to Snipes' LAME EXCUSE for committing felonies yet to be investigated by law enforcement. https://t.co/6LOct7zVG6 pic.twitter.com/MNA6SwrnCA

Rubio also retweeted that a teacher said she found a box of provisional ballots left behind at a school after Election Day.

I’m looking forward to the day when Brenda Snipes, Broward Elections Supervisor, goes to prison for destroying every ballot cast in 2016 primary.

"Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., speaks at a America Welcomes event at Union Station on May 16, 2019, in Washington, D.C. (Photo: 
Tasos Katopodis/ Stringer/Getty Images)
Rep. Ilhan Omar swore under oath in a 2017 divorce filing that she hadn’t seen her husband Ahmed N. Elmi in six years and didn’t know anyone who might be able to locate him—yet he appears to have designed a website for Omar’s sister this year, according to data hidden in the source code of that website.
The Democratic Minnesota congresswoman swore that she had not been able to locate the man she married—who the Minneapolis Star Tribune says may or may not be her brother—since 2011. 
She swore she didn’t know the names of anyone in her husband’s family and that the two had no mutual acquaintances who might know how to contact him.
According to Elmi’s Facebook profile, after attending college in North Dakota, he moved to England and then to Nairobi, Kenya—the same city where Omar’s sister, Sahra Noor, lives and works as CEO of Grit Partners. 
Grit Partners’ website code contains data that indicates Elmi was involved in the creation of either the company’s website or its Instagram account.
The ties between Omar’s supposedly long-lost ex-husband and Omar’s sister appear to contradict Omar’s sworn testimony and add to the body of evidence that the ex-husband may be her brother, making all three siblings.
Other elements of her sworn filing also contain discrepancies. 
In arguing that she should be granted a divorce without her husband’s consent because he could not be located, she claimed that she did not know the name of a single member of her husband’s immediate family. 
She also claimed that her attempts to find him included unsuccessfully searching on social media—but he has been on Twitter since 2012 and Facebook since 2007 and is also on LinkedIn and other platforms.
Lying on a sworn form is perjury and each charge carries five years in prison, according to Minnesota law. Questions have been raised about the accuracy of approximately six statements on the sworn form.
Hidden Code
Grit Partners’ website contains code generated by its web design software Squarespace that includes certain data that is not visible on the page itself. 
In a section of code powering the site’s links to its Twitter and Instagram pages, Elmi’s name is included, tying him to the Instagram account. It says “screenname: Ahmed Elmi” and “UserName: ahmednelmi.”
Elmi’s LinkedIn says he works as a freelance creator of “content, communications strategies and editorial for nonprofits, start-ups and global brands.”
The hidden code was discovered by David Steinberg, a veteran journalist most recently with PJ Media, who has published significant information about Elmi over the last years. 
He has previously published screenshots that appear to show the person with the “ahmednelmi” Instagram was photographed with Omar during the period that Omar swore she had no contact with him, had the same birthdate as Omar’s husband, and held Omar’s baby soon after it was born, calling her his “niece.”
Democratic activist Barb Lickness confirmed to the Star Tribune that the man in one of those screenshots—billed as being from Omar’s Instagram and depicting the now-congresswoman with Elmi in London in 2015—was the same Ahmed Elmi who was a neighbor of hers in Minneapolis but who never mentioned being married.
The media has been hesitant to accept the screenshots as proof that Elmi is Omar’s brother because the Instagram accounts were deleted, so the papers could not independently corroborate the screenshots’ authenticity.
However, the Grit Partners code is still online and has been corroborated by The Daily Caller News Foundation. 
The Daily Caller News Foundation also archived it on the Internet Archive and another archiving service so that date-stamped copies are preserved even if the website is changed. It can be verified by right-clicking, selecting “view source” and searching for Elmi’s name.
Domain registration records show the Grit Partners website was registered on Jan. 10, 2019, and the code that mentions Elmi’s name says the Instagram account was linked to the site on Jan. 17.
A Missing Husband
Omar requested a “default” divorce from Elmi in 2017, an unusual proceeding used where one spouse has disappeared and cannot be located. 
Since the process deprives one party of contesting the divorce, it required Omar to swear under oath that she had no clues whatsoever about how to contact him through other people.
On the form above, she swears her “most recent contact” with Elmi was in June 2011 in London and the “last known location of respondent’s employment” was unknown.
She swears the “names and locations of respondent’s parents, siblings, children and other close relatives are as follows: Unknown.”
She swears the “names and locations of other persons who are likely to know the respondent’s whereabouts are: Unknown to me.”
It continues: “I believe that it is not likely that respondent’s location will become known to me, but there is a reasonable possibility that mail will be forwarded or otherwise reach respondent if addressed as follows: No known address.”
The document says, “I have made the following efforts to locate the respondent: Looked for on Social media.” It concludes: “I declare under penalty of perjury that everything I have stated in this document is true and correct.” It is signed and dated Aug. 2, 2017.
The Most Recent in a Line of Unanswered Questions About Her Marriage
Omar visited Nairobi in December 2016, days after winning election to the Minnesota state Legislature and not long before the divorce papers were sworn, PJ Media reported. 
From Nairobi, she flew to Somalia. Omar praised the newly formed Somalian government in a speech in March 2017. Two days later, Noor’s husband, Mohamed Keynan, got a top political job working for Somalia’s prime minister, PJ Media reported.
This month, the Minnesota Campaign Finance and Public Disclosure Board fined Omar in an investigation that revealed she filed joint tax returns with another man during her marriage to Elmi. That man also fathered children with Omar both before and after the marriage to Elmi.
Omar “was living with her current husband, Ahmed Abdisalan Hirsi, throughout her entire legal marriage to Ahmed Nur Said Elmi, contradicting the story she tells to explain her multiple marriages,” the Washington Examiner reported Sunday based on an extensive review of local records such as speeding tickets that display addresses.
The Star Tribune wrote Saturday that “New investigative documents released by a state agency”—detailing Omar’s frantic formation of a “crisis committee” to try to keep the press from examining the nature of her relationship to Elmi—“have given fresh life to lingering questions about the marital history of Rep. Ilhan Omar and whether she once married a man—possibly her own brother—to skirt immigration laws.”
“Omar’s sister Sahra Noor was a high-profile executive of the Twin Cities health care nonprofit People’s Center Clinics & Services until 2018. She declined interview requests in 2016. She currently runs her own health care consultancy in Kenya. An e-mail to her was not returned and efforts to call her there were unsuccessful,” the Star Tribune reported.
Noor did not return a request for comment from The Daily Caller News Foundation.
Omar’s spokesman, Jeremy Slevin, also did not respond to a request for comment from The Daily Caller News Foundation. 
To the Star Tribune, he responded with an ad hominem saying the questions from the district’s largest media outlet were illegitimate because conservative-leaning media had also asked them and that attempts to get to the bottom of the story by asking members of Omar’s family amounted to harassment.
“Whether by colluding with right-wing outlets to go after Muslim elected officials or hounding family members, legitimate media outlets have a responsibility not to fan the flames of hate,” he said.

"Secretary of Veterans Affairs David Shulkin, who says someone impersonated his chief of staff in one or more emails, testifies Feb. 15 to a House committee on the agency's budget.      (Photo: Joshua Roberts/Reuters/ Newscom) 
In an interview, Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin detailed new claims that his agency was hacked or spoofed, but the VA released a statement within the hour saying it could find no evidence of compromised emails.
“It was a request to wire money out of the VA to somewhere else,” Shulkin said of one email in the interview Friday with The Daily Caller News Foundation.
Rep. Mike Coffman, R-Colo., said the discrepancy between Shulkin and his own agency appeared to be evidence of an attempt to “muddy the waters” around an investigation that led to the resignation of Shulkin’s chief of staff.

An inspector general’s report released Wednesday said taxpayers were billed wrongfully for Shulkin’s wife’s travel to Europe.
That report hinged upon findings that the VA secretary’s longtime chief of staff, Vivieca Wright Simpson, changed a June 2017 email to facilitate the payments for the trip.
On Thursday, Shulkin implied to a House committee that Simpson might not have been responsible for that email, and rather, it might have been a hacker impersonating her. He insisted that his department has “found there are people sending emails from her account that aren’t her.”
In a videotaped interview Friday at the offices of The Daily Caller News Foundation, Shulkin said his assertions of hacking rested upon an impersonation attempt that occurred hours before he told the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee about a history of such activity.
On the day the inspector general’s report came out, an email sent from his chief of staff’s account requested a suspicious wire transfer of funds from the VA, he said.
“It was a request to wire money out of the VA to somewhere else,” Shulkin said. “Fortunately our finance department thought that was an unusual request and brought it to our attention, so there was no money sent out.”
He added:
The finance department came to Mrs. Wright Simpson on Wednesday morning and said, ‘Why are you requesting a wire transfer outside the VA?’ and they brought her the email, and she said, ‘I never wrote that email.’ Mrs. Simpson’s email was being impersonated by someone else.

Shulkin said the financial request was “hacking” or “spoofing,” and did not actually come from Simpson.
“Wednesday was the first time that I was aware of that single situation, and certainly want to make sure that we understand whether it was an isolated situation or something more extensive. … I don’t know whether this is related to the approval of the travel, that’s something we want to understand, but we don’t have any evidence of that right now.”
“The motivation was a financial crime,” Shulkin said.
‘No Evidence’
It was not clear what motive an impersonator would have for altering an email to help Shulkin’s wife, Merle Bari, book a trip, and the VA secretary acknowledged that “we have no evidence that that’s related to the IG report, none at all.”
An hour after he left The Daily Caller News Foundation’s newsroom Friday afternoon, the VA’s website posted a statement saying it had found no evidence of any hack, either in June or Wednesday.
“We have thus far found no credible or conclusive evidence of a compromise to our email system or a user’s account,” it said.
Some observers questioned Shulkin’s claims that someone was impersonating his chief of staff and said they were suspicious that his allegations coincided with the release of the inspector general’s report.
“Based on the timing and the VA’s own press release, which found no evidence of an outside intrusion, this appears like it could be a setup, a faked hack,” said Coffman, a member of the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee. “I think that’s very suspicious. This is kind of ‘My dog ate my homework.'”
Congress should call for Shulkin’s resignation, Coffman said, because of what he calls earlier manipulation of evidence and now the implication to lawmakers that there was credible reason to think the email might not be real.
“What we know now is there’s no evidence of a hack,” Coffman said. “I think he’s trying to muddy the waters on this. It’s not the issue itself, it’s the cover-up; it speaks to his lack of integrity.”
An early indication that the “hack” wasn’t what it seemed came at the hearing Thursday, when a committee member said the Justice Department  should be brought in to prosecute the hacker, Coffman said.
“I looked at the secretary’s face, and he seemed surprised, like ‘Uh-oh.’ But what else would you do?”
‘A Serious Crime’
Pete Hegseth, a former head of Concerned Veterans for America who has studied the Department of Veterans Affairs, said that “to any level-headed person, this appears to be manufactured.”
“The IG needs to look into whether he made this up,” Hegseth said.
Shulkin has gone to significant lengths to try to control the fallout of the inspector general’s report. Before the purported impersonation attempt, the VA secretary hired an outside company specializing in public relations crisis management to come up with strategies to rebut the findings.
Shulkin found himself on thin ice with the White House after warning officials there that a report was coming, but downplaying its severity. The action caused some Trump administration officials to feel misled, The Washington Post reported. The White House forced Shulkin to delete a statement that said, “I have done nothing wrong.”
But on Friday, he declined to provide examples when asked if he’d done anything wrong.
In initial comments Thursday to Congress and to reporters, Shulkin implied that an impersonator may have written the email on travel to Europe.
However, the questioned email came following a verbal conversation, in the middle of a rapid-fire, back-and-forth email thread, and included a request by Simpson to move the conversation over to phone by calling her at her office.
Simpson herself would not deny having altered the email, but instead played coy, the inspector general’s report said.
Shulkin didn’t explain how someone could have sent out emails in Simpson’s name without his chief of staff’s knowledge given that recipients replied to those emails.
Shulkin said he did recognize that someone sending an email using his chief of staff’s name would be a serious offense.
“Impersonating a government official’s email is a serious crime,” he said.
New Trip ‘Not Happening’
Simpson stepped down from her post hours before Shulkin’s interview.
“Simpson has elected to retire following the release of a VA Inspector General investigation,” the agency said in a press release. “VA also announced that it has opened a formal investigation into her actions.”
Shulkin acknowledged that the scandal has become not about the European junket, but about his trustworthiness and integrity.
The inspector general’s report determined that Shulkin personally said he could accept free tickets to Wimbledon on the trip because they were given by a friend of his wife’s, but that person could not recall his wife’s name.
Investigators also found that the VA “issued a misleading statement to The Washington Post about the trip and did not correct the statement.”
John Ullyot, assistant secretary for public and intergovernmental affairs, said Shulkin personally drafted the offending passage, but the VA secretary said he had no involvement.
Before the Friday interview, The Daily Caller News Foundation learned from a senior department official that Shulkin has an upcoming official trip to the Vatican with his wife.
In the interview, Shulkin was asked what benefit the trip would provide to taxpayers or veterans.
“I am not going on any trip to the Vatican or any trip abroad. That is not happening,” Shulkin responded.
The source reiterated that the trip is currently on the books, saying Shulkin and his wife are scheduled to travel to Vatican City from April 20 to 29 to attend the Pontifical Council for Culture.
The Vatican is the one of few countries that do not have a military. The Council for Culture includes a show of European art and religious history.

"The San Francisco Board of Education unanimously voted last month in favor of painting over a George Washington mural series on a school wall depicting Washington standing over a Native American’s corpse and another in the company of slaves on his Mount Vernon estate.

The San Francisco Board of Education unanimously voted last month in favor of painting over a George Washington mural series on a school wall depicting Washington standing over a Native American’s corpse and another in the company of slaves on his Mount Vernon estate.
“This is reparations,” Education Board Commissioner Mark Sanchez said in a KQED report when asked about the estimated $600,000 price tag for its removal. It could reportedly take a year to complete.  
The 1,600-square-foot mural series titled “Life of Washington” was painted on San Francisco’s George Washington High School in 1936 by a Russian-American artist and Stanford University art professor Victor Arnautoff. 
It was funded by the New Deal’s Works Progress Administration and shows a variety of scenes from Washington’s life. 
School district spokeswoman Laura Dudnick confirmed that although only two mural pieces stand out as offensive to members of the community, the board’s decision would apply to all 13 panels of the mural. 
School board members had to decide whether to cover and preserve the painting using panels or textile, or completely erase it by painting over it. Buckling under pressure from those who find the images offensive to certain members of the school community, the board decided to paint over it. 
Advocates for removing the mural included local high school students, George Washington High School graduates, and Native Americans. 
During a public comment portion of the June 25 meeting, Paloma Flores, program coordinator for the district’s Indian Education Program, said, per KQED, “It’s not a matter of offense, it’s a matter of the right to learn without a hostile environment.”
“Intent does not negate lived experience,” she added. 
According to KQED, mural critics in the community “believe the artist’s intentions are irrelevant in light of the harm to young people of color daily confronted by images of their ancestors debased.”
Native American Barbara Mumby-Huerta, who staffs the San Francisco Art Commission, challenged statements on historical accuracy, saying that the mural is ignorant of indigenous people. 
“To portray a Native person face down, dead, you are trapping their soul so that they can not move on,” she said, per KQED.
One mural supporter says he plans to legally challenge the move to paint over the mural. Lope Yap Jr., vice president of the school’s alumni group, vowed to “use every tactic available” for litigation, according to KQED. 
Before the school board meeting, the San Francisco Chronicle polled art leaders in the Bay Area about the controversy. 
“I am deeply sensitive to the pain that this situation is causing the student body and Washington High School community,” said Neal Benezra, director of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.
“A decision to paint over the mural is irreversible,” he added. “The option to cover the artwork with panels to allow future educational research keeps open that opportunity.”
Jarrett Stepman of The Daily Signal wrote about the removal of the mural, citing a historian’s account of Arnautoff, “a man of the left in his own time,” and his intention of making Washington “less glamorized” by painting images of the slaves he owned or the price paid with Native Americans’ blood during westward expansion.
In his interview with historian Fergus M. Bordewich, Bordewich explains: 
[Arnautoff] included those images not to glorify Washington, but rather to provoke a nuanced evaluation of his legacy. The scene with the dead Native American, for instance, calls attention to the price of ‘manifest destiny.’ Arnautoff’s murals also portray the slaves with humanity and the several live Indians as vigorous and manly.
Those who condemn the murals have misunderstood it, seeing only what they sought to find. They’ve also got their history seriously wrong. Washington did own slaves—124 men, women, and children—and oversaw many more who belonged to his wife’s family. But by his later years he had evolved into a proto-abolitionist, a remarkable ethical journey for a man of his time, place, and class.
The removal of the mural is expected to take at least a year, according to district staff. Before proceeding with painting over the mural, its historical significance requires an environmental review. 
In the case that the painting takes more time than expected, the district could cover it with panels. Three years, Sanchez said, would be considered “undue delay.”

"California has become a one-party state in a short amount of time. Its example is a warning to America, not a guide. (Photo: Mike Blake/Reuters/Newscom)

Is America destined to become like California?
Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey created a stir recently when he tweeted out an article calling for an end to bipartisanship and the beginning of nationwide, one-party rule—similar to the Golden State. He called it a “great read.”
Great read https://t.co/O2djSQf8Qv
— jack (@jack) April 6, 2018

A Twitter spokesperson told The Daily Signal in an email, “Twitter’s tools are apolitical, and we enforce our rules without political bias.”
Nevertheless, the tweet certainly brings up concern over Twitter’s political bias.
The article, titled “The Great Lesson of California in America’s New Civil War,” argued that due to the intractable division of worldviews in America, bipartisanship is unworkable. It’s time to simply obliterate the other side.
The article was authored by Peter Leyden, the CEO of a media company called Reinvent, and Ruy Teixeira, a progressive political scientist. Teixeira argued after Barack Obama’s 2008 election victory that the GOP would go extinct for a generation because demographic trends would make Democrats unbeatable.
Needless to say, that didn’t come true.
But in a larger sense, it’s worth dissecting what a disaster the Californization of the whole country would be.
The authors point to California as a model for America’s political future. They explain how a once-bitterly divided state transformed into a state dominated by one party in a very short period of time—and they tout this as a good thing.
The problem in their analysis is that they essentially compare apples to oranges. The factors involved in California’s swing to one-party dominance were unique to California and can’t necessarily be applied to the country at large.
Moreover, Democratic Party dominance in California doesn’t necessarily mean Californians have become more progressive or that progressive policies have worked.
As a native Californian who has left the state, I witnessed California’s terrible turn firsthand.
Several factors went into this political sea change.
‘Jungle Primaries’ and Redistricting
California hasn’t always been a deep blue state. At one time it voted consistently for Republican presidential candidates, even up into the 1990s. But the state has gone leftward since that time, a situation fueled by both electoral and cultural changes.
In 2010, the state passed a new law requiring candidates to participate in a single consolidated open primary, often called the “jungle primary.” In these primaries, the top two vote-getters end up on the election ballot, where they square off against each other. This system has driven many Republicans off the election ballot, as the top two slots are often won by Democrats.
Some Republicans originally backed the jungle primary law, including then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. They hoped it would help moderate candidates in elections and thus make the state more bipartisan.
But what has happened is the exact opposite. This law made California ripe for one-party rule.
As The Daily Signal’s Fred Lucas wrote in The American Conservative, it led to bizarre absurdities, such as Democrat Sen. Dianne Feinstein being labeled the “Republican” option in a Senate race due to the fact that her only opponent was a more militant progressive than her.
Real political challengers are simply drowned out by the number of progressive voters in these primaries, and so a single ideology with only minor variance gets represented in the general election, as was the case in 2016 where Donald Trump was the only Republican on the ballot for a statewide election.
Larry N. Gerston, a professor emeritus of political science at San Jose State University, wrote for the Los Angeles Times that the jungle primary not only wiped out the Republican Party in California, it wiped out third parties that previously could challenge the status quo.
“California reformers argued that the major parties were dominated by extremes on the left and the right, and that a top-two system would attract centrist candidates, especially in districts where one party was dominant,” Gerston wrote. “They also contended that more competitive races would increase turnout. Early studies show that neither expectation has been met.”
In addition to the one-sided jungle primary system, a redistricting plan in 2010 tightened Democrats’ grip on the state. Initially billed as a nonpartisan effort to do away with gerrymandering, the plan was hijacked by state Democrats who stacked the commission with progressive activists posing as “Republicans.”
This further wiped out opposition to the Democratic Party in the state over the last decade.
>>> Eliminating Partisan Redistricting Will Make Politics Worse, Not Better
Middle-Class Californians Flee in Droves
Another major factor in California’s shift to the left is changing demographics. Many point to immigration as the primary reason for this shift, but flight has also played a significant role as people leave the state.
For a state that progressives tout as the ideal, there has been a remarkable amount of migration away from California in the last decade. Discontented Californians are voting with their feet, and those feet are moving with a quickening pace.
Though Leyden and Teixeira wrote that Republican policies have “engorged the rich while flatlining the incomes of the majority of Americans,” it’s actually been middle-income Californians who are fleeing the state while rich Americans from the Northeast trickle in.
“People making $55,000 or less a year were mostly moving out of California between 2007 and 2016 … while people making more than $200,000 a year moved in,” according to one report described in The San Diego Union-Tribune.
According to real estate website Curbed:
Due in large part to the state’s housing crisis, California is becoming wealthier and more economically stratified, as more of its citizens find it difficult to make ends meet. Every year, the state falls roughly 100,000 units short of what it needs to keep up with housing demand. That’s driving many middle-class residents out of the state, with little hope of returning.
With so many middle-income people leaving, what is left over in California is a two-tiered system of rich and poor in which the rich thrive and the poor muddle along.
Remarkably, this amazingly rich state now has the country’s highest poverty rates and lowest rating for “quality of life.”
How can this be?
A Basket Case
“California’s de facto status as a one-party state lies at the heart of its poverty problem,” wrote Kerry Jackson, the Pacific Research Institute’s fellow in California studies. “With a permanent majority in the state Senate and the Assembly, a prolonged dominance in the executive branch, and a weak opposition, California Democrats have long been free to indulge blue-state ideology while paying little or no political price. The state’s poverty problem is unlikely to improve while policymakers remain unwilling to unleash the engines of economic prosperity that drove California to its golden years.”
With their opposition made toothless, progressives have been free to conduct their policy experiments unopposed. The results leave much to be desired.
The irony is that California now veers closer to the repressive Republican caricature that Leyden and Teixeira described in their piece rather than the progressive utopia they say they want for the whole country.
The state increasingly stands out in the union as an extremist and increasingly dysfunctional basket case. Wealthy residents can withstand the state’s failures, but everyone else is paying the price of bad policy.
While the harmful effects of progressive policies are statewide, and often fall hardest on the redder communities within the state, no city better reflects the end result of California-style progressivism than San Francisco.
Though it is one of the wealthiest cities in the country, San Francisco is becoming known for its notorious homelessness problem, escalating crime rates, and various other pathologies.
One FBI report noted that while overall property crime rates were down around the country in 2017, San Francisco’s rates had jumped by 20 percent in just a year.
The Federalist’s John Davidson wrote in an expose on the disintegration of this marvelously wealthy, yet increasingly dystopian city.
Here was the perfect chance for progressives to create their ideal society. With no political opposition for a generation and fabulous wealth coming in through the tech boom, it should have been easy to transform this iconic and perfectly located city into exactly what they wanted.
But Davidson poignantly notes that San Francisco fails when judged by the standards of progressives themselves.
“The absence of any organized political opposition, combined with its vast wealth, makes San Francisco a kind of proof-of-concept for progressive governance,” Davidson wrote.
“ … That’s why the housing and homelessness problems besetting the city open it up to more than mere mockery from conservatives but substantive criticism of progressive governance writ large,” Davidson continued. “It’s not just homeless encampments that bedevil San Francisco, but also the flight of the middle class and the emergence of a kind of citywide caste system: the wealthy, the service class, and the destitute. In some ways, San Francisco is becoming something progressives are supposed to hate: a private club for the super-rich.”
San Francisco has managed to create an environment that progressives claim to abhor most. It is a tragic display of how bad ideas, regardless of intentions, lead to dysfunction.
And those very ideas that are eating away at San Francisco are increasingly the dominant ideology in the state capital.
It’s no wonder that so many middle-income Californians are fleeing to more hospitable states like Nevada and Texas.
Some of these states, like Texas, are now actively encouraging California citizens and businesses to leave California to escape high housing costs, overbearing regulations, and punitive taxes.
Not only that, but some conservative expatriates have actually created organizations to help conservative Californians settle into Texas communities that better reflect their values.
And it’s working.
The result is that the state’s blue politics is rapidly becoming bluer as conservative constituencies ditch the state for greener pastures.
Resisting the #Resistance
California may be losing residents, and it may have institutional barriers that make it unlikely to see a serious change in state policies.
However, this doesn’t mean that there isn’t still a significant portion of the population that resents and opposes the actions of the state government.
While the California government is resisting the federal government and the Trump administration, many Californians are themselves resisting “the resistance.”
As The New York Times reported of the mostly rural, northernmost parts of California:
Many liberals in California describe themselves as the resistance to Mr. Trump. Residents of the north say they are the resistance to the resistance, politically invisible to the Democratic governor and legislature. California’s strict regulations on the environment, gun control, and hunting impinge on a rural lifestyle, they say, that urban politicians do not understand.
It’s not just the rural north and central valley that oppose the state’s direction. Several counties have come out in opposition to the state’s sanctuary policies that have provoked a legal battle with the Trump administration’s agenda.
Orange County in Southern California recently passed measures aimed at aiding the federal government in immigration enforcement. More cities and localities have joined it and others are likely to follow suit.
There have even been a few proposals to break up the state into a few smaller states. One such plan has been proposed by tech billionaire Tim Draper, though this will likely have difficulty getting approved by Congress.
The fact is, California is not so monolithic as it often appears to outsiders, despite the one-sided vision coming from the state’s capital and from Hollywood.
California may have one-party rule, but there is a festering opposition among the governed, many of whom are resentful that their voices are ignored in the halls of power.
This cauldron is a far cry from the blissful one-party rule that Leyden and Teixeira have predicted for the future.
And good luck bringing California-style governance to its red-state neighbors, which are now filled with ex-Californians who, like Paul Revere, are sounding the alarm about what’s to come.
As former California Assemblyman Chuck DeVore, who now lives in Texas and serves as vice president of the Texas Public Policy Foundation, wrote for Fox News, “California isn’t the future, rather, it’s what America’s 2016 election of Donald Trump saved the nation from becoming. It’s not a harbinger of things to come, but it will soon be an example of the fate we narrowly avoided.”
California’s fall from being the quintessential American dream to a series of gated communities surrounded by poverty is no model for the rest of the country. To the contrary, it is a dire warning.
The year the law creating California’s jungle primary passed has been corrected

No American historical figure, including the Father of Our Country, is safe from the war on history.
The San Francisco School Board voted 4-3 Tuesday not to tear down a mural at a local high school depicting the life of George Washington.
The school board decided to cover the painting instead—hardly a better solution to the supposed offense.
The school board said the George Washington mural “traumatizes students” and “glorifies slavery, genocide, colonization, manifest destiny, white supremacy, oppression, etc.,” according to The Wall Street Journal.
Jon Golinger, executive director of the Coalition to Protect Public Art, an organization dedicated to preserving the mural, said of the decision: “While it is a step in the right direction to take permanent destruction off the table, we will continue to strongly oppose spending $815,000 to permanently wall off the murals so nobody has the choice to see them or learn from them.”
New images covering the original mural, according to School Board President Stevon Cook, will depict “the heroism of people of color in America, how we have fought against and continue to battle discrimination, racism, hatred, and poverty.” 
One of the remarkable aspects of this whole debate—besides the fact that a school was seriously considering destroying a piece of art—is the fact that the mural originally was meant to create a less flattering portrayal of Washington.
It was painted in 1936 by artist Victor Arnautoff, a man of the far left in his own time. 
According to historian Fergus M. Bordewich, Arnautoff included images of slavery and violence against Indians as a way to present a less glamorized view of Washington. Bordewich wrote in April:
[Arnautoff] included those images not to glorify Washington, but rather to provoke a nuanced evaluation of his legacy. The scene with the dead Native American, for instance, calls attention to the price of ‘manifest destiny.’ Arnautoff’s murals also portray the slaves with humanity and the several live Indians as vigorous and manly.
Those who condemn the murals have misunderstood it, seeing only what they sought to find. They’ve also got their history seriously wrong. Washington did own slaves—124 men, women, and children—and oversaw many more who belonged to his wife’s family. But by his later years he had evolved into a proto-abolitionist, a remarkable ethical journey for a man of his time, place, and class.
So we are now squabbling with the past over exactly how to negatively portray American history. A single misstep or disagreement means erasure.
History must be squeezed and jabbed and manipulated to fit our exact conception of how the present should be; it’s an ethos that exposes the additional problem with the seemingly reasonable suggestions that statues, memorials, and murals be consigned to a museum and given “context.”
The problem is, removing a memorial from its original place already takes it out of context. Worse, the work of art or piece of history—whatever it may be—is increasingly likely to be subjected to hectoring and ideologically blinkered screeds aimed at modern political opponents.
History will take a back seat to ideology.
Perhaps, at the end of the day, we should expect Americans to make the best judgments about history themselves.
That’s not good enough for far-left activists, who are less concerned with creating new monuments to worthy Americans and more interested in seeking out and destroying everything that stands as a proxy for what they hate.
And their hate runs deep.
It seems, especially given what polls suggest about the various statue controversies, most of this movement is being driven by bureaucrats and a relentless faction of other engaged activists rather than the American people as a whole.
Nevertheless, these activists have been effective at pushing their agenda at the national level down to the local level.
Controversies are created where there is none, grievance merchants stay in business, and ideologues who want to deconstruct America to fit their worldview get their way.
It’s ugly business and does nothing to stop racism or end prejudice. If anything, this behavior heightens the politics of sheer power and annihilation. 
The message is: Everything we disagree with must be silenced or destroyed; the world must be remade in whatever image we desire—regardless of truth or those who dissent.
What this incident will hopefully elucidate is that the war on history and statues was never simply about history, per se. One can debate the nature of Confederate statues or the merits of individual historical figures marked for destruction, but that misses the larger aims of this movement.
The movement intends to create indelible identities of oppressor and oppressed where “my truth” is more important than “the truth,” and bonds of American solidarity and concepts such as e pluribus unum—out of many, one—are made unworkable.
And that outcome is what Americans of goodwill must oppose at every turn.
As I wrote in May, when this battle over the Washington mural began heating up: “These movements are forcing politics to infect every corner of our existence, and that weakens this country. It makes us more hateful toward one another and trains us in the un-American notion that to win arguments, we must quash, liquidate, and erase from all memory those we disagree with.”
For this reason, we must stand up and defend our shared American history, to oppose the erasure of old statues and monuments, and relentlessly work to bring informed patriotism to generations of Americans who have been stripped of that virtue.

California is often held up as a bastion of progressivism and equality.
However, the reality is that the state is increasingly becoming a place only for the very rich and very poor, with little in between.
The latest wildfires and power blackouts in California are—like so many of the state’s bad public policies—putting the hurt on the state’s beleaguered middle class.
While there are certainly problems facing other states across the nation, California’s dysfunction comes into sharp focus because of its huge population, prestige, and insistence on being a progressive standard-bearer.
Businesses, especially supermarkets and others that sell and use perishable goods, are taking a sizable hit to their bottom lines.
According to a report by KRON-TV Channel 4 in San Francisco, a small, family-owned supermarket in San Rafael estimated that it lost $200,000 due to a recent power shutoff in Marin County. For many small businesses, which often run on very tight margins, those sorts of losses can be devastating.
And the total cost to the state will likely be in the billions of dollars. Even for an economic giant like California, that’s unsustainable.  
Businesses already have to deal with a challenging tax and regulatory environment in California. But for those that sustain massive losses every time the power shuts off—which could become a frequent event now, unless a dramatic change in policies occurs quickly—the cost of doing business there may just be too much.
Of course, the powers that be in California are trying to shift the blame for this politician-made, preventable disaster onto climate change, corporate “greed,” and President Donald Trump.
USA Today reported that California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said the whole mess was “not a climate change story as much as a story about greed and mismanagement over the course of decades. … Neglect. A desire to advance not public safety, but profits.”
The fact is, it was the state’s overwhelming desire to go green that pushed PG&E, a powerful state utility with a government-backed monopoly, to skimp on safety and measures that could have lessened fire risks.
Additionally, Trump is correct to point out that environmentalism and poor land management have played a huge role in making California, which has historically had a hot, dry fire season, a tinderbox ready to ignite.
PG&E, with the blessing of the governor-appointed and legislature-approved California Public Utilities Commission, is allowed to mandate power shut-offs at the peak of fire season to limit the damage to the state, which bankrupted the utility in January.
The current proposals to rectify the situation—like having the state take over PG&E—would only make things worse, especially for the middle class.
As The Wall Street Journal noted about plans for a state takeover of PG&E:
Democrats are accusing PG&E of putting profits over safety, but the utilities commission approves its return on equity based on what’s needed to attract private investment. Utility shareholders are typically older folks who rely on dividends for a reliable stream of income—not billionaire hedge funds.
Older, middle-class Californians will lose their investments, and the cost of energy will necessarily skyrocket.
Add it all up, and the future of the Golden State is looking quite dark.
California already has some of the highest gasoline prices in the nation, an absurd cost of living and housing (which has driven many to flee to the rural areas with high fire risks), exploding homelessness and crime, and a one-party political system that offers no real alternatives.
Even the concept of citizenship is breaking down, with absurd laws now allowing illegal immigrants serve on government boards and commissions, leaving little reason for many to be invested in the state’s future.
With this additional blow during fire season—which is crushing businesses, and making many Californians feel like they are living in a Third World country—there will be even more pressure on the middle class to pull up stakes and leave.
That’s hardly a good sign for a sustainable future.
“The state’s elite took revolving-door entries and exits for granted,” wrote historian Victor Davis Hanson, a California native. “They assumed that California was so naturally rich, beautiful, and well-endowed that there would always be thousands of newcomers who would queue up for the weather, the shore, the mountains, and the hip culture.”
But now California “is nearing the logical limits of progressive adventurism in policy and politics,” Hanson wrote.
Eventually, what’s lost won’t be replaced.
California, a state that once set the standards for prosperity and the American dream for the rest of the country, will be little more than a dire warning of how economic blessings can be squandered in a generation.

"George Washington was once so highly respected in America that his home at Mount Vernon, in Virginia, was neutral ground during the Civil War. (Photo:

They finally came for George Washington.
The perpetual war on history now has the father of our country in its sights as the San Francisco Board of Education considers removing a mural of Washington from a local school.
If the board succeeds in politicizing Washington, whose legacy was once so secured and uniting that his home at Mount Vernon was considered neutral ground during the Civil War, then we have clearly crossed the Rubicon of social division.
Critics of the mural point out that, in addition to Washington, it also depicts slaves and Native Americans—and one of the Native Americans appears to be dead.
They have called the artwork offensive, and the school board says it “traumatizes students” and “glorifies slavery, genocide, colonization, manifest destiny, white supremacy, oppression, etc.,” according to The Wall Street Journal.
But the original intent of the mural was actually the exact opposite.
It was painted in 1936 by artist Victor Arnautoff, a man of the left in his own time who, according to historian Fergus M. Bordewich, wanted to depict Washington in a less glamorized way by including images of disturbing realities. Bordewich explained:
[Arnautoff] included those images not to glorify Washington, but rather to provoke a nuanced evaluation of his legacy. The scene with the dead Native American, for instance, calls attention to the price of ‘manifest destiny.’ Arnautoff’s murals also portray the slaves with humanity and the several live Indians as vigorous and manly.
Those who condemn the murals have misunderstood it, seeing only what they sought to find. They’ve also got their history seriously wrong. Washington did own slaves—124 men, women and children—and oversaw many more who belonged to his wife’s family. But by his later years he had evolved into a proto-abolitionist, a remarkable ethical journey for a man of his time, place, and class.
No matter to the modern iconoclasts. It’s too much to expect one to think about what one is rushing to destroy. Obliterate now and ask questions, well, never.
This is just the latest example of attempts to purge American history of its historical figures. Not only is this trend wildly misguided—how destroying statues and paintings bring an end to racism and prejudice is never fully explained—but it also cheapens the debate over America’s past by ignoring nuance.
From the beginning, it was clear that this movement had far less to do with genuinely criticizing past historical figures, but instead reflected the need of modern radicals to feel good about themselves and think they are “doing something” to stop oppression, be it real or imaginary.
Reflection and thoughtfulness are uncomfortable impediments to those who never dare question whether they are on the “right side of history.”
It makes sense that the same people who seek to de-platform individuals for wrongthink on social media and shut down controversial speakers at universities are the same people who want to erase artwork and monuments. The common thread is for their views to be constantly reinforced and never challenged from without.
The unthinking maxims of intersectionality and identity politics must be recited over and over again from all sectors of society. No alternate views can be tolerated. Such teachings soothe the minds of radicals who can easily ignore the moral complications of life from the safe comforts of their college campuses and public buildings. (Those, of course, are made possible by the wicked people they seek to extinguish.)
Doubt, skepticism, and the use of reason are uncomfortable and problematic.
It didn’t take long for the iconoclasts to move from Jefferson Davis to Thomas Jefferson, and then from Jefferson to the most revered of our Founding Fathers, George Washington.
What’s truly revealing about the empty, surface-level nature of these efforts is how little cost is involved for those doing the erasing.
Criticizing slavery and racism in 2019 can get one tenure, public office, and a six-figure salary as a corporate consultant. So brave.
It’s easy to cover up or take down a painting, not so easy to sacrifice the immense benefits of living in the prosperous constitutional republic that problematic men like Washington created.
As David Marcus wrote for The Federalist, it was easy to get rid of Kate Smith’s “God Bless America” recording at Yankee games due to her singing what are now considered offensive songs in the 1930s—but are Yankee fans willing to abolish the Yankees themselves because of their team’s historical role in segregation?
For that matter, are Harvard University administrators and professors willing to give up their jobs at an institution founded in part by a man who owned slaves because its origin was problematic?
Not likely.
It’s far more satisfying to take the less costly step of tearing down a painting or a statue. And it’s much easier to avoid the complicated fact that so many of these supposedly ignorant and prejudiced people built the very institutions they enjoy today.
In their simplistic thinking, surely those who founded a free republic based on consent, and truly “broke the wheel” of tyranny that had been the norm for virtually all of human history, couldn’t be great if slavery was still a part of their heritage.
They failed to live up to their own ideals, so they best be erased.
But to follow this logic forward, we can’t stop with the Founders.
The over half-million Americans who lost their lives and countless others who risked them to end slavery, the “original sin” of this country, also weren’t so great, you see.
Their skin was generally too fair, their motivations insufficiently pure, and most were undoubtedly homophobes who couldn’t have conceived of modern concepts like gay marriage or a man literally becoming a woman.
How can men like President William McKinley, who could simply be attacked for other reasons, be celebrated?
They can’t. They too must be obliterated.
Greatness, according to the history erasers, truly belongs to the wokescolds who wage hashtag campaigns to raise awareness about offensive art and ensure society conforms to their ever-evolving whims.
But the truth is, those who wage war on America’s history are tacitly acknowledging the benefits of living in America, a free country that allows them to pursue their radical activism, even though it is antithetical to the founding ideals that enable free speech.
These movements are forcing politics to infect every corner of our existence, and that weakens this country. It makes us more hateful toward one another and trains us in the un-American notion that to win arguments, we must quash, liquidate, and erase from all memory those we disagree with.
The Washington mural may come down in San Francisco, but the real damage is not being done to the art. It’s being done to the legacy of Washington, to ourselves.
The past is an easy target for iconoclast bullies, but if Americans don’t want them to keep winning, they will have to begin standing up and speaking out against them.
If not, the destruction of our statues and artwork will merely be symbolic of the destruction done to our country at large.

"Rapper Jay-Z remarked that fatherless homes cause boys to rebel. (Photo: Shareif Ziyadat/Getty Images)
Hip-hop mogul Jay-Z is drawing belated condemnation on Twitter for attributing “adverse feeling for authority” to fatherless households during a panel discussion on social justice earlier this year.
Videos of the rapper—whose given name is Shawn—discussing single-parent households on a race-relations panel recently surfaced and went viral.
In the clip from the January discussion, Jay-Z, 49, remarked that fatherless homes cause boys to rebel against the police and “people to lose lives” when interacting with police.
“You think about the idea of growing up in a single-parent house, which I grew up in … and having an adverse feeling for authority,” said Jay-Z, the first billionaire hip-hop artist and entrepreneur.
“Your father’s gone, so you’re like, ‘I hate my dad. Don’t nobody tell me what to do,” he said. “I’m the man of the house. And then you hit the street, and you run into a police officer, and his first thing is ‘Put your hands up, freeze, shut up … you like … F— you!’”
He added, “That interaction causes people to lose lives.”
Jay-Z’s comments stirred controversy in the face of claims of police brutality against unarmed black men that have spawned national protests and the Black Lives Matter movement, an advocacy group that lobbies for criminal justice reform.
Several Twitter users fired back at Jay-Z, calling his statement “false” and accusing him of “blaming” black people for police brutality.
The rapper hasn’t responded to the criticism he’s received for his remarks.
Another clip of Jay-Z, in the same panel discussion, shows him saying, “We don’t want the people [who are] in charge of the police areas to be in danger, either. We want to be very clear, you know: If someone commits a crime, they should go to jail.”
He also said the broken family structure “affects everyone,” including “hardworking taxpayers” and “police officer families.”
The panel discussion took place Jan. 23 at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City, where the creation of a new criminal justice organization called the Reform Alliance was announced. The aim of the initiative is to remove “one million people from the criminal justice system within five years.” CNN commentator Van Jones, an adviser to then-President Barack Obama, was named as its CEO.
Other panelists included rapper Meek Mill and New England Patriots NFL football team owner Robert Kraft, along with Michael Rubin and Clara Wu Tsai, the co-owners of the Philadelphia 76ers and Brooklyn Nets NBA basketball teams, respectively.
No stranger to controversy, Jay-Z also drew criticism recently for excluding outspoken former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick from his social justice partnership with the league, which was announced on Aug. 13.
Jay-Z is not the only rapper to draw a backlash for raising the problem of single-parent households. Rapper Kanye West, a past frequent collaborator with Jay-Z, addressed fatherless homes and has openly supported President Donald Trump.
During a rant on “Saturday Night Live” on Oct. 5, 2018, West said, “The blacks want always Democrats … you know, it’s like the plan they did, to take the fathers out the home and put them on welfare … . Does anybody know about that? That’s a Democratic plan.”
West also received criticism on Twitter for his support of Trump.

"NAACP chapters in California appear to agree with Education Secretary Betsy DeVos that charter schools offer valuable opportunities to black students. Pictured: DeVos testifies March 28 during a Senate subcommittee hearing. (Photo: Zach Gibson/Getty Images)
The NAACP’s support for a moratorium on new charter schools across America has put the nation’s oldest civil rights group at odds with three of its local branches—and in California, of all places.  
Not only that, but the local NAACP chapters appear to agree with Education Secretary Betsy DeVos that charter schools offer valuable opportunities to black students.
DeVos, a longtime school choice advocate who some on the left paint as anti-minority, says the NAACP’s adoption of a charter school moratorium three years ago doesn’t reflect the views of black parents and students she has spoken with. 
“There’s a disconnect between the leadership of the national [NAACP] organization and some of the local chapters … and parents and students,” DeVos said in a recent interview with LA School Report. “I think there is a clear disconnect.” 
The San Diego, Southwest Riverside, and San Bernardino NAACP branches of the California Hawaii NAACP cover territory that holds California’s largest population of black students. 
All three branches submitted resolutions to the state NAACP’s board opposing the national organization’s 2016 ratification of a resolution calling for a moratorium on charter school expansion. 
The NAACP’s Position
The NAACP resolution called for a moratorium on charter school expansion until: 
—Charter schools are subject to the same transparency and accountability standards as public schools. 
 —Public funds are not diverted to charter schools at the expense of the public school system.  —Charter schools cease expelling students that public schools have a duty to educate.   —Charter schools cease to perpetuate de facto segregation of the highest performing children from those whose aspirations may be high but whose talents are not yet as obvious. 
Some local NAACP branches, however, offered their own resolutions to end the moratorium on opening new charter schools.
“We’re hopeful that it can be adopted in California, and then the national board will do their research and investigate the facts in order to look at this again from the perspective of what is really going on with the African American students locally, statewide, and nationally,” said Christina Laster, education chairwoman for the NAACP’s Southwest Riverside branch.
Under NAACP rules, a local branch can submit a resolution when it disagrees with the national board. The national board will review the resolution before the group’s annual convention, but all branches ultimately must abide by policies set from the top.
‘Breaking Ranks’
“It sounds like NAACP branches are breaking ranks with the California state NAACP and national board,” Myrna Castrejón, president and CEO of the California Charter Schools Association, told LA School Report. 
“Everybody knows black students are the lowest-performing subgroup, other than students with special needs, and the system has done nothing to provide targeted support,” Castrejón said.
According to the San Diego NAACP branch’s resolution, African American student groups have a “severe and persistent” achievement gap throughout the state in math and English language arts. 
The resolution also notes how well African American students are performing in charter schools compared to traditional public schools. Only 10 public schools in California with a majority African American student enrollment fall in the top half of student performance statewide in English and math, according to the resolution, but eight of the 10 are public charter schools.
“I think they’re totally mistaken,” DeVos said about supporters of a charter school moratorium in California in the LA School Report interview, “and they’re not really acting or speaking in the best interests of those they profess to represent.” 
The secretary of education said that one need only talk to a student who has benefited from school choice to understand her point of view. 
The California Hawaii NAACP has called for the three local branches to “rescind their position because it conflicts with the state branch position” as led by its education chairman, Julian Vasquez Heilig. 
No Standing?
“I don’t think anybody would characterize Betsy DeVos as a civil rights leader,” Vasquez Heilig said in a phone interview Monday with The Daily Signal. “I just don’t think she really has any standing in this conversation.”
Vasquez Heilig has been at the forefront of the national NAACP board’s push for charter school restrictions in California as a professor of educational leadership at California State University, Sacramento. In early June, he was named dean of the University of Kentucky College of Education and was expected to take that post this month.  
Vasquez Heilig told The Daily Signal that charter schools in California lack accountability and transparency. 
“We haven’t made any modifications to the California charter school law in decades,” he said. 
But Brittany Chord Parmley, a spokeswoman for the California Charter School Association, sharply criticized the national NAACP’s education chairman.
“Julian Vasquez Heilig hacked the NAACP to serve his own anti-charter political agenda,” Parmley told The Daily Signal in an email. “Shame on him for exploiting a trusted civil rights organization to trap black kids in failing schools and deny black parents the right to choose where their children go to school.”
“Everybody knows black kids are being massively failed by the public school system,” she added. “It’s ironic that Dr. Heilig would try and shut down those within the NAACP who support public charter schools from using the same resolution process he used himself to call for a moratorium. Sure doesn’t sound very democratic.” 
Vasquez Heilig brushed off such criticism, saying:
I think everybody is very aware that while the California Charter School Association will tell anybody who will listen to them that they’re in favor of transparency and accountability for charter schools, behind the scenes, they’re spending tens of millions of dollars and working hard to make sure that does not happen.
Legislation in Play
California lawmakers in May withdrew two bills that would have threatened the growth of charter schools: Assembly Bill 1506, which sought to cap that growth, and Senate Bill 756, which would have imposed a two-year moratorium on charter schools. 
The bills were part of a package of four measures to restrict charter schools, first introduced in February by Assemblyman Patrick O’Donnell, D-Long Beach, chairman of the Assembly Education Committee. 
O’Donnell said the bills would ensure officials “make responsible and informed decisions” and would be “critical for student success and taxpayer accountability.” 
Vasquez Heilig supported the two remaining bills, Assembly Bill 1505 and Assembly Bill 1507, which the lower chamber passed in May and sent to the state Senate. 
AB 1505 would give local school districts exclusive authority to approve new charter schools. The bill also would allow districts to assess a proposed charter school’s budget impact during that approval process, and rescind existing law that gives charter school officials the right to appeal a denial. 
Vasquez Heilig has said the measure is “commonsense transparency and accountability, and has a really good shot in the state Senate.”
The second remaining bill, AB 1507, would amend current law to prohibit a charter school from being located outside district boundaries when organizers can’t otherwise find a facility. Critics say such situations create budget costs for the adopted district. 
Both bills are endorsed by the California Teachers Association as well as the California Hawaii NAACP.

"As the oldest and largest civil rights nonprofit in the U.S., the NAACP joins the 87 House members who support an impeachment of President Donald Trump. Pictured: Trump walks from the Oval Office to board Marine One on July 17. (Photo: Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post/Getty Images)
The NAACP is calling for President Donald Trump’s impeachment following a speech made by a stalwart of the effort at the group’s annual convention Tuesday.  
“We have in the White House a person who is ruthless and lawless, and I am a person who believes that such a person should not occupy the White House in the United States of America,” Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, told the crowd at the civil rights group’s gathering in Detroit.
Derrick Johnson, NAACP CEO and president, announced via Twitter that the organization’s national delegation voted unanimously in favor of a resolution to “initiate the Articles of Impeachment for Donald J. Trump.” The resolution was voted on during the convention.
“The pattern of Trump’s misconduct is unmistakable and has proven time and time again, that he is unfit to serve as the president of this country,” said Johnson. 
The group cites numerous reasons for impeaching the president, including “his attempts to curtail the scope of Robert Mueller’s Investigation” and “his numerous attempts to avert the Supreme Court’s decision to not add in the citizenship question to the 2020 Census.”
The NAACP also branded the Trump administration as “one of the most racist and xenophobic” since the era of “Jim Crow” for its “caging immigrant children without food or water” and for his controversial tweet “calling out minority congresswomen and telling them to go back to their countries.”
As the oldest and largest civil rights nonprofit in the U.S., the NAACP will join the 87 House members who support an impeachment of the president, including Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., who said at the convention that she is “not going nowhere, not until I impeach this president.” 
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who was also one of the speakers at the convention, did not reference Trump during her speech. She has resisted recurring calls for pursuing impeachment.
Going against the grain of the speaker, Green has a record of pushing impeachment measures in the House of Representatives. His latest attempt was defeated last week in the House with a vote of 332-95. Of the 85 Democrats who have voiced their support for starting the impeachment process, 14 joined Republicans in killing Green’s resolution. 
Green introduced privileged impeachment resolutions in December 2017 and January 2018, which were ultimately unsuccessful.

"The latest findings from the Gallup polling organization make 2019 the year with the highest mentions of immigration as a big concern. Pictured: Migrant families wait June 21 in McAllen, Texas, for transport in an area that U.S. Border Patrol agents use to quickly check health and identification information and to provide snacks, diapers, and water.  (Photo: Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post/Getty Images)
July saw a record high of Americans who identified immigration as “the most important problem” facing the United States, according to a new poll. 
The Gallup polling organization first noted the increased number of immigration mentions from those polled reaching its highest point in June at 23%, but July broke that record with mentions climbing to 27%.
These findings make 2019 the year with the highest mentions of immigration, which first began in 1993, Gallup said. Since then, an average of 6% of Americans have mentioned the issue. 
The latest polling, Gallup said, stems from the U.S. government’s continued attempts to manage the influx of Central American immigrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. Gallup attributed the historic uptick to the “dramatic images of overcrowded detention centers” and descriptions of the situation as “a crisis” by representatives of both major political parties.
Despite differences on how to solve that crisis, Congress and President Donald Trump worked together to enact legislation in June adding more than $4 billion with the goal of alleviating problems at the border. The legislation included support of migrant children held in U.S. custody.
Though the public acknowledges immigration as a top issue weighing on the country, Gallup’s poll found that 76% say legal immigration is a good thing for the country—the highest figure for the question since Gallup starting asking it in 2001. This compares with 19% this year who say it is a bad thing. 
Coming in as the second most important problem facing America, according to Gallup, is “the government/poor leadership,” with 23% mentioning it.

"Robert Johnson, right, the founder of Black Entertainment Television, and his wife Lauren Wooden, left, arrive for a meeting with President-elect Donald Trump at Trump National Golf Club on Nov. 20, 2016, in Bedminster Township, New Jersey. (Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty Images)
An unexpected critic of the Democratic Party known as America’s first African American billionaire says the party is becoming too liberal, and shared his straightforward commendation for President Donald Trump’s economy. 
“The party, in my opinion, for me personally, has moved too far to the left,” said Robert Johnson, founder of the cable network Black Entertainment Television and RLJ Companies, during a Tuesday interview with CNBC’s Hadley Gamble. 
A self-proclaimed Democrat and centrist, Johnson, 73, went on to say, “And for that reason, I don’t have a particular candidate [I’m supporting] in the party at this time. I think at the end of the day, if a Democrat is going to beat Trump, then that person, he or she, will have to move to the center and you can’t wait too long to do that.”
“I think the economy is doing great, and it’s reaching populations that heretofore had very bad problems in terms of jobs and employment and the opportunities that come with employment … so African American unemployment is at its lowest level, ” Johnson said.
According to Forbes, Johnson became the first African American billionaire in the United States for selling Black Entertainment Television to Viacom in 2001 for $3 billion. Founded by Johnson in 1980 with a $15,000 loan, Black Entertainment Television reached an estimated 62.4 million homes. He served as president and CEO until 2005.
Johnson criticized the American political establishment in his CNBC interview as “very wicked and very mean,” but praised Trump for helping the African American community. 
“I give the president a lot of credit for moving the economy in a positive direction that’s benefiting a large amount of Americans,” he said. “I think the tax cuts clearly helped stimulate the economy. I think business people have more confidence in the way the economy is going.”
“Overall, if you look at the U.S. economy … you got to give the president an A+ for that,” he added.
When asked about Trump’s style being considered as divisive by many Americans, Johnson responded, “A lot of people are not going to like that style, but, when he says he’s going to try to do something economically, you have to give him credit for taking some specific steps to do that.”
“At the end of the day, the American people are looking for someone who can deliver economically and deliver on opportunities,” he added.
Johnson reportedly favored Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential race, but the media mogul met with Trump after his victory to discuss what he referred to as “business solutions to social problems,” and encouraged African Americans to give the new president “the benefit of the doubt.” 
Johnson has voiced criticisms of both former President Barack Obama andClinton in the past.

"Daniel Cameron, pictured in a campaign video, served as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s legal counsel for two years. (Photo: Daniel Cameron's Twitter account.) 
When he takes office on Dec. 10, Daniel Cameron will make history as Kentucky’s first-ever African American attorney general and its first Republican to hold the office since 1948.
Winning 57.8% of the vote on Nov. 5, Cameron trounced his opponent, former Kentucky Attorney General Greg Stumbo, who was seeking a return to the office he held from 2004 to 2008.
Cameron’s winning margin was even bigger than the one with which he won the May 21 Republican primary, defeating state Sen. Wil Schroder with 55.4% of the vote. 
Cameron said his core issue was fighting the drug epidemic in Kentucky.
“Like many Kentuckians, I’ve seen too many families torn apart by drug abuse,” he had said in announcing his campaign. “The attorney general should be the leading voice in confronting this challenge, and I believe that I am the right candidate for the job.”
He also campaigned on his opposition to abortion, gun control, and illegal immigration. 
Cameron’s key campaign promise was that he would restore credibility to the attorney general’s office and “return it to its position as the chief law enforcement officer of the commonwealth of Kentucky.”
The Elizabethtown, Kentucky, native said the position should be depoliticized, as attorneys general have a responsibility to “enforce the laws that are passed by the General Assembly and signed by the governor, regardless of who that is.” 
Kentucky’s next governor will be the man he will replace as attorney general, Andy Beshear, a Democrat who narrowly defeated the Republican incumbent, Matt Bevin.
With his win, Cameron joins the ranks of five other black state attorneys general—Curtis Hill in Indiana, Letitia James in New York, Kwame Raoul in Illinois, Aaron Ford in Nevada, and Keith Ellison in Minnesota—as well as Karl Racine, the attorney general of the District of Columbia. Hill is the only other Republican. 
Here are five things to know about Kentucky’s attorney general-elect.
1.  Served as McConnell’s Legal Counsel
When Cameron attended John Hardin High School in Elizabethtown, he won a scholarship named in honor of Mitch McConnell, the state’s longtime Republican senator, to attend the University of Louisville. 
Cameron earned a bachelor’s degree in political science in 2008 and a law degree in 2011 from the university’s Brandeis School of Law. He was a member of its law review, president of the student bar association, and was chosen by the university to speak at the commencement ceremony. Cameron played defensive back for the university’s football Louisville Cardinals in 2005-2006 while an undergrad.
After a stint with a law firm, he served as McConnell’s legal counsel for two years. In that position, he helped McConnell, now the Senate’s majority leader, make sure that the senator was compliant with Senate ethics rules. 
He also played a role in the scrutiny of federal judicial appointments, and dealt with patent and trademark issues, and with Kentucky telecommunications and broadband-access initiatives.
2. Clerked for a Federal District Court Judge
After law school, Cameron served as a law clerk for Judge Gregory F. Van Tatenhove, a U.S. District Court judge for the Eastern District of Kentucky appointed by President George W. Bush.
3. Was a Private Lawyer and Lobbyist
Cameron passed the Kentucky bar exam in 2011 and engaged in private practice with Stites & Harbison in Louisville. He left the firm to work for McConnell as legal counsel. After that, Cameron joined the law firm of Frost Brown Todd in Louisville, where he has been employed since June 2017.
4. Supported by Trump
Cameron received an endorsement from President Donald Trump after winning the Republican primary. 
The Republican Party has a new STAR, his name is Daniel Cameron (@djaycameron), and he is running for Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Kentucky….
“The Republican Party has a new STAR, his name is Daniel Cameron,” the president tweeted in July. The president added that he supported Cameron’s positions on crime, borders, and gun rights.
Cameron welcomed Trump’s support, saying that he’s a proud Republican and has pledged his support for the president’s conservative policies.

"""Under this president, you see the rising tide lifting all boats, you see low unemployment, record-low for blacks and Hispanics, for all the demographics of our nation,"" Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson says as proof President Donald Trump is not a racist. Pictured: Carson attends the premiere of the film ""Death of a Nation"" at E Street Cinema on Aug. 1, 2018, in Washington, D.C.  (Photo: Shannon Finney/Getty Images)
While many Democrats are accusing President Donald Trump of “racism” because of a controversial tweet, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson is countering the narrative by touting the president’s policies.
“I have an advantage of knowing the president very well, and he’s not a racist, “ Carson said in a Wednesday interview on Fox News’ “America’s Newsroom.” 
“His comments are not racist, but he loves the country very much,” Carson added. “He has a feeling that those who represent the country should love it as well.”
The comments Carson referred to were tweets from the president directed at a group of minority freshman Democratic lawmakers known as “the squad” who have been outspoken in their criticisms of the president and America. 
In his string of tweets, Trump said the group, made up of Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar or Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, and Ayanna Pressley of Illinois, should “go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.” 
All the women are American citizens.
Following Trump’s remarks, House Resolution 489 was introduced in the House Judiciary Committee, a measure that “condemns” the president as “racist” for his “comments about immigrants and asylum-seekers.” 
The measure passed 240-to-187 largely by party lines Tuesday.
When Fox News host Sandra Smith asked Carson, 67, to clarify the president’s statements and his refusal to take them back, he said: 
I think you can see what the president means by looking at his accomplishments. Look at his policies. Under this president, you see the rising tide lifting all boats, you see low unemployment, record-low for blacks and Hispanics, for all the demographics of our nation.

"Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.,  arrives Sept. 25 at a House Democratic Caucus meeting at the Capitol. (Photo: Alex Wong/Getty Images)
Detroit’s chief of police is calling out as “racist” and “insulting” a freshman congresswoman’s criticism of his department’s facial recognition system and the personnel who operate it.
Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., said the Detroit Police Department should hire only black people to analyze photos of criminal suspects in the department’s facial recognition system. 
During a recent visit to the police department, the first-term lawmaker said that “analysts need to be African Americans, not people that are not.” 
“I think non-African Americans think African Americans all look the same,” said Tlaib, who is Palestinian. 
Detroit’s population is nearly 80% black, according to the Census Bureau. 
Detroit Police Chief James Craig, who is black, defended the professionalism of the analysts who use the facial recognition system. Craig added that if he had said what Tlaib said, people would be outraged and “they would be calling for my resignation.” 
Tlaib toured the facility Oct. 3. Craig had invited her to do so after remarks she made Aug. 20 in a tweet criticizing the technology, saying “@detroitpolice You should probably rethink this whole facial-recognition bull—-.”
Following that remark, Craig invited Tlaib, who represents parts of Detroit and some of its suburbs, to the Real Time Crime Center to see how the facial recognition technology and the analysts work.
Tlaib toured the center, which monitors live footage from video cameras on traffic lights, businesses, and elsewhere around the city. Craig and facial recognition analysts showed Tlaib the software used to identify suspects in crimes. 
Facial recognition technology identifies people from live or recorded video or photos, and it compares a person’s facial features with those in a database of photographs of faces or official mugshots. 
The tour, which lasted more than an hour, prompted some contention between Craig and Tlaib over the software, and particularly whether only blacks should work in the crime center to analyze photos flagged by the software. 
“I’ve seen it even on the House floor: People calling Elijah Cummings ‘John Lewis,’ and John Lewis ‘Elijah Cummings,’ and they’re totally different people,” Tlaib said. “I see it all the time, and I love them because they go along with it.” 
Cummings and Lewis are bald, black Democratic congressmen from Maryland and Georgia, respectively. 
Craig took issue with Tlaib’s assertion. 
“I trust people who are trained, regardless of race, regardless of gender. It’s about the training,” he said.
Following Thursday’s tour, though, Tlaib told Detroit’s WDIV-TV: “This is me protecting my residents. My residents asked me to do my job, and my job is to make sure they’re not going to be misidentified, or detained, or falsely arrested because he’s using broken technology.”
Craig said, also on WDIV-TV, that Tlaib’s comments were “insulting” toward the white analysts on his staff.
Craig spoke of a conversation he had with the vice president of the Detroit Police Officers Association union, Ronald Thomas, who the chief said was “infuriated.” 
Craig quoted Thomas as saying: “We would rather that [Tlaib] fight for us, to get us more money, or more jobs.”
The chief added of the union, “And they said, you know, their support for her is in question at this point.”
Tlaib isn’t backing down, however. 
“I stand behind my comments that facial recognition technology is broken and that relying on an analyst that might not be reflective of the suspect is flawed in itself as well,” she said. 
In 2017, the Detroit City Council approved $1 million in funding to purchase the facial recognition software from DataWorks Plus, a company based in Greenville, South Carolina. 
The Detroit Board of Police Commissioners on Sept. 19 approved policies governing use of the technology after some criticism from skeptics.
Although the facial recognition technology would assist law enforcement in solving crimes, critics have raised violation of privacy as an issue. 
In California, state lawmakers passed a bill that would impose a three-year moratorium on use of facial recognition technology on police bodycams. The bill is before Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, who has until Oct. 13 to sign or veto it.

"The U.S. Bureau of Prisons says it is freeing nearly 3,100  federal inmates under new criminal justice reforms. Pictured: A prisoner's hands inside a cell Oct. 14, 2013, at Louisiana State Penitentiary. (Photo: Giles Clarke/Getty Images)
The U.S. Bureau of Prisons is freeing over 3,000 inmates under a criminal justice reform measure, the largest group to be released since President Donald Trump signed the bipartisan First Step Act into law less than seven months ago.
The law’s Second Chance Hiring Program funds job training and re-entry initiatives to help former prisoners gain employment. Trump outlined the major public-private partnership last month at the White House.
The Justice Department announced the release of the inmates Friday, saying it was the result of an increase in “good conduct time” under the First Step Act that rewards prisoners with shorter sentences for good behavior.
“Starting today at prisons around the country, nearly 3,100 inmates are being released from Bureau of Prisons custody due to the increase in good conduct time applied to reduce their sentences under the First Step Act,” Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen told reporters Friday, according to Fox News.
Trump signed the legislation into law Dec. 21. 
The Bureau of Prisons oversees 180,248 federal inmates. Just last month, officials announced the release of 2,200 inmates.
Most of the new inmates set for release had drug-related criminal records and lived in halfway houses across the country, acting Bureau of Prisons chief Hugh Hurwitz said at a news conference in Washington. 
Through the First Step Act, inmates had an opportunity to get their sentence time reduced and participate in recidivism programs.
To prepare for their release, the Justice Department said, the nearly 3,100 inmates worked with probation offices to create “individualized release plans” to “ensure a smooth transition.” 
These plans included drug treatment, post-release employment aid, and youth mentorship, among others. 
The Justice Department also announced 1,691 sentence reductions through retroactive application of the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act, which the agency said reduces “the disparity between crack cocaine and powder cocaine threshold amounts triggering mandatory minimum sentences.”
“Our communities are safer when we do a better job of rehabilitating offenders in our custody and preparing them for a successful transition to life after incarceration,” Attorney General William Barr said in a prepared statement. 
Barr added: “The [Justice] Department is committed to and has been working towards full implementation of the First Step Act, which will help us effectively deploy resources to help reduce risk, recidivism, and crime.”
Another major development related to implementation of the First Step Act is what officials call the Risk and Needs Assessment System.
According to the Justice Department, the system will “help identify all federal inmates who would qualify for pre-release custody by participating in recidivism reduction programming and/or productive activities.”
Congress authorized $75 million for each fiscal year from 2019 to 2023 for the Justice Department to implement the new law. The department already has redirected $75 million for implementation in fiscal 2019, which ends Sept. 30, and said it will work with Congress to ensure more funds are appropriated for future years.

"More parents are taking advantage of school choice policies to place their children in safer schools. (Photo: Klaus Vedfelt/Getty Images)

Jude Schwalbach

Jude Schwalbach is a research assistant in education policy at The Heritage Foundation.
Parents look for many things in a school: strong academics,
engaging extracurricular activities, and quality teachers who offer one-on-one
help to their kids. 
But increasingly, parents are adding safety to their list:
They want a school where their children will feel safe. 
Safety is a growing concern for parents. A 2017
Gallup Survey found that three in 10 parents are concerned for their
children’s safety at school. And it’s no wonder, given what kids are
experiencing.
In the District of Columbia, more than 30% of middle school
students reported being
bullied at school, nearly 10% of high school students say they were threatened
or injured with a weapon on school property, and more than 15%
experienced physical
fights on school property. 
Another 10% said they missed
school because they felt unsafe at school or during their commute.
It’s no surprise that parents, such as those surveyed in Florida
and Indiana,
ranked school safety as one of the top three most important school
characteristics. 
And when parents grow concerned, policymakers begin to take
note. 
Last year, Rep. Jim Banks, R-Ind., proposed a bill introducing child safety accounts. These accounts would help D.C. children who are the victims of bullying, sexual harassment, or violence to pay for tuition, tutoring, books, transportation, and therapy so that they could move to another school. 
Since D.C. is under the jurisdiction of Congress, these accounts
are an appropriate federal measure. 
This proposal would build on existing school choice options
in Washington, D.C., including the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program, which
provides vouchers to children from low-income families to attend a private
school of choice. 
The D.C. proposal takes a cue from Florida, where the Hope
Scholarship Program allows students who are bullied or the victims of
physical attacks to transfer to a school of their choice. 
Charter schools are another solution for parents looking for
safe schools. 
It’s well known that charter schools don’t have the same safety
problems that traditional public schools have. One recent study
found that charter schools were much more likely to report that certain safety
problems, such as students abusing teachers and gang activities, “never occurred.”
In Denver, researchers found that school safety was third
among 18 factors that parents considered when applying to the city’s charter
schools. Likewise, in Pennsylvania, teachers ranked safety as the fourth
most important reason (out of 10) for seeking employment at a charter
school. 
Parents want their children to learn and grow in safe school
environments. The expansion of charter schools, education savings accounts, and
other school choice options means giving power to parents to choose schools
that are the right fit for their children.
Consistent with Robert Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, parents
will prioritize school safety over other school characteristics like academic
achievement. As Milton Friedman noted in his book “Free
to Choose,” “Parents generally have both
greater interest in their children’s schooling and more intimate knowledge of
their capacities and needs than anyone else.” 
National School Choice Week is an opportunity for policymakers
to trust to families to make the best choices for their children’s’ educations.

"Rep. Jim Banks, R-Ind., took steps last month with a new proposal that provides child-safety accounts to children in dangerous school settings in the nation’s capital. (Photo: P_Wei/Getty Images0

Jude Schwalbach

Jude Schwalbach is a research assistant in education policy at The Heritage Foundation.
Gerald
Watson, a high school freshman in Washington, D.C., died in
December after he was chased down and shot 17 times near an after-school
program center. 
His killing occurred less than four miles from the U.S.
Capitol Building.
Watson’s death reverberated through the local community,
affecting its youngest members. Marilyn Wiggins, a volunteer at the TraRon
Center, recalled her grandson struggling in the aftermath of the shooting. 
“Last week, he came and said, ‘I don’t want to die. I’m
scared to die,’” Wiggins said.
Recognizing the reality of unsafe situations for too
many schoolchildren in Washington, D.C., Rep. Jim Banks, R-Ind., took steps last
month with a new
proposal that provides child-safety accounts to children in
dangerous school settings in the nation’s capital. 
Students who suffer from bullying, sexual harassment, or
violence could use their child-safety account to pay for tuition at private
schools of their choice. Instead of being trapped by their ZIP code, children
could attend schools where they can flourish. 
The Independent Institute’s Vicki Alger and Timothy
Benson of the Heartland
Institute noted the helplessness many low-income families face
when their local public school is unsafe. 
“Unless parents can afford to send their children to a
private school or home-school them, their child’s fate is often at the whim of
circumstance and an entrenched bureaucracy,” they explain.
Tragically, the effects of violence are pervasive in
many students’ lives at school and in the surrounding D.C. neighborhoods. 
Even the schoolhouse—long idealized as a refuge for
children—struggles to provide solace and sanctuary.
For instance, more than 30 percent of D.C. middle-school
students reported being
bullied at school. Among D.C. high-school students, nearly 10
percent were threatened
or injured with a weapon on school property, and more than 15
percent of high school students experienced physical
fights on school property. 
In light of their toxic environments, 10
percent of high-school students reported skipping school
in the prior 30 days because they felt unsafe at school or on their way to
school. 
All children deserve an education in a safe and effective
learning environment, and the fact that so many children feel unsafe in the
nation’s capital should be a priority for Congress, since Washington, D.C., is
the only the school district under
congressional authority. 
Banks’ child-safety accounts take ownership of Congress’
special relationship with education in Washington, D.C., and seek to ameliorate
the circumstances of children in unsafe schools. 
In addition, families would be able to use new D.C. tax-credit
scholarships to “top off” their child-safety accounts
for additional expenses. For instance, these scholarships can make the
difference in private-school tuition, pay for textbooks, tutoring, college
courses, and therapy to cope with trauma.
Banks also has introduced a proposal to provide education savings accounts to another group of students that Congress has authority to extend education choice to; namely, students of active-duty military families.  
A safe school environment is one
of the top three factors for parents when choosing a school, as
a recent study by The Heritage Foundation’s Lindsey Burke and EdChoice’s Jason
Bedrick showed. 
And the Independent Institute’s Alger noted parents’
rapidly growing fears about school safety. She
wrote, “Today, one in three parents are fearful about their
child’s physical safety at school—up significantly since 2013, when just over
one in 10 parents expressed such fear.” 
Congress has long recognized its special responsibility
to the children of Washington, D.C., which is one of the most notorious
school districts in the nation. 
In 2003, the life-changing D.C. Opportunity Scholarship
Program was established, providing 1,600 children a year in the District with a
voucher to attend a safe and effective school.
The best way to answer the clamors of parents and
students for safe schools is to empower them with choice. Expanding choice to
students through child-safety accounts is an important policy step in the right
direction to accomplish that goal.

"Moral instruction in schools is extremely important to families. Parents rank moral and character development as one of the top three most important qualities in a school. (Photo: Getty Images)

Jude Schwalbach

Jude Schwalbach is a research assistant in education policy at The Heritage Foundation.
Louisville, Kentucky, public school teacher Paul Barnwell was distressed by his 11th-grade students’ response to this hypothetical moral quandary: “If your significant other commits a felony where people are gravely injured, do you report them to the police?” 
To his dismay, the students resoundingly responded “No!” 
His students’ reaction made Barnwell recognize the
absence of moral instruction and character development in district schools. 
In fact, he argued that moral instruction is often
neglected, since many teachers are overwhelmed by the pressures to focus
instruction on government-assessed standards, such as Common Core, which
he notes “ultimately elevated
standardized testing and severely narrowed curricula.” 
“For many American students who have attended a public
school at some point since 2002, standardized-test preparation and narrowly
defined academic success [have] been the unstated, but de facto, purpose of
their schooling experience,” Barnwell wrote in The
Atlantic. 
Yet moral instruction in schools is extremely important
to families. In particular, parents rank moral and character development as one
of the top three most
important qualities in a school.
The omission of moral instruction in many public schools
cuts against the grain of families who want their children to grow into good
people, not just positive test scores. Families see schools as their partners who
help prepare children for civic participation. 
“[C]ommunities and educational institutions that prepare
students to live out their duties beyond the civic horizon are the essential
substance, the lifeblood, of the American constitutional tradition and American
civic life,” explains Ethics and Public Policy fellow Ian Lindquist in National
Affairs.
Unfortunately, too many educators are unwilling or
unable to engage their students in discussions about ethics. 
Barnwell,
noting the lament of Steve Ellenwood, the director of Boston University’s
Center for Character and Social Responsibility, remarked, “Many educators
‘blithely accept that schools must be value-neutral.’” 
Frustrated with district school homogeneity, families turned to school choice options to fill the void created by district schools’ retreat from moral instruction.
Charter schools have provided a unique education alternative
because they often have greater curricular autonomy and operate with less
funding. 
For instance, dissatisfied Arizona families formed a charter school that emphasized ethics and character development. During the next two decades, their school model expanded into the Great Hearts Academy charter school network, which spans Arizona and Texas and teaches 18,000 students annually.
Great Hearts charter schools, while not religious institutions, developed their own curriculum that emphasizes strong moral instruction. Lindquist noted, “[These] schools are still guided by something they view as transcendent—[human nature], which contains powers that can be cultivated and directed toward excellence or virtue.”
Accordingly, students engage in thoughtful conversations
about justice, civic virtue, and personal responsibility. “Character education
is not old-fashioned, and it’s not about bringing religion into the classroom.
Character education teaches children how to make wise decisions and act on them,”
says English teacher Jessica
Lahey.
The quick expansion of Great Hearts and institutions
like it illustrates how much families value their children’s character
development. Parents are not willing to sacrifice “the
humanity of students for potential academic and intellectual
gain” alone. 
It’s important to note that these changes occurred because parents were empowered with education choices and seized the initiative to implement change. 
In “The
Not-So-Great Society,” Robert Jackson, chief academic officer for
Great Hearts, added: “Classical charter schools are being driven by families,
teachers, and policymakers who value schools founded on the academic and moral
qualities that are essential for sustaining communities.” 
Charter school autonomy allows school leaders and
teachers to create innovative curricula that meets the needs of families. Unlike
behemoth district schools, which are weighed down by bureaucratic regulations
and mandates, charter schools have the agility to grapple with difficult
philosophical and moral questions, an exercise that can imbue students with the
intellectual tools and character development required of productive members of
a free society. 
As University of Arkansas professor Jay
Greene explains, educational
endeavors that focus on local communities succeed, where attempts to reform mammoth
school systems through heavy-handed top-down government approaches have
repeatedly failed.
“A wiser approach is to allow families and communities
to make their own choices about the purpose of education,” Greene wrote. “Doing
so would be more consistent with Americans’ general inclination toward
respecting the liberty of others.” 
Greene’s assessment resonates with Lindquist’s
suggestion that schools and families “are best understood in terms
of generations and centuries, not election and funding cycles.” Parents play an
essential role in school success and should be welcomed as educational
partners.
All parents want their children to grow into healthy
members of society, suggesting a demand for schools that emphasize character
development and civics. Accordingly, policymakers should allow families to form
the schools that reflect their community values.
The success of charter schools such as Great Hearts shows
that there is considerable demand for classical, values-based instruction.
Enabling schools of choice to flourish can meet that demand.

"School choice has found success in the nation's capital through the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program. (Photo:

Jude Schwalbach is a research assistant in education policy at The Heritage Foundation.
Families in the nation’s capital deserve a choice about educating
their children.
This year, Congress has the chance to make changes to the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program—up for reauthorization—that could positively affect the future of D.C. children for decades to come. 
The D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program provides scholarships
to cover private school tuition for low-income children in the nation’s capital.  
The scholarship program has been a major success for participating students. Scholarship recipients have a chance to learn in safe environments, escaping dangerous schools, sexual harassment, and bullying. 
Scholarship students are performing as well as their public school counterparts on tests of academic achievement for one-third of the cost. And they are graduating at a rate of an estimated 21 percentage points higher than their peers who applied for, but did not receive, a scholarship. 
Yet opponents of school choice argue that greater educational choice is unnecessary since there are excess seats in D.C. Public Schools. 
According to The Washington Post, Washington’s deputy mayor of education, Paul Kihn, said, “The city has more than 5,000 empty high school seats and more than 3,600 available middle school slots” in public schools.
The empty seats, however, are the result of parents
looking for an alternative to the traditional public school system. 
In fact, 3,294
new and returning students applied for an opportunity
scholarship this school year, for 1,645 available spaces in the program. To
date, 24,351 students have applied for a scholarship through the Opportunity
Scholarship Program, and 10,701 available scholarships have been provided since
it launched in 2004.  
In addition to many more families applying to the Opportunity
Scholarship Program than available vouchers, there are more than 11,861 children on
the charter school wait list in the District. It’s a
clear sign that families want options.
Parents are understandably seeking out better educational options for their children. Just 2 in 10 eighth-grade students in D.C. Public Schools are proficient in reading or math, as shown on the National Assessment of Educational Progress. 
Unsurprisingly, in 2017, the District of Columbia had the second-lowest attainment rate nationwide with only 73% of seniors graduating. But last year, District of Columbia attainment rates plummeted to 68.5% after an Office of the State Superintendent of Education report found that schools failed to properly report pervasive truancy. 
Perhaps even more concerning, District of Columbia public schools are dangerous. Children regularly self-reported skipping school because they felt unsafe. Their absences are understandable as 30% report being bullied at school, and 1 in 10 report being threatened with a weapon or injured on school property. 
And political elites know the perils of D.C Public
Schools. 
In fact, Jimmy Carter was the only president in office to enroll his child in a D.C. public school in the last century. 
No one should begrudge a president for choosing the best school for his child, but good education and healthy learning environments should be available to all children, not just those whose parents can afford to pay twice: once in taxes for the public system and a second time to pay private school tuition. 
As Patrick
Wolf,
a professor of education at the University of Arkansas, said, “When it comes to
education, how far you go matters more in life than how much you know, so
educational attainment is the best measure of the effectiveness of a choice
program.” 
Education choice in the District is delivering on that
score.
Wolf’s comment supports work done by Ron Haskins, Elizabeth
Sawhill, and Brad Wilcox on the success sequence. Haskins
found that individuals who “finish high school, get a
full-time job, and wait until age 21 to get married and have children” are far
more likely to join the middle class.
Brookings’ Richard Reeves
notes that one factor preventing greater success among
minority children is the fact that they “attend worse schools, in part because
local tax and property laws prevent their parents from moving to neighborhoods
with better schools.”
The D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program, however, breaks
down this barrier that would otherwise bar many low-income and minority
children from better education by breaking the link between housing and
schooling. 
So what should the next steps be for the successful
D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program? As my colleague Lindsey Burke suggests:
And the 11,861 children on the charter school waitlist
should be made eligible for a D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program voucher in
the future. Such an expansion would create massive new educational opportunity
for D.C. families.

"Two means of certifying schoolteachers have diverged in California and Arizona. (Photo: Brittany Murray/MediaNews Group/Long Beach Press-Telegram/Getty Images)

Jude Schwalbach is a research assistant in education policy at The Heritage Foundation.
“Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, / and sorry I could not travel both. / And be one traveler, long I stood / And looked down one as far as I could,” poet Robert Frost wrote in “The Road Not Taken.” 
As with
Frost’s path, two means of certifying schoolteachers have also diverged in
California and Arizona, and one path—the one less taken in most states—is
proving to better serve its teacher and student travelers. 
State
policies governing teacher certification can have a considerable effect on the
educational options to which families have access. 
For example, while families in Arizona enjoy a robust and diverse charter school system, parents in the California, on the other hand, are watching government policies suffocate a popular charter school sector, doing so through numerous regulations, including regulations on the teacher workforce.
This summer,
California policymakers reached a deal that could hamper charter schools’
ability to provide unique learning environments. The proposal would require all
charter school teachers to obtain the same credentials as district school
teachers. 
That would
fundamentally undermine charter school autonomy in one of the areas most
important to charter school leaders; namely, who teaches in their classrooms. 
California already compels charter schools to hire teachers with “a
state-approved credential in all core academic subjects, including English
language arts, math, science, and social studies.” The new regulations would also
require those who teach electives, such as music and art, to obtain
state-approved credentials.
These certifications will cost physical education and music teachers nearly $300, while art teachers will have to pay more than $260. Those costs do not include the time, energy, and transportation teachers will expend to acquire the state-mandated credentials. 
Innovative charter schools are popular with Californians as they enroll about 10% of students. Their popularity increased dramatically in the past decade, which saw enrollment increase by 150%.
Opponents of
charter schools claim that state-mandated teacher credentials are needed to
ensure school quality. Such regulations, however, would vastly limit the pool
of potential teachers, because credentialing is a lengthy and burdensome
process—which research suggests provides limited, if any, value. 
Research
from the Brookings Institution, for example, shows that there is no
difference between teachers who are traditionally certified, alternatively
certified, or not certified at all.

Brookings Institution
Compulsory
certification also means highly qualified professionals with subject-matter
expertise and experience will be barred from bringing their skills to the
classroom, absent a government seal of approval. 
People like Microsoft’s Bill Gates, cellist Yo-Yo Ma, and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice could not teach in their respective fields of computer science, music, or political science without state certification.
The waters
are further muddied since the new skills-based credentials are often conflated with
California’s Certificate of Clearance, which guarantees that prospective
teachers receive the necessary background checks to ensure student safety. 
At the end
of the day, state-required teacher credentialing is a win for teachers unions.
By creating more barriers to the teaching profession, the jobs of unionized
teachers in district schools are artificially protected from charter school
competition. 
As education policy specialist Mike McShane commented in Forbes, “Large, wealthy, incumbent actors can actually start to influence the ways legislation or regulations are written in order to stifle their competition. Traditional teacher preparation programs can lobby states to write regulations that make alternative certification paths more difficult.” 
California’s proposed teacher certification regulations are a clear instance of regulatory capture and aim to strangle charter competition.
Instead of
allowing special-interest groups to drive policy about the personnel decisions
made in local schools, policymakers should follow the lead of Arizona, enabling
school leaders to determine the people and practices that will best serve
students in the state.  
Arizona does not require state certification of charter school teachers, allowing school principals to make hiring decisions independently. Arizona charter schools must specify their teacher qualifications in their charter applications and keep employee resumes and employment histories on hand for parents or anyone else at all times. 
Moreover, Arizona’s policy is complemented by a charter school system that enables families to drive accountability in the sector. Nearly 20% of Arizona students are enrolled in charter schools. 
As researcher Matt Ladner noted in Education Next, “When parents don’t like a school, they can simply vote with their feet, either by withdrawing their children from the school or by not choosing it in the first place. It is, therefore, parents, rather than state officials, who play the primary role in holding Arizona charter schools accountable, in a highly efficient manner.”
While
charter schools are awarded 15-year authorizations in Arizona, most
underperforming charter schools closed within four years of opening because
dissatisfied families left for better schools. 
Attrition,
driven by families leaving due to dissatisfaction, as Ladner explains, creates
strong accountability that shutters underperforming schools before state
officials do.
Arizona’s
free and open education market forces schools to respond to families and orient
their services toward family needs. 
Great Hearts
Academy in Arizona is a superb example of the unique niche charter schools
fill. There, teachers lead students in Socratic Method Seminars (roundtable
discussions) and cultivate virtue in students—one of the most important qualities parents seek in their children’s
schools.
The fruits of Arizona charter school innovation were illustrated in the 2015 National Assessment of Educational Progress results, in which fourth- and eighth-graders in charter schools consistently outperformed their district school peers in math and reading. 
In fact, these charter schools, unlike their district school peers, consistently approximated the national assessment performance of students in Massachusetts, who routinely perform at the top of the pack in the nation.

Arizona
charter schools are achieving their success without state-mandated teacher
certification and heavy-handed regulations. 
“For decades, parents have allowed the $600 billion public education cabal to professionalize them out of the educational equation, basically demanding we shut up, hand our children over, and let the experts do their work,” wrote Education Post CEO Chris Stewart at Project Free Forever. “It hasn’t worked out. Schools today remain mediocre, and education policy offers little hope for systemic change.”
Policymakers
in California would do well to trust the decisions of parents.
“Two roads diverged in a wood, and I – / I took the one less traveled by, / and that has made all the difference,” Frost wrote in the conclusion of his famous poem. 
Freedom for parents to choose and freedom for schools to lead is making all the difference in Arizona. It’s time to make the road less traveled—freedom in education—the norm.

Jude Schwalbach is a research assistant in education policy at The Heritage Foundation.
Last year brought a whirlwind of education opportunities to
Puerto Rican families. 
The island’s first charter school, Proyecto
Vimenti, opened to serve disadvantaged children.
The commonwealth’s legislature approved a private
school scholarship program for children who are bullied, experience sexual
harassment, or who have special needs. 
These were notable victories for families where most have no
alternative education options besides the local public schools. 
Unfortunately, some
have tried to tie recent scandals involving government officials to these
island-wide education reforms. 
For instance, former Puerto Rico Secretary of Education
Julia Keleher, along with five others, was arrested on federal charges of money
laundering, theft, and wire fraud that steered $15.5
million to favored, but unqualified, businesses. 
Only months later, Gov. Ricardo Rossello resigned in the
wake of a volatile 13-day protest instigated by “a massive leak of chats among
Rossello and his aides in which they disparaged his opponents in profane,
sexist language and appeared dismissive of the struggles of ordinary Puerto
Ricans,” SFGate
reported.
Corruption is not new to Puerto Rico. In fact, as a recent Heritage Foundation issue brief noted, in 2018,  that the former Department of Sports and Recreation secretary was cited for “$9.8 million in a ‘kickback, fraud, and money laundering conspiracy’ involving vendors that worked with the territory’s department of education.”  
The inspector general has reported similar findings to
Congress for decades, finding that fraud and corruption are systemic and
pervasive, including among the teachers
unions.
While politicians, bureaucrats, and lobbyists were embroiled in scandals, the school choice reforms introduced in 2018 have been helping children.
For example, the territory’s second charter school, Rosalina
C. Martinez, opened this school year. The school will enroll up to 300
middle and high school students and aims to specifically strengthen student
self-esteem and help children break out of generational cycles of poverty. 
Since more than 40% of families live below the federal
poverty line in Puerto Rico, there are many children who stand to gain from the
charter school’s mission.
Even more children will have access to greater education choice next year since the territory plans to double the number of charter schools. Charter school expansion is capped by a law that says only 10% of Puerto Rico’s schools can attend “alianza (charter) schools.”
This year, Puerto Rico is launching a private school tuition scholarship called the Free School Selection Program. Participation numbers have yet to be released, but Andrew Ujifusa, an editor at Education Week, noted, “Voucher enrollment is capped at 1% of public school students for the upcoming school year, with the cap eventually rising to 3%.”
Charter school and voucher expansion would be a boon to
Puerto Rican children, many of whom have no education options besides their
local public school. Private school is out of reach for most families because
of pervasive poverty, and, more recently, the ravages of Hurricane Maria in
2017.
Puerto Rican children clearly need more education options. The National Assessment of Educational Progress found that fourth- and eighth-graders are five grade levels behind their peers on the mainland in mathematics. 
Moreover, as of 2017, more than a
quarter of Puerto Ricans ages 25 and older did not have a high school
diploma, according to the Census Bureau. 
High school attainment is an important measure of education success. As University of Arkansas professor Patrick Wolf, commented, “When it comes to education, how far you go matters more in life than how much you know.”
Wolf’s remark is confirmed by Ron Haskins, Elizabeth
Sawhill, and Brad Wilcox’s research
on the success sequence, which demonstrates
that those who “finish high school, get a full-time job, and wait until age 21
to get married and have children” are far more likely to join the middle class.
School choice options, such as those in D.C. and Milwaukee,
produced overall positive outcomes for high school attainment. As Puerto Rico’s
school choice programs mature, they will have the opportunity to bear similar
fruit.  
As things stand, the traditional public schools in Puerto
Rico have failed to meet the needs of children for decades, resulting in low
attainment rates and poor performance on national assessments. 
In light of the challenges the territory’s children face,
such as hurricane recovery and widespread poverty, policymakers should abandon
the policies that have repeatedly failed to enrich the lives of children.
Instead, they should grow options that put power back in the hands of parents
and give children the education they deserve.

Jude Schwalbach

Jude Schwalbach is a research assistant in education policy at The Heritage Foundation.
More than a half-century ago, Coretta Scott King addressed Harvard University students in the wake of the assassination of her husband, Martin Luther King Jr. 
She said: 
Today’s student is a serious-minded, independent-thinking individual who seeks to analyze and understand the problems of our society, and find solutions to these problems, which are in keeping with the highest traditions and values of our democratic system. 
Students, according to King, were the future of a more
thoughtful and equal society, and one of the most important tools at their
disposal was the freedom of speech.
Yet, today it seems students have changed. 
Finding solutions to the problems of society remains a
dominant feature of modern universities, but many students have rejected the
former spirit that valued solutions, as King noted, “in keeping with the
highest traditions and values of our democratic system.” 
In fact, instead of engaging in civil dialogue, students
now express outrage at controversial speakers and demand the resignation of
faculty members who refuse to conform to progressive creeds or do not
immediately condone students’ threatening or pernicious actions. 
Worse, often they do this with campus administrators in
tow.
For instance, a left-leaning professor, Bret Weinstein, at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington, who objected to reverse segregation on campus (specifically, a day when white students and faculty were to remain off campus), was hunted by students in 2017 because of his objection. 
Campus security, aware of the situation, recommended
that he remain off campus, since they could not protect him as the college
president had ordered security to “stand down.”  
In 2017, Stanley Kurtz, writing at National Review,  documented dozens
of campus shout-downs across the nation. The presidents of Virginia
Tech
and the University
of Oregon were among those shouted down. 
After police removed protesters interrupting Texas state Rep. Briscoe Cain’s speech at Thurgood Marshall School of Law at Texas Southern University, the university president immediately ended the event. He claimed that scheduling procedures weren’t followed, even though the dean of the law school had approved the event. 
Some argue that such extreme situations result from a
very small, but vocal, group of college students. Most students, instead, choose
to remain silent, rather than risk their friendships and social capital—afraid
they might appear “unwoke.” 
The trend of student silence is especially evident from
the guarded support Sahil Handa received after publicly critiquing the political
tribalization among his fellow Harvard students. 
Handa wrote that he “received well over a hundred notes from students thanking [him] for writing the article.” 
But, he added, “not a single one was shared in public.”
The poignancy of the political atmosphere on college campuses is emphasized by a 2019 Knight Foundation study. It found that “[m]ore than two-thirds (68%) of college students say their campus climate precludes students from expressing their true opinions because their classmates might find it offensive.” 
At the same time, the study found that more than half of
students thought that “shouting down speakers or trying to prevent them from
talking” was either “always” or “sometimes” appropriate.
Although most students condemned violence as a means to stop a speech or rally, 16% of respondents thought violent actions were acceptable either “always” or “sometimes.”
This general opposition to the free exchange of ideas is fundamentally opposed to an environment of open inquiry. Yale University’s Woodward Report outlines the university’s purpose as “[t]o discover and disseminate knowledge by means of research and teaching. To fulfill this function, a free interchange of ideas is necessary … .” 
Accordingly, “the university must do everything possible to ensure within it the fullest degree of intellectual freedom,” it said.
Intimidation and fear impede intellectual freedom.
Growing tribalism means that many students are reticent to engage their peers
in real conversations. 
This silent passivity allowed overzealous administrators
and raucous students to limit the free exchange of ideas on campuses.
Some state policymakers, however, have refused to stand by idly as public universities began to confine free speech activity to narrow, often remote, strips of campus. 
Jonathan Butcher from The Heritage Foundation noted that Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, and Wisconsin have already taken corrective measures by eliminating free speech zones in their public universities. 
Arizona’s free speech protections, in particular, preserve the hallmarks of campus free speech since the “public areas of campus—such as sidewalks and campus lawns—are public forums and are open on the same terms to any speaker.”
Moreover, students who repeatedly infringe on others’
expression of free speech can face expulsion.
It’s unfortunate that policymakers must go to such great
lengths to protect a basic tenet of a free society in public universities. But the
most distressing element of the conflict is the pervasive silence among
students who are unwilling to speak their minds.
Universities were places where students challenged each
other, sometimes fiercely, and engaged in civil discourse.
Coretta Scott King envisioned the modern student as “a significant political actor with amazing power to influence the course of societies all over the world.” However, past students only earned her admiration because they were willing to engage their peers in civil discourse—exercising free speech.
To be worthy of her plaudits, today’s students must break
their silence.

"A 2013 study found that “black students gained the equivalent of 14 days of learning by attending charter schools, but that black students living in poverty saw even greater benefits, the equivalent of 29 days in reading and 36 days in math,"" according to CBS News.

Butler
College Prep, a top-rated charter school on the South
Side of Chicago, provides an atmosphere that reflects and engages the local
community. 
The founder and principal, Christopher Goins, built his school community by intentionally hiring teachers from historically black colleges so students would have relatable role models.
“If [students] don’t love the school and enjoy learning, then they are not going to learn. And it goes back to what research states,” Goins, noting the importance of a tailor-made education, told Ebony magazine. “Those of us who grew up black know that we respond to a supportive family-like environment, a place that understands who we are and appreciates who we are.” 
Butler College Prep is just one example of successful public charter schools that operate with less funding and greater autonomy. 
Instead of being trapped by their ZIP codes, the advent
of charter schools meant that low-income parents were no longer compelled by
the government to send their children to assigned district schools. Parents
could vote with their feet for the first time.
For many low-income families who live in America’s inner
cities, a feeling of helplessness is entrenched by high crime rates, gang
activity, and cycles of intergenerational poverty. So, families are eager for
the chance to choose their children’s schools.
Safety, innovative curricula, and unique missions give
public charter schools the opportunity to impact specific communities and
tailor their programs to them. In fact, charter schools impact
student achievement most among low-income and academically
struggling students.
For example, CBS
News
reported on a 2013 study that found that “black students gained the equivalent
of 14 days of learning by attending charter schools, but that black students
living in poverty saw even greater benefits, the equivalent of 29 days in
reading and 36 days in math.”
But charter schools do more than just increase academic
gains, they create environments where children feel safer and receive character
and values instruction—two of the top
three priorities for parents.
For instance, New York charter schools are safer than
their district school counterparts. As Max
Eden
from the Manhattan Institute observed, “While every charter school is
different, and the advantage is not universal, the conclusion is unmistakable:
From a parent’s perspective, a charter school is frequently the safest option
in the neighborhood.”
Another advantage of charter schools is their autonomy,
which allows them to innovate in the classroom and to create a specialized
environment.
For instance, Democracy Prep, which aims to increase civic participation among low-income and minority students, is a prime example of how charter schools instill values in students. 
Researchers found that students enrolled at Democracy
Prep were more
likely to register to vote and to vote in the 2016 election.
Opponents of charter schools, such as Sen. Bernie
Sanders, I-Vt., argue that charter schools drain funds from district public
schools and prevent integration. In their minds, charter schools need greater
regulations to protect taxpayer dollars.
Higher regulations, however, can have adverse,
unintended consequences. 
Jonathan Butcher, senior policy analyst in the Center
for Education Policy at The Heritage Foundation, discovered public school
districts rife with waste and fraud. 
“There are districts with excess administrative
spending, vacant buildings supported by taxpayer resources, fraud, and theft …
. State lawmakers should require school districts to clean up the books … ,” he wrote.
Similarly, the California Policy Center discovered
wasteful spending in the Los Angeles Unified School District, which provided
pay bumps totaling $519
million annually to teachers who took classes directly related
to any subject taught in the school district. 
Or take the billions
wasted on bumps to teacher salaries due to master’s of arts
degrees. As Harvard economist Thomas
Kane commented, “Paying teachers on the basis of master’s
degrees is equivalent to paying them based on hair color.”
The real drain on school district budgets comes from poor internal management and waste—not from quality charter school alternatives for families. Due to their near-monopoly, district schools lack the market pressures that should incentivize them to respond to student needs.
Charter schools in Wisconsin, on the other hand, achieved
better outcomes than district schools, according to a new study by Corey
DeAngelis of the Reason Foundation. 
He
found that “private
and independent charter schools tend to be more cost-effective than
district-run public schools in the state overall and for the vast majority of
individual cities.”
Similarly, charter
schools in Oakland, California, and in Los Angeles achieved nearly equal
outcomes while only operating at a fraction of the cost (63% and 73%, respectively). 
Additionally, a 2017 meta analysis of the literature on charter schools’ effect on integration found neutral to positive effect overall. 
On the whole, charter schools break up the geographic district school monopoly. But most importantly, parents—not big government—choose the school that best fits their children’s needs. Charter schools empower parents and give many children from low-income families opportunities that they could not otherwise afford.
The first reference to Democracy Prep has been corrected to reflect the school’s correct name.

"Virginia Walden Ford advocated school choice in the nation's capital after being one of the earliest students to attend an integrated school in Arkansas. (Photo: Tom Williams/Roll Call/Getty Images)

Jude Schwalbach

Jude Schwalbach is a research assistant in education policy at The Heritage Foundation.
When Virginia Walden Ford crossed the threshold of her new
high school in Little Rock, Arkansas, as one of the second wave of black
students to integrate the school, little did she know these were her first
steps in a lifetime journey to champion educational opportunity for all
children. 
Ford would go on to help nearly 9,000 children attend their school of choice in Washington, D.C., and her story would be featured in the forthcoming movie “Miss Virginia.”  
During the 1990s, Ford was a single mom of three children in Washington, D.C. She was shocked at the condition of the local public schools, where eighth-graders were performing three grade levels below their peers across the nation in mathematics, according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress. 
As The Washington Post reported, “On average, for each additional year that students stay in DCPS, the less likely they are to succeed, not because they are unable to succeed, but because the system does not prepare them to succeed.”
Moreover, a culture of drugs, crime, and violence was pervasive in D.C.’s low-income neighborhoods in the 1990s. Washington’s rate of violent crime was twice the national average, and nearly two-thirds of the District’s teachers said violent student behavior interfered with teaching, noted The Washington Post in 1996.
In these dismal circumstances, Ford realized her youngest
son, William, already was struggling in the traditional public school and
falling in with the wrong crowd. She knew he could not succeed unless he went
to a school that was a better fit for him.
Fortunately, a neighbor provided a private school
scholarship for William. 
“William was able to attend a school that I chose, that was in his best interest,” Ford said. “ … In a couple of months I saw this child [go from] being a child who hated to go to school, [who] was failing everything, to this kid [who] was just totally engaged in learning. And when I asked him why, he said that for the first time in his educational experience, he felt like people really cared about whether he learned or not.” 
Because of what happened to her son, Ford wanted to help
other children have similar opportunities. She became a leading proponent of
the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program, a private school tuition scholarship
for D.C. children that provides up to $13,000 per year for tuition for students
from low-income families.
The program enables students to escape D.C.’s dangerous
schools where, even today, many
children regularly skip school because they fear bullies, and 1 in 10
students report violent threats or injuries while on school property. 
The scholarship recipients graduated from high school and
college at higher rates, and most importantly, families were freed from the district
school monopoly. 
“I didn’t set out to fight for school choice or speak up for
other children,” Ford said. “I started out as an everyday mother, wanting the
absolute best in opportunities for my kids. I quickly found that drive was
reflected in the hearts and minds of other parents who also felt trapped in an
educational system that was failing their children.”
“Miss Virginia” is
a proper tribute to a woman who selflessly dedicated her life to helping the
nation’s capital’s most vulnerable children.
Although she has returned to Little Rock, the movie telling
Ford’s story will reach her biggest audience yet—the American people.
D.C. locals can view an exclusive “Miss Virginia” pre-screening on Oct. 7, at 6 p.m. in Sidney Harman Hall. 
This article has been corrected to say that Ford helped nearly 9,000 D.C. schoolchildren attend a school of their choice.

"Micro-schools are tiny, autonomous private schools typically enrolling fewer than 70 students. (Photo: Klaus Vedfelt/Getty Images)

Jude Schwalbach

Jude Schwalbach is a research assistant in education policy at The Heritage Foundation.
With the school year in full swing, anxious parents hope
their children are content in their local schools. Families worry about finding
the right school environment for their children, especially since every child
learns differently. 
Take the Gilbert family, in Florida, whose story captures the importance of having multiple education options. 
Four of their five children have special needs, and the family travels “80 miles per day, 180 days a year” to four different schools. But it’s worth it, since Stephanie Gilbert “had no idea how much each child would each change over time, or how their needs would transform as well.”
“The ability to find different schools to meet those
unique and changing needs became invaluable,” she said.
While most parents don’t encounter the hurdles common to
the Gilbert family, most can relate to the struggle of finding the school that
best accommodates their children, especially when families’ education options
are severely restricted due to geographic or financial limitations.
One way educators try to provide alternative schooling
options is by establishing “micro-schools.”
They are tiny, autonomous private schools, typically enrolling fewer than 70 students. Michael B. Horn of Education Next describes “the ethos of micro-schools: a fidelity to personalization and success for all in small communities.”
These schooling options create innovative and
personalized learning experiences for students, such as using multi-age
classrooms or encouraging personal relationships to boost learning. 
Business
Insider points out the benefits of the approach. The “micro-school”
model brings students of all ages into the same classroom, “using technology to
cater the curriculum to each child’s needs.”
“Teachers serve as facilitators, rather than lecturers, and kids learn through projects, not memorization,” it said.
Due to their small size, micro-schools are nimble. As a recent Bellwether Education Partners’ report notes, “There are no administrators. Teachers …  tend to have a real entrepreneurial drive. They want to be in the position to make decisions about the administrative things.”
Many micro-schools are geared toward working with children from low-income families. While private school tuition is often out of reach for low-income families, more than half of micro-schools offer financial aid to upwards of one-third of their student body. For example, The Forest School in Fayetteville, Georgia, offers approximately $4,000 in financial aid per pupil to 20% of its student body.
Yet, even with financial aid, many low-income families struggle to foot the bill. States, however, can help students find their best schooling option by strengthening their school choice policies.
For instance, Arizona policymakers expanded the state’s Empowerment
Scholarship Accounts program to include Native American children on tribal
lands.
With an education savings account, families can pay for private school tuition, online learning, special education services and therapies, private tutors, and a host of other education-related services, products, and providers. 
Native American families immediately put those funds to
good use by creating their own micro-school. 
Hadassah John started a new micro-school, Prenda, on the San Carlos Apache Reservation in Arizona because she was frustrated by the local public school’s failure to prevent bullying or to challenge students. 
The executive editor of RedefinEd, Matthew Ladner, commented on the area surrounding John’s school: “The local school district spends well above the Arizona state average, but earned a letter grade of F from the state. Parent reviews, and even a teacher review, on the Great Schools site are scathing.”
Arizona’s recent reforms were imperative since the
traditional public school at the San Carlos Reservation failed to produce
student growth. 
As Ladner
notes, “All Arizona racial/ethnic subgroups scored equal to or above the
national average on eighth-grade math and reading in 2017 except Native
American students.” 
John’s micro-school will give students the attention and
environment where they can flourish. 
Micro-schools can offer education options to families
who have few other choices. No child’s ZIP code should trap them in a failing
public school, and education savings accounts ensure that families have a
choice. 
Policymakers throughout the nation can empower more
families by letting them choose the school that is the best fit for their
children.

Spending by Washington, D.C., public schools can be difficult to pin down.
Estimates suggest spending is somewhere between $27,000 and $29,000 per child per year, which is roughly double the national average. Assuming $27,000 per student per year, D.C. taxpayers spend about $350,000 on a student from kindergarten through graduation.
One could be forgiven for expecting good educational outcomes for such breathtaking sums. Yet educational outcomes in the District of Columbia are one of the clearest examples of the disconnect between spending and academic achievement.
Recently released National Assessment of Educational Progress scores make that clear.
Although the District has made considerable progress on the national assessment—often referred to as “the nation’s report card”—over the past two decades, the city’s scores for eighth-graders still fall short of the national average by nearly 20 points—approximately two grade levels of learning.
In eighth-grade math, for example, D.C. students scored 16 points below the national average. In reading, D.C. students were 19 points behind their peers across the country.
Proficiency levels in reading and math also leave much to be desired. Among fourth-graders, 32 percent scored proficient or better in math, and 29 percent scored proficient in reading. Just 20 percent of eighth-graders tested proficient or better in reading, and just 21 percent in math.
That’s right: Just two out of 10 eighth-graders in D.C. public schools can read or do math proficiently.
In addition to lackluster academic outcomes, achievement gaps persist among students. If future performance replicates the past 20 years, the reading achievement gap between children from low-income families trail three grade levels behind their more affluent classmates in math.

“Expert-driven” reforms in the District have failed to produce notable improvements. As the Manhattan Institute’s Max Eden and I note:
Education reformers used to celebrate D.C.’s dramatic decline in school suspensions. Then a Washington Post investigation revealed that it was fake; administrators had merely taken suspensions off the books.
The same reformers used to celebrate D.C.’s sharp increase in high-school graduations. Then an NPR investigation revealed that it, too, was fake; almost half of students who missed more than half the year graduated.
There have, however, been some bright spots in the nation’s capital. Although charter schools scored only eight points higher than noncharter schools in eighth-grade math, charters deserve recognition, having achieved better results at significantly lower cost.
And as education scholar Matthew Ladner noted, the charter schools are at a disadvantage, since transfer students often “experience a temporary academic setback.” Consequently, as charter schools become more established with more stable student bodies, they can “improve with age.”
Overall, the scores on “the nation’s report card” illustrate the District of Columbia’s acute need for improved education performance.
The past 20 years illustrate some progress, especially at the fourth-grade level, where students are within one grade level of the national average. However, the slow momentum gained with the fourth-graders does not persist at the eighth-grade level, where students struggle to improve, trailing the national average by 16 to 19 points in math and reading.
In 2003, the city laid the groundwork for what has been the brightest spot in education in the District—namely, the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program.
The D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program—a school voucher program open to students from low-income families—has produced excellent academic attainment results.
Beyond other reasons to applaud the school choice option, such as happier parents and safer students, an experimental evaluation commissioned by the Department of Education found that students who used a scholarship graduated at a rate 21 percentage points higher than their peers who were awarded a voucher but did not use it.
D.C. would be well-served by expanding access to the Opportunity Scholarship Program and by formula-funding the program so that parents can rely on it to be there in the future.
Expanding school choice in D.C. will enhance education at all grade levels because parents will be able to match their children with educational options that are the right fit. Instead of having limited options based largely on where they live, parents empowered by choice can find the school that best fits the academic and social needs of their children.
The National Assessment of Educational Progress scores show that D.C. children remain in dire need of access to better education options. Expanding school choice can make that a reality.

Anti-Catholic prejudice, which spread like gangrene in the 19th and 20th centuries, often manifested itself in so-called Blaine Amendments, which enabled government discrimination against religious families, students, and schools. 
This month, the Supreme Court will have the opportunity to overturn one such law. 
In Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue, the court will examine Montana’s decision to exclude religious schools from its K-12 tax credit scholarship program. 
The scholarship program itself is a good idea—helping parents get their kids into the type of school best suited to their needs. But by citing its Blaine Amendment to lock religious schools out of the program, Montana exerted unconstitutional prejudice.
The Montana program offered a $150 tax credit to private citizens who donate toward scholarships but prohibited families from using the scholarships at religious schools. Montana’s Supreme Court struck down the entire program, and it is this decision the U.S. Supreme Court is being asked to overturn. 
Ultimately,
the state terminated the program because of controversy over the religious
exclusion. That’s when Kendra Espinoza and two other mothers whose children
attend religious schools sued the state of Montana.
But the case raises the broader issue of whether America’s diverse student population is best served by homogeneity or by choice. 
Parents have differing views about the purpose of education. As University of Arkansas professor Jay Greene has written, “Since people have legitimate differences about what constitutes a good life and how children can best be raised for that good life, there will be legitimate differences about the content, manner, and goals of education.” 
The case could determine whether parents are free to determine what type of education will help their children achieve that good life. 
For many families, values-based education is a critical component in preparing their children to be productive members of society. 
A growing body of research demonstrates not only that access to school choice improves academic achievement and attainment, but that private school choice also increases parents’ and students’ perceptions of school safety and has significant positive effects on character development, as seen in increased tolerance, charitable giving, and volunteerism, among other factors. 
Montana’s program benefited all families, but then the state passed a rule to reconcile it with the state Constitution’s “no aid” provision (known as a “Blaine Amendment”). Article 10 of Montana’s Constitution prohibits “aid” from going to “any school … controlled in whole or in part by any church, sect, or denomination.” 
The high court has
commented on the ignoble aims of these amendments in previous cases.
In Mitchell
v. Helms, a 2000 case upholding the use of school vouchers, Justice Clarence
Thomas wrote, “Consideration of the amendment arose at a
time of pervasive hostility to the Catholic Church and to Catholics in general,
and it was an open secret that sectarian was code for Catholic.”
Thirty-seven states brought this prejudice into the 21st century, using these laws to exclude religious entities in a variety of contexts, including school choice. 
The question for the Supreme Court is whether it will allow states to continue to impose disadvantages upon families like Kendra Espinoza’s as they seek to educate their children according to their own beliefs. 
As the Jewish Coalition for Religious Liberty wrote in a friend-of-the-court brief, “The Blaine Amendment forces Jewish parents to confront a Hobson’s choice between their financial security and their community’s religious continuity.” 
For an Orthodox Jewish student, a public school can be a difficult place to fulfill his or her religious obligations. To observe Jewish holidays, they cannot write, use electricity, or travel by car or bus, which means they would need to miss approximately a dozen days of school each year. 
The Anti-Defamation League notes “absence could wrongly convey the message that school or a class is not important to a student or his or her family.” 
In a Jewish day school, these holidays would be observed formally by all. But, for many families the price of Jewish day school is overwhelming. 
Being able to take their share of education funding to a school that aligns with their needs would make a significant difference, putting them on equal terms with students attending non-religious private schools.
The court need only follow its 2017 decision in Trinity Lutheran v. Comer to overturn Montana’s “no aid” provision. 
In that case, Missouri was using its Blaine Amendment to exclude a church-run preschool from a state-funded playground improvement program. 
Writing for the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts announced that “the exclusion of Trinity Lutheran from a public benefit for which it is otherwise qualified, solely because it is a church, is odious to our Constitution … and cannot stand.” 
In the Espinoza case, attorneys for Montana argue that allowing the tax credit to go toward religious schools would force a Jewish resident who doesn’t want to subsidize Christian education to choose between his religious beliefs and the tax credit. 
But excluding religious schools from the tax credit program would not end taxpayer money being directed toward diverse schools. It would simply create a one-way street for the taxes of Jews, Catholics, Muslims, and those of other faiths to go toward secular private and public schools where their children cannot learn according to their religious values and traditions. 
Finally, Montana argues that the Supreme Court’s 2004 decision in Locke v. Davey is controlling. Washington state had a Promise Scholarship Program that prevented college students from using it to study “devotional theology,” although students were permitted to attend religious schools and take religious courses. 
The court upheld the program, explaining that Washington’s decision reflected the “historic and substantial state interest” in declining to subsidize the “essentially religious endeavor” of “[t]raining someone to lead a congregation.”
As the Department of Justice notes, in Trinity Lutheran, the court “interpreted Davey to mean that, where a state denies funds because of what the recipient ‘propose[s] to do’ with those funds, rather than because of the recipient’s identity, the state’s ‘historic’ interests may justify a refusal to fund certain ‘essentially religious endeavor[s].’” 
But Montana has categorically denied funds to religious schools and families because of their status and identity, not because the funds were being used for an essentially religious endeavor or purpose such as clergy training. 
In the Supreme Court’s recent establishment clause decision, American Legion v. American Humanist Association, which permitted a cross-shaped World War 1 memorial to stand, Justice Samuel Alito wrote that “the religion clauses of the Constitution aim to foster a society in which people of all beliefs can live together harmoniously.” 
Similarly, as Greene writes, “Americans’ concern for liberty should incline them toward respecting different approaches to education.”  
In Espinoza, the court should interpret these principles to mean that a state should allow parents to choose how to use a privately funded scholarship administered by the state. 
Protecting religious freedom against official prejudice will foster social harmony by allowing all families to educate the next generation according to their unique values and traditions.

Jonathan Butcher is a senior policy analyst in The Heritage Foundation's Center for Education Policy and a senior fellow for the Goldwater Institute and the Beacon Center of Tennessee.
“This incident that occurred, this outrageous tragedy that
we have had to deal with, we really had no signs, no warning, no tips,” announced
Broward County School Superintendent Robert Runcie on CNN on Feb. 15, 2018.
Runcie was speaking of the tragic school shooting at Marjory
Stoneman Douglas High School that had left 17 students and staff dead the day
before. 
“No signs, no warning.” Well, that’s simply not true.
The confessed shooter in Parkland, Florida, had a long history
of violence that school officials were well-aware of—a history that should have
alerted them to the potential risk. 
Andrew Pollack and Max Eden document this in their new book “Why Meadow Died: The People and Policies that Created the Parkland Shooter and Endanger America’s Students.” Pollack is the father of Meadow, a girl who lost her life on the third floor of Stoneman Douglas that day. 
The warning signs were abundant—from animal torture and
attempted suicide, to bringing knives and bullets to school and an overall
obsession with guns. Police had been called to the shooter’s home 45 times to
deal with incidents involving him or his brother. 
Pollack and Eden identify the shooter throughout by his
prison number, 18-1958. 18-1958 had been in a fight in school, repeatedly
issued death threats to other students, and was prohibited from bringing a
backpack to school so as not to be able to conceal weapons in it. 
Yet as Pollack notes, when the shooter bought his guns, “he
had a totally clean record. On paper, he was a model citizen.” 
How did his record stay so clean?
Pollack and Eden meticulously document that district and
school officials did not stop 18-1958 because of the district’s policy to limit
student suspensions and expulsions. That policy—the PROMISE Program—also
deterred educators from referring students to police. 
Such leniency, Eden argues, meant that officials neglected opportunities to refer 18-1958 to law enforcement, allowing him to avoid arrest, which ultimately made it possible for him to buy a gun.
>>> Same Policies That Failed to Stop Florida Shooter Exist in School Districts Nationwide
While the media at large focused on lack of “gun control” as
the major problem, Pollack and Eden explain that PROMISE and the related rules
on student discipline—which the Obama administration had then promulgated in
school districts across the country—are undeniably at the center of this
tragedy. 
The PROMISE Program “deters teachers from reporting
disciplinary problems and makes administrators less inclined to trust teachers’
intuition and more inclined to make decisions that produce the disciplinary
‘data’ that their district-level superiors want to see,” Pollack and Eden
write.
At every possible turn, the adults in the system ignored glaring warning signs. Pollack and Eden write that 18-1958’s story is “a cautionary tale of what can happen when everyone in a school system has an incentive to do the wrong thing.”  
Pollack and Eden’s book is difficult to read because Pollack’s
pain, sorrow, and frustration is present on nearly every page. Furthermore, the
detailed recounting of the tragedy pulls no punches in identifying the policies
that allowed this disaster to happen. 
“Every step of the way, [district officials] had a choice:
do the responsible thing and help [18-1958], or do the politically correct
thing and ignore him. They made the wrong choice every single time,” Pollack writes
in one section.
>>> 1 Year After Parkland Massacre, Broward County’s School Board Still Failing
The most troubling part of the book, aside from the actual
retelling of the shooting, is the ending. 
After an exhausting effort to change the composition of the
Broward County School Board failed in 2018, the authors express fear that voter
apathy is so deeply-rooted that even a disaster like Parkland is not enough to
get people interested in local elections. 
In his epilogue, Pollack pleads with readers: “You simply
have to step up, get involved, and make a difference for your children. You
can’t let your schools be run like the Broward County Public School District.”
Readers will be left shaking their heads at the district’s systemic
failures, administrators’ abdication of responsibility, and the abundance of
adult negligence. 
Every school leader should read this book and safeguard
against such a lax disciplinary environment being replicated in their districts—and
every parent should read it to hold school officials accountable. Children’s
lives depend on it.

American colleges
and universities are failing in one of their most basic missions: to equip students
with the tools they need for a career. 
Many students graduate ill-prepared to earn a living and pay off
the debt they’ve accumulated getting their degrees—40% of those who start
college don’t finish within six years.
Additionally, students are often subject to indoctrination into socialist ideology. They face hostility toward opinions that don’t conform to the predominantly leftist thinking on campus. 
They’re also immersed in identity politics that pit students of different backgrounds against one another. 
Despite these problems, colleges continue to raise tuition. Because federal loan money is handed out with little scrutiny as to the student’s ability to pay it back, colleges have had free reign to raise prices at levels often double the inflation rate. 
Flush with all that money, their first spending priority often isn’t the classroom but the bureaucracy. 
From 1987 to 2012, America’s higher education system added more than half a million administrators, doubling the number of administrators relative to the number of faculty. 
To pay for these ever-increasing costs, students are borrowing
more money and taking on more and more debt. 
And with federal loans accounting for much of the $1.5 trillion
in outstanding student loan debt and more than a million people defaulting on
their loans, taxpayers are picking up much of the tab for this broken system.
So, what’s the solution?
While politicians often suggest throwing more money at the problem, that will only make things worse. 
In fact, the surest way to stop the sharp rise in both college tuition and student debt is to get the federal government out of the student loan business. 
That cuts off the open spigot of money that has allowed colleges to increase costs virtually without limit.
Restoring private lending will make the loan market more responsible and cause colleges to rein in costs, creating more affordable choices for students. 
Private lending will also limit taxpayers’ exposure to billions of dollars in loan defaults. 
One emerging private lending solution is coming from colleges themselves in the form of income share agreements. 
Such agreements allow students to obtain financing from their schools and pay it back based on a percentage of their income after graduation. 
That means their monthly loan payments are lower when their income is lower, ensuring that loan payoffs are more affordable, or that they can pay them off quicker when their income is higher. 
This system allows students to see—before they take on debt or
choose a major—what types of careers will allow them to pay off their loans
quicker and what kind of future they are investing in. 
This kind of cost savings and transparency is a win for
students, for taxpayers, and for fiscal sanity.

"In the U.S., family circumstances and schools are closely linked. This effectively limits the prospects of upward mobility for millions of children. (Photo:

What social institutions have the most immediate and strongest impact on a child’s development and well-being? According to researchers for the Pew Charitable Trust’s Economic Mobility Project, it’s the child’s family circumstances, with schools ranking as the second-most important factor.
In the U.S., family circumstances and schools are closely linked, because most cities and counties link schooling to housing. The extent to which families can select schools is largely determined by the extent to which they can afford to select their neighborhood.
This arrangement effectively limits the prospects of upward mobility for millions of children across the country. 
In 2013, the real estate brokerage firm Redfin analyzed more than 400,000 home sales. It found that, on average, families paid $50 more per square foot for houses in highly rated school districts. 
In one case, Redfin found a house priced $130,000 more than its “twin” (in terms of square footage and number of rooms) less than a mile away. The main difference? The first was in a highly rated school district; the other was not.
Although the Redfin study did not control for other potential confounding variables, its findings underscore what we all already know: Housing choice is school choice.
Many of the country’s largest school districts give families no alternative to the nearest public school. They offer no charter schools, no school vouchers–no school choice programs of any kind. 
Instead, kids are consigned to a dysfunctional school.
Fourth graders in Baltimore and Philadelphia public schools are reading more than two grade levels behind their peers nationally, according to the Nation’s Report Card. Detroit’s fourth-graders are reading nearly four grades behind their peers.
Yet parents in large public school districts often have even bigger concerns than whether Johnny can read. They’re worried more about their children’s safety. And with good reason.
From September through December last year, Chicago Public Schools dealt with more than 600 allegations of sexual violence. In the year before that, 10% of high school students in Washington, D.C., public schools were threatened or injured with a weapon on school property.
Nationwide, the National Center for Education Statistics reported more than 827,000 incidents of crime among students aged 12 to 18, including sexual assault, robbery, and theft.
Upward mobility doesn’t just require that schools keep students safe and teach them to read; it requires that schools imbue students with that cultural currency that will enable them to be productive members of a free society.
Here, too, many public schools are failing. Today, one-third of Americans–the vast majority products of our public schools–cannot name a single branch of government.
Nor is an uptick in civic literacy visible anywhere on the horizon. Instead, public schools seem more interested in introducing their pupils to leftist ideology than in teaching basic civics.
Unsurprisingly, California is leading the way in this endeavor. 
After introducing a much-derided sex education framework earlier this year (with no opt-out for families), the Golden State has now introduced an ethnic studies curriculum that brings the social justice warrior mentality of grad schools to grade schools.
Williamson Evers of the Hoover Institution calls it training for “ideological activists and proponents of identity politics.”
Inez Stepman of the Independent Women’s Forum wrote that with its references to terms like “cis-heteropatriarchy” and its broadside against capitalism, the curriculum “reads as though ripped from a Berkeley seminar on ‘critical whiteness studies.’”
All this while, as my colleague Jonathan Butcher points out, 57% of California’s black fourth-graders cannot read at even a basic level.
These disappointing outcomes support the notion that public education is actually hindering upward mobility for its students.
When government assigns children to schools that are failing every test of quality–safety, learning, and civic literacy–it is saddling those kids with lifetime opportunity costs.
Yet it need not be that way.
School choice programs allow students to attend schools that meet their learning needs. And studies show that when students avail themselves of these options, they develop better both academically and as citizens (as measured by things like political tolerance and civic engagement). Their parents are more satisfied as well.
A near-monopoly education system that denies students access to schools that would better serve them impedes upward mobility in America. It will not get better until we separate housing from schooling, through universal education choice.

“The biggest problem plaguing U.S. public schools [is]
a lack of resources.” 
So claims Robert Pianta, dean of the University of Virginia’s Curry School of Education, in an op-ed published last week in The Washington Post. In fact, Pianta asserts, government spending on K-12 education actually has declined since the 1980s. 
These claims are inaccurate, as federal government data
prove.
In fact, it is so clear that government spending on K-12 education has increased dramatically—after adjusting for inflation—that The Washington Post just issued a correction to Pianta’s article:
Correction: An earlier version of this piece stated that, adjusting for constant dollars, public funding for schools had decreased since the late 1980s. This is not the case. In fact, funding at the federal, state and local levels has increased between the 1980s and 2019.
The Post was wise to issue the correction. In real dollars, total government spending per pupil increased from $7,359 in 1980 to $9,850 by 1990, reaching $13,180 per pupil by 2015. 
Taking a longer view, real spending per student in public schools has increased from $2,763 in 1960 to more than $13,000 today.
Considerable evidence shows that government spending
has little if any relationship to academic achievement. Inflation-adjusted
spending has quadrupled since 1960, four years before President Lyndon Johnson
launched his Great Society education programs designed to wage a War on Poverty
and narrow opportunity gaps between affluent and poor children. 
As Stanford economist Eric Hanushek explains, despite this fourfold increase in government spending, student outcomes remained flat:
This productivity decline is remarkable, particularly when compared with dynamic improvements in productivity elsewhere in the U.S. economy. Schooling outcomes are the same in 2015 as they were four decades before, even though school funding is now several times as high.
Notably, as both Hanushek and Harvard’s Paul Peterson have documented, the gap in learning between students from the top 10% and bottom 10% of family income was the equivalent of four years’ worth of learning prior to the launch of the Great Society. Today, it stands unchanged—at four years’ worth of learning.
>>> Related: The Not-So-Great Society
It is possible that Pianta was basing his assertion
that school spending has declined on what he hears from teachers, who may not
feel the increases in spending. As EdChoice’s
Mike McShane and Jason Bedrick have documented,
most of that spending has been captured by the schooling bureaucracy. 
This nice chart originating from Kennesaw State University’s Ben Scafidi puts a finer point on it:
But no matter how you slice the data, contra Pianta, spending is in fact up. It is the one thing that has been tried ad nauseam. What hasn’t been tried is changing not what is spent, but who controls the dollars that are spent.
Giving families, rather than government officials, control over education funding is what will make a difference long term—a fact the data clearly support. Education choice improves academic achievement, attainment, safety, satisfaction, and a host of other important outcomes in later life.
So let’s set the record straight on education
spending, and what really matters for students across the country.

Federal “Highly
Qualified Teacher” mandates. Adequate Yearly Progress requirements. Smaller
learning communities. Improving Teacher Quality State Grants. Reading First.
Early Reading First. The dozens of other federal programs authorized via No
Child Left Behind. School Improvement Grants. Race to the Top. Common Core.
All of that has
been just since 2000. Over those past two decades, while federal policymakers
were busy enacting new federal laws, creating mandates for local school
leaders, and increasing the Department of Education’s budget from $38 billion
in 2000 (unadjusted for inflation) to roughly $70 billion today, the math and
reading performance of American high school students remained completely flat. That
is to say, stagnant. 
The U.S. is now above the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development average in reading, but alas, not because U.S.
reading performance has improved. Rather, other countries have seen declines in
reading achievement, despite increases in education spending. 
In mathematics,
however, U.S. performance has steadily declined over the past two decades.
Those are the findings from the Programme for International Student Assessment, or PISA exams, released last week. 
As The New York Times’ Dana Goldstein reported:
About a fifth of American 15-year-olds scored so low on the PISA test that it appeared they had not mastered reading skills expected of a 10-year-old, according to Andreas Schleicher, director of education and skills at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which administers the exam.
What’s more, the
achievement gap between high- and low-performing American students has widened.
The international findings mirror last month’s National Assessment of Educational Progress report, which revealed that math and reading scores across the country have continued a yearslong stagnation, with students largely showing no progress in academic achievement. 
Just
one-third of students in the fourth and eighth grades reached proficiency in
math and reading nationally on the National
Assessment of Educational Progress, which is
administered every two years.
As with the
Programme for International Student Assessment’s findings that the achievement
gap stubbornly persists for American students, the National Assessment of
Educational Progress highlighted similar findings within the U.S. 
The scores of students who are among the lowest 10% of performers
on the National Assessment of Educational Progress have dropped
significantly since 2009.
The stubborn achievement gap is not new, but the National Assessment of Educational Progress and the Programme for International Student Assessment provide additional data points on its persistence. 
As Harvard professor Paul Peterson writes in The Heritage Foundation’s new book “The Not-So-Great Society”:
The achievement gap in the United States is as wide today as it was in 1971. 
The performances on math, reading, and science tests between the most advantaged and the most disadvantaged students differ by approximately four years’ worth of learning, a disparity that has remained essentially unchanged for nearly half a century.
One of the more
recent, major pieces of federal intervention sold as a way to improve American
standing in education was the Common Core State Standards Initiative promoted
during the Obama administration. 
Common Core
national standards and test, proponents argued, would catapult American students
to the top of the math and reading pack. It was time, they argued, for the U.S.
to have the same “epiphany” Germany did in the late 1990s, and adopt
centrally planned national standards and tests.
Germany now lags
the U.S. in reading, according to the new Programme for International Student
Assessment data, and is far below Canada, a country that does not have national
standards. 
Indeed, our
neighbor to the north has performed consistently well on the
Programme for International Student
Assessment since 2000, significantly outpacing the United States, and has neither national standards,
nor a federal education department. 
Canada’s is a
decentralized education system, in which Canada’s 10 provinces set education
policy.
The fact that
Common Core didn’t catalyze improvements in the U.S. isn’t surprising. Large-scale
government programs rarely, if ever, do. 
But neither have
the myriad federal programs created since No Child Left Behind in 2001, nor
have the more than 100 federal K-12 education programs created since President Lyndon
Johnson launched his Great Society initiative in 1965 designed, ostensibly, to
narrow opportunity gaps between the poor and the affluent. 
Heritage’s
Jonathan Butcher and I detail Yuval Levin’s theory of government failure in “The Not-So-Great Society.” Levin explains that large-scale
government programs fail for three reasons:
Federal
government efforts to improve education have been dismal. Even if there were a
constitutional basis for its involvement—which there isn’t—the federal
government is simply ill-positioned to determine what education policies will
best serve the diverse local communities across our vast nation.
The sooner we can
acknowledge that improvements will not come from Washington, the sooner we’re
likely to see students flourishing in learning environments that reflect their
unique needs and desires.

"Richmond has the lowest graduation rates in Virginia. As a result, many parents have chosen to disenroll their children and seek schooling elsewhere. (Photo: Sky Noir Photography by Bill Dickinson/Getty Images)
Antione Green is working to open a second charter school in Richmond, Virginia. The school, called Richmond Urban Collective, would serve at-risk boys in grades six through eight. 
Although he is
facing steep opposition from the school board in the city, Green has mobilized
parents around Richmond who are supportive of his fight to bring more quality
education options to an area that desperately needs them. 
That fight may not be easy, however. Jason Kamras, the superintendent of Richmond Public Schools, said he’s “100% committed to ensuring that [Richmond Public Schools] remains a traditional public school system.” 
I interviewed Green, president of the Richmond Urban Collective, to learn more about his efforts to increase the charter school supply in Virginia.
Lindsey Burke: Tell me about the education options currently available to elementary, middle, and secondary students in Richmond. Do charter school options exist? 
Antione Green: Our city school system currently has
what is called an “open-enrollment process,” where families can enroll in
out-of-zone schools, based on seat availability at the desired schools. 
On the high school level, we have an academically selective process for students to apply for our magnet schools and governor schools. 
Yes, we have one
independently created charter school, Patrick Henry School of Science and Arts,
and a district-incubated charter to serve students with special needs.  
In addition, our
school system contracts with a private company to operate an alternative school
for select students.  
Burke: Is there a need for additional
education options in Richmond? What are outcomes like for students assigned to
traditional district schools in the city?
Green: We currently have no middle school
performing proficiently or meeting state accreditation standards.  
In addition, we
have the lowest-performing high schools in the state, as well as the lowest
graduation rates. As a result, many
parents have chosen to disenroll their children and seek schooling elsewhere.
Consequently, it
negatively impacts our tax base and our ability to preserve a middle class here
in our city. Our goal is to create high-quality options for parents and help
keep families here in the city.  
Burke: As you’ve begun your journey to
open a school of your own in Richmond, I’m sure you’ve had the chance to speak
with many parents about what they’re looking for in a school. 
What do you hear most often from families? What is most important to them when they engage in the school selection process?  
Green: Yes, we have met many parents on our
campaign to win school support. Many are looking for a school that can ensure
their children, post-high school, are equipped with real-world skills.  
What’s most
important to many of them is that their children have an opportunity to attend
a school that matches their learning style with a customized instructional
approach and can prepare them to be lifelong critical thinkers.   
Burke: What is unique about the model
of the Richmond Urban Collective? 
Green: What’s unique about our model is,
first, we will be the first single-gender public school in Virginia.
Secondly, we will
operate on a year-round school calendar, as well as extended school days. 
Thirdly, we will
also employ a unique instructional approach using digital resources to enhance
the academic experience. 
Lastly, recognizing
the importance of highly effective teachers to student performance, our teachers
will have access to high-quality one-on-one coaches for the purpose of
enhancing the delivery of high-quality instruction to our students. 
Burke: One day, when the school is
operational, what do you hope prospective students leave equipped with? 
Green: To ultimately contribute to reversing
the dismal performance and statistics long associated with our city high
schools. 
Beyond high
school, I want our former students to be able to contribute to the future of
our country as economically free thinkers. Period.

Before hitting the road for their
summer vacations, the justices of the Supreme Court announced last week that
they would hear a major school choice case in the next term. 
If the court rules in favor of the
families that brought this case, it could pave the way for educational freedom
and opportunity for millions of children across the country.
The case, Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue, deals with Montana’s tax credit of up to $150 per year for donations taxpayers make to a scholarship-granting organization. 
The scholarship-granting organization then provides scholarships to income-eligible children to attend a private school of their choice. 
Recipients may use the funds at qualified schools, which initially included religiously affiliated private schools. Then the Montana Department of Revenue enacted a rule excluding religious schools, citing the state constitution’s “no aid” provision (known as a Blaine Amendment) that prohibits public money from going to churches. 
Families with children at
religious schools challenged that rule, arguing that it violates their federal
constitutional right to free exercise of religion. 
Religiously affiliated schools
make up 69% of
private schools in Montana. If
this rule were to be allowed to stand, it would shut out a large percentage of
schools from the scholarship program, limiting the options of families that relied
on this assistance to send their children to the school of their choice. 
The good news is
that the Supreme Court set the stage
for the Espinoza case with its 2017 ruling in Trinity
Lutheran Church v. Comer.

In that decision, the high court
held that the state of Missouri violated the First Amendment’s Free Exercise
Clause when it
barred a church-run day care center from receiving a grant to resurface its
playground. 
The state of Missouri argued that it was trying to avoid running afoul of the Establishment Clause, which prohibits states from recognizing an official state church. In doing so, Missouri trampled on Trinity Lutheran’s free exercise rights. 
To be sure, there is some “play in the joints” between what the Establishment and Free Exercise clauses require of states.
Writing for the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts explained that by singling out the day care center for disfavored treatment and “denying a qualified religious entity a public benefit because of its religious character,” Missouri went “too far.” 
Roberts wrote in a footnote that
the decision was limited to “express discrimination based on religious identity
with respect to playground resurfacing” and stressed that the decision “do[es]
not address religious uses of funding or other forms of discrimination.” 
Justice Neil Gorsuch disagreed that the ruling was limited. 
In a concurring opinion, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, Gorsuch concluded that the “general principles” of this decision “do not permit discrimination against religious exercise—whether on the playground or anywhere else.”
Shortly after issuing this decision, the justices instructed courts in Colorado and New Mexico to square their rulings in cases dealing with a school voucher program and a textbook-lending program with the Trinity Lutheran decision. 
Thus, the scope of the Trinity
Lutheran ruling remains unclear, and now the high court has the opportunity in
the Espinoza case to make clear that states may not require religious
organizations to check their beliefs at the door before entering the secular
world. 
If allowing a church-run day care center
to compete for state grant money does not violate the Establishment Clause,
then surely there aren’t Establishment Clause concerns raised by allowing
families to use scholarship money at religious schools, for which donors
receive a modest tax credit. 
Indeed, in Zelman v.
Simmons-Harris (2002), the court
noted the “consistent distinction” it has drawn between “government programs
that provide aid directly to religious schools … and programs of true private
choice, in which government aid reaches religious schools only as a result of
the genuine and independent choices of private individuals.” 
On several occasions, the high court
has rejected Establishment Clause challenges to “neutral government programs
that provide aid directly to a broad class of individuals, who, in turn, direct
the aid to religious schools … of their own choosing.” 
The state’s Blaine Amendment also should
not provide cover for preventing families from choosing to use these
scholarship funds at religious schools. 
Source: Lindsey Burke and Jarrett Stepman, Journal of School
Choice, Blaine Amendment adoption
More than three
dozen states have Blaine Amendments, named for Sen. James G. Blaine, R-Maine,
who in the late 1800s pushed for an amendment to the U.S. Constitution
prohibiting aid to “sectarian” schools. 
As Thomas explained in the 2000 decision Mitchell v. Helms, “Consideration of the amendment arose at a time of pervasive hostility to the Catholic Church and to Catholics in general, and it was an open secret that sectarian was code for Catholic.” 
Although Blaine failed in his bid to amend the Constitution, many states—some on condition of statehood—adopted their own Blaine Amendments. 
Today, these ignoble
19th-century amendments often thwart modern-day school choice efforts as more
and more states move toward systems that enable families to direct their
child’s education funding to education options that work for them. 
With any luck, the court will use the Espinoza case to heed Thomas’ advice that “this doctrine, born of bigotry, should be buried” and pave the way for school choice across the country. 
The justices will hear oral argument in the Espinoza case during their next term, starting in October, and release a decision by the end of June 2020.

"""The federal government is the farthest it can possibly be from the students and families and individuals these [education] programs impact,"" Heritage Foundation education fellow Lindsey Burke says. Photo: Getty Images)
This week on “Problematic Women” we talk with Lindsey Burke, The Heritage Foundation’s education fellow, about a new collection of essays, “The Not-So-Great Society.” Burke, co-editor of the project, discusses what Lyndon B. Johnson’s programs really did for public education, and it’s little that is positive. She also suggests how we can begin to solve the problems the government has inflicted on the education system.  
We also break down these stories: 
And our Problematic Woman of the Week is The Heritage Foundation’s Lindsey Burke, co-editor of “The Not-So-Great Society.” Get the book here. For the interview with her, listen to the podcast or read the lightly edited transcript below. 
Lauren Evans: We are here at The Heritage Foundation’s President’s Club, where we are joined by Heritage’s education research fellow, Lindsey Burke. And she has just released a new book, “The Not-So-Great Society.” Welcome, Lindsey.  Lindsey Burke: Thank you for having me. Virginia Allen: All right, Lindsey, let’s jump right in. I want to start with the title of the book. It’s pretty unique, “The Not-So-Great Society,” and in that title you’re referring back to President Lyndon B. Johnson, who in the 1960s launched a set of domestic programs that were intended to better society. 
There was a large focus on the education system, but can you tell us a little bit more about what President Johnson’s Great Society was really intended to do and what was the effect that it had on public education? Burke: Yeah, I think that’s a really good way to frame it. What was it intended to do and what were the actual outcomes? I’m reminded of the quote that [economist] Milton Friedman said about intentions, right? He said, “One of the great mistakes is to judge policies and programs by their intentions, rather than by their results.” 
I think we have to put the Great Society, all of the programs that it initiated, in that bucket. That while there were intentions on the part of President—and we can debate what those intentions might’ve been—the outcomes have been lackluster, to put it mildly. 
The Great Society, when it kicked off in 1965, Johnson said [of] the war on poverty [that] one-third of it would be fought in the classrooms of America. And what that did was it set the stage for a federal preschool program known as Head Start that still exists today. A K-12 system of programs in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which everybody might know better, it eventually became known as No Child Left Behind. And then The Higher Education Act, which got the federal government into the game of underwriting student loans for students across the country. 
The outcomes of those programs have really been subpar, to say the least. And in the case of higher ed in particular really produced, I would argue, the exact opposite outcome of the intentions that were laid out at 1965. Evans: So when did this start going wrong? Was the program kind of a failure from the start? Are we just now seeing these negative consequences? Burke: It really was a failure from the start. Now we have about a half-century to really evaluate exactly what those failures were and how bad they were. I think one of the unique contributions of this book is to sort of take that long view and look at all of the various outcomes. But I would argue it really started from the moment that we got the federal government so intrinsically involved in education policy, which we did in ’65. If you look back to the early days of the republic, there was really no federal involvement whatsoever in education. We actually got a really small Department of Education that popped up in 1867, but it was downgraded a year later to a small little Office of Education to gather statistics. And then if you fast-forward a little bit, in 1944 we get the GI Bill. And the GI Bill, which we all know supported returning [World War II] service members who wanted to go to college. But the GI Bill was really one of the first sort of significant pieces of the federal government getting involved.
That was it. From the beginning of the republic to the GI Bill, you had very, very modest federal involvement. The national school lunch program pops up, but it’s modest. And then all of a sudden something changes. In 1957, we see the Soviets launch Sputnik. And this is of course the first earth-orbiting satellite. And then a month later, in November of ’57, they launch Sputnik II. And at that point, President Eisenhower says, “OK, we’ve got to leverage the federal government to provide some additional federal spending to support scientists and mathematicians.” 
But at that point it was really a national security prerogative. So it was appropriate for the federal government to spend some money. But what the Great Society did was it turned that on its head. And so you get Lyndon Johnson, who comes in as president in 1964, and in his first State of the Union address, he announces an all-out war on poverty in America. 
That was really the catalyst for this huge Great Society push that he eventually laid out and got signed into law, that affected everything from grade school to grad school. So we can talk a little bit about the outcomes of those programs specifically, but they have been poor to say the least when it comes to preschool. They have not moved the needle at all in terms of K-12 policy, and they have led to massive increases in college costs at the higher education level. Evans: And before these federal education programs were created, it wasn’t like this was when public education started. Just before then it was left up to the states, correct? Burke: That’s right. And localities even better. It’s a really good question because for the most part, education is a state and local issue. And even in the wake of all of the federal intervention that Johnson catalyzed, today the federal government is still just an 8.5% stakeholder on all K-12 education spending. 
So education is a quintessentially state and local issue. It’s about a 45/45 split if we want to get really technical in the revenue at the state and local level. But it is something that is supposed to be locally driven. It’s supposed to be close to families. Programs and education are supposed to be situated closest to the people that they impact. Which is why it was so ill advised from the very beginning, to get to your earlier point about having the federal government enter that domain. The federal government is the farthest it can possibly be from the students and families and individuals these programs impact. Allen: So let’s wait a minute to talk about the effect that it’s had on colleges. Let’s start with elementary and high school. What did we have before that was so good? And then what have we lost within elementary and high school with the implementation of the Great Society? Burke: That’s a great question. At the K-12 level, the elementary and high school level, we have seen completely flat academic outcomes since the program began in ’65. We have a chapter in our book, “The Not-So-Great Society,” by Harvard’s Paul Peterson. And he talks about how in 1965 students who are low income and students who were upper income, from upper-income families, there was a four-grade-level difference in learning between those students. 
Today, that difference is four grade levels worth of learning. We have not moved the needle whatsoever in terms of narrowing that achievement gap between poor children and their more affluent peers. We have not moved the needle in terms of graduation rates for disadvantaged children. We are still in the middle of the pack internationally. We’re not competitive internationally when we look at other countries around the world, and so the needle has essentially been flat. 
If you look at metrics, take for instance reading achievement among high school seniors. Reading achievement is the same today as it was when those Great Society programs passed. So on every metric that you can look at, we have not seen the needle move whatsoever in elementary and secondary education. And I should add, we have seen per-pupil federal education dollars quadruple in real terms since the Great Society launched. So a fourfold inflation-adjusted increase in spending, and we have bought with that a 137% increase in nonteaching staff. 
So that’s basically what we got. We got no improvement in terms of academic outcomes, but we got a public education system that saw significant nonteaching, administrative bloat in the wake of the Great Society. Evans: And Lindsey, I know you’re not an economist, but where does that money come from? Burke: I am not an economist, but I can tell you that it comes from you and me. I mean, it is taxpayer-supported, and that’s a really interesting segue I think into the higher ed component and the impact of the Great Society. Prior to the Great Society initiative in ’65, most students paid their way to go to college and college was relatively affordable. 
What we got, though, when we had massive federal subsidization after the Great Society launched, this was the Higher Education Act. It got signed into law in ’65, and for the first time it puts the full faith and credit of Uncle Sam behind private student loans. A massive increase in federal subsidies for higher ed. So what that did was that laid the groundwork for where we are today, which is a federal government that originates and services and directly provides 90% of all student loans across the country. What that means: Not only has it made college less affordable, but to quote Richard Vedder, who is an economist at the University of Ohio who also has a chapter in our book: “Basically, the federal government has been dumping money out of airplanes onto universities.”
And so of course that enables them to spend profligately. To create climbing walls and lazy rivers and tiger grottoes, to not be remotely fiscally responsible with their money because they know that they can pass that tab onto students, who get easy access to federal student loans with virtually no credit check. Then if they default or if there’s loan forgiveness, because the federal government subsidizes 90% of all student loans, that bill is paid by taxpayers when students default. 
And so we’re in a really tenuous situation in higher education financing. We have $1.6 trillion in outstanding student loan debt today in America. That is breathtaking. It’s not going away anytime soon, and the policies that exist today because of the Great Society programs are what have led to that situation being the case. Allen: So we really saw the exact opposite effect … Burke: Yes. Allen: … of what it was supposed to do, right?Burke: Exactly. Evans: Interesting. Exactly. And I should say on that too, the whole Great Society initiative, a big part is the War on Poverty? Burke: It was to ostensibly help lower-income individuals climb the ladder of economic mobility. It failed in the K-12 realm, as we talked about. And in higher education, Richard Vedder in our book talks about a slightly lower proportion of low-income students today attend college than they did in 1965. So it’s failed on every measure to try to improve outcomes for low-income Americans. Allen: So where would you begin to try to fix this? It’s such a massive issue, and maybe it’s two very separate answers [on] what would fix elementary and high school versus college. What would you say to that? Burke: I think that overarching answer is the same, and we say this in our book. The first step is a bold one and it is to get the federal government out of these programs, from preschool through grad school. 
That it is a sort of [a] technical fix in a way, because the federal government is intrinsically involved in all education policy today. That includes having programs over at the Department of Health and Human Services. This is where Head Start is located. Of course, the federal Department of Education. There are programs over at DOD [the Department of Defense]. 
Education programs are everywhere in the federal government, but what we should start thinking about is how we wind down the Department of Education as a Cabinet-level agency. And for those programs that are constitutional, are performing well, where do we house those programs? Do we think about maybe Treasury can manage student loans, for instance? Do we think about putting some of these statistic reviews that the federal government currently does with the Department of Ed over at the Census Bureau? There are ways to think about how we technically wind down the department as a Cabinet-level agency. 
Remember the Department of Education has only been around since 1980, right? It hasn’t been around forever. What that does is you sort of rebalance power over education and you start to pull that power back down to the state and local level and ultimately family level, where it belongs. Because at the end of the day, the heart of the problem with the Great Society is that it created this fundamental misalignment of power and incentives. 
It really shifted the locus of power of control to the federal government and out of the hands of localities and states and ultimately families. And so winding down federal intervention means putting it back in the hands of state [and] local leaders and ultimately parents. Evans: I’m glad you said that, Lindsey, because that gets into my next question. With that vacuum, as government takes up more space and leaves less space for parents to be involved … Burke: That’s right. Evans: How does that actually affect an individual student? Burke: That’s a great question and this is one of the thrusts of our book is to say, “You know, we’ve had half a century to look at the Great Society and see that it has been the Not-So-Great Society and has failed, and we need to basically rebalance to states, localities, and families and civil society at the end of the day. 
When you empower civil society, that means local community options, not federal government options, you ultimately empower families because they have access to options that are situated closest to them. So it means making space for things like education choice programs to flourish at the state and local level. At the higher education level, it means getting Uncle Sam out of the student loan business so that private providers can enter the market again. We used to have a thriving private student loan market. But even better, it allows innovative options like income share agreements, for instance, to bubble up from the surface. 
If you look at a place like Purdue University, there are really great examples. Purdue is offering income share agreements to some of its students and basically that enables the student to pay nothing upfront for college. And Purdue, as a result of offsetting that cost upfront, knows exactly how much that student is likely to earn if they enter engineering versus another field. They can set their interest rates accordingly. And then once the student has a job, Purdue receives a portion of their income on the back end.
These are innovative options that are not debt-based in the way that we’ve traditionally thought about them, and they certainly get taxpayers off the hook for financing student loans. So, we move the federal government out and we make space for civil society options like that to reemerge. Allen: I’m glad that you brought that up because one of the awesome women that we’ve celebrated on this podcast is Virginia Walden Ford. And you know her and she played such a critical role in D.C. in providing a program where students could take that little bit of money and actually apply it to going to a private school or a charter school. Are we seeing more and more of those programs emerge? Burke: You know, it’s so interesting because if we think about the Great Society, it was 1965. A few years prior to that, in 1955, we had something else come out and that was the essay written by Milton Friedman for the first time in which he formalized the idea basically of a school voucher. And it was in that 1955 essay that he said, “Let’s separate the financing of education from the delivery of services.” And so I like to think about the fact that we basically had two competing ideas moving forward, sort of in tandem, right? Milton Friedman’s idea of freedom and education, and then the top-down, heavy-handed, Great Society failure that we’ve seen. But ultimately Milton Friedman’s idea is winning out and honestly, it had remained an academic idea until about 1990. 
We didn’t see a lot of school choice before 1990. But then all of a sudden we get the first program [in] Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in ’91. We get a school voucher program. Then throughout the ’90s we see a couple of other programs. Today, we have 63 private school choice programs in 29 states and in D.C. And Virginia Walden Ford is really … we call her the mother of the D.C. voucher program. It was because of her that that program began in Washington, D.C., in 2003, and it is not hyperbolic to say that it has saved the lives—and Virginia herself saved the lives—of thousands of D.C. children as a result. They have been able to escape failing and unsafe and unsatisfactory public schools in Washington, D.C., and attend a private school of choice where they’re safe and they’re learning and their parents are happy and they’re satisfied. 
That is all because they’re able to select a school where the learning options reflect their values and their hopes and their aspirations for their lives long term. That’s sort of the student-level story of it. And when we look at the data … we’re here at President’s Club, we heard yesterday from Dr. Patrick Wolf, who’s at the University of Arkansas, he walked us through the research. When we look at the research, it is overwhelmingly positive on the benefits of school choice. … 
There are 16 randomized, controlled trial evaluations that look at the impact of school choice on academic achievement, and 10 of those find statistically significant improvements for students. We have four that have no effects, so no difference between public and private school choice options. And then two that have negative effects. But those two were both from Louisiana, which is a uniquely heavily regulated state. I say all that to say the impact of school choice, the literature shows it is positive on balance, that kids are performing phenomenally as a result. That’s all because we’re putting power in the hands of parents and quite frankly, putting some much-needed competitive pressure on the public school systems to improve and to be responsive to families. Evans: So, Lindsey, a lot of our listeners are probably not quite parent age, but what is someone who’s, you know, 18, 19, 20, 25, what should they be thinking about school choice? Burke: I’m not being that much older now, but I think all the time about how our education system, just the way it operates is anathema to every other aspect of American life. Everything we do every day. 
Like before we started this podcast a few minutes ago, somebody said, “Should I pull up the Starbucks app to put in my order?” Right? We expect customization with everything. I got here in an Uber this morning that picked me up from my house and brought me here where I needed to be in very quick order. 
We do everything on demand from what we watch on TV to what we order, right? We have Uber Eats. We have scooters. We have Lime, you know? Everything is just totally, totally customized, except for our education system. We assign students based on their parents’ ZIP code, which means low-income families are the ones who have the least power in that system. We assign students based on their ZIP codes, to whatever government-run school happens to be closest to where their parents can afford to live. 
What else do we do that operates that way? The post office, maybe. The DMV. That’s about it. So we have this system in education that looks more like a monopoly than a market. Much more like a monopoly than any sort of customized option everybody under 25 would demand in any other sector. I think eventually, honestly, it’s going to work itself out. Because I think the under-25 crowd is so used to that customization, that once they get to the point where they are having kids of their own and have to navigate that school system, they will be completely dumbfounded by the fact that they cannot customize it the way they customize everything else.

Across the country, math and reading scores have continued a yearslong stagnation, with students largely showing no progress in academic achievement. 
That’s one major takeaway from the 2019 National Assessment
of Educational Progress, released earlier this week by the National Assessment
Governing Board.
Often referred to as the Nation’s Report Card, the assessment tracks the progress of students in the fourth and eighth grade on reading and mathematics achievement, releasing those findings every other year.
The 2019 results were, overall, dismal. 
Just one-third of students in the fourth and eighth grade reached proficiency in math and reading nationally.
Harvard professor Paul Peterson writes that “in the first decade of the 21st century, white, black, and Hispanic student performance was on the rise, but in the second [decade], those gains have ground to a halt, with even hints of decline in reading.”
For students who are among the lowest 10% of performers on the National Assessment of Educational Progress, their scores have dropped significantly since 2009, as Brown University professor Susanna Loeb points out.
The Urban Institute’s Matthew Chingos notes that, although the national assessment scores rarely fluctuate more than one or two points, eighth-grade reading scores declined four full points this time.
Ten points on the national assessment is the equivalent of roughly one grade level worth of learning. That means, as Chingos observes, that eighth-graders are reading at a level “comparable to their counterparts of 10-20 years ago.”
Borrowing
from Shakespeare, education researcher
Matthew Ladner
calls the scores for students with special needs an Agincourt-level disaster. 
With a few exceptions—including in school choice leader Arizona—eighth-grade math scores for children with special needs saw major declines, as this chart from Ladner shows:
Notably, most of the states that saw gains in this area—Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Tennessee—have education choice options, specifically for children with special needs.
So,
what’s to be made of this great stagnation?
Taxpayers
have spent some $2 trillion on K-12 education programs at the federal level,
with a specific goal of narrowing achievement gaps between children from
low-income families and their more affluent peers. 
These policies, launched as part of President Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society push, have failed to move the needle on improved education options for students, as these newest scores further demonstrate. 
Peterson writes in The Heritage Foundation’s new book “The Not-So-Great Society”:
The achievement gap in the United States is as wide today as it was in 1971. The performances on math, reading, and science tests between the most advantaged and the most disadvantaged students differ by approximately four years’ worth of learning, a disparity that has remained essentially unchanged for nearly half a century.
Federal per-pupil K-12 education spending has quadrupled in real
terms since the 1960s. The policies and programs launched by the Johnson administration as
part of the War on Poverty have not helped students, and neither have more
recent federal policies promulgated by officials in Washington. 
As my colleague Jonathan Butcher and I write in “The Not-So-Great Society”:
What is to be done? In education, the first step to improving the quality of pre-K, K-12, and postsecondary learning options is a bold one: eliminating Washington’s involvement. 
Education in the U.S. should return to its roots from the earliest days of the republic, when parents had a central role in choosing how and where their child learns … 
From
the Great Society to No Child Left Behind to the Common Core national standards
advanced under the Obama administration,
Washington’s intervention in education has been a failure for students and
taxpayers alike. 
It’s time to try a different approach.

“Dismal.” “A train wreck.” That’s how people have characterized the results of this year’s National Assessment of Educational Progress.
The NAEP assesses fourth and eighth-graders’ performance in reading and math every other year. Test results had been trending upward since the early 1990s, but the results released last month indicated a drop in both math and reading among middle-schoolers nationally. Nevada students didn’t fare any better.
The state’s students have consistently performed well below the national average. Among the 50 states, Nevada fourth-graders now rank 45th in math and 44th in reading. Eighth-graders rank 42nd and 43rd, respectively.
Equally troubling is the lack of improvement among minority and low-income students in Nevada. Nationwide, the achievement gap between students who are eligible for free or reduced-price lunch and those who aren’t eligible has been narrowing. In Nevada, the gap has remained unchanged since 2000.
But this year, legislators gave Nevadans hope that they could turn the table on lackluster academic improvement: They passed the nation’s first near-universal Education Savings Account program. Now every child who has attended a public school in the state for at least 100 days can get access to an account that amounts to 90 percent of what the state would have spent on the child in his previous school, or about $5,100. And children from low-income families or with special needs will have access to accounts worth 100 percent of that amount—roughly $5,700.
This money can be used for tuition at a private school of choice, or it can be used to completely customize a child’s education. ESA funds can pay for private tutors, online learning options, special education therapies and services, textbooks, curricula, and Advanced Placement tests, among a variety of other education-related services and products. The customization opportunities are endless and represent a watershed moment for education in Nevada.
The new ESA option will empower families to access quality education options—particularly low-income families who have had very few choices in the past. Yet, in a state that ranks near the bottom in reading and math, the American Civil Liberties Union has filed a lawsuit to stop this promising innovation in its tracks.
The lawsuit relies in part on a 19th-century relic known as the “Blaine Amendment”—originally established to blunt the growth of Catholic schooling. The amendment’s roots are well-documented as being anti-Catholic and anti-immigrant. Indeed, as the U.S. Supreme Court acknowledged in Mitchell v. Helms, the effort had “a shameful pedigree. … Consideration of the amendment arose at a time of pervasive hostility to the Catholic Church and to Catholics in general.”
The ACLU is on the wrong side of history in using Blaine to thwart this modern-day education choice option.
Nevada’s Blaine Amendment reads: “no public funds of any kind or character whatever, State, county or Municipal, shall be used for sectarian purpose.” But, as the Institute for Justice notes, the language does not apply to “publicly funded educational assistance programs like Nevada’s ESA Program” and “does not constrain the private choices of private individuals.”
Foes of ESAs have lodged a second objection as well: that the accounts violate the state’s obligation to pay for a uniform system of public schools. Yet the ESA option does no such thing. Instead, as the Institute for Justice observes, just like charter and magnet schools, ESAs simply provide for additional education options on top of the existing public school system.
As the new NAEP numbers demonstrate, Nevada has a lot of room for improvement. ESAs may hold the key to jump-starting long-overdue reform and will have the immediate effect of enabling any family with a child in a public school who chooses to use an ESA to craft a tailor-made education for that child. That is, as long as proponents of the status quo, relying on 19th-century ignoble amendments, can stay out of the way.

"The Supreme Court heard oral arguments on Wednesday in a religious liberty case between a Lutheran church and the state of Missouri. (Photo: iStock Photos)
On Wednesday morning, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Trinity Lutheran Church’s case against the state of Missouri—a case involving discrimination by the state in giving out publicly funded grants.
Missouri has a grant program to offset the cost of resurfacing playgrounds with rubber surfaces made from recycled tires. This helps the state reduce the number of tires in its landfills and make playgrounds safer for kids.
Trinity Lutheran Church applied for a grant to resurface its preschool playground. Though its application met all the neutral criteria and was rated highly, Missouri denied that application solely because it came from a church.
The state claims that its constitution required it to reject the church’s request because of a “no aid” provision that prevents public money from going to churches. More than three dozen states have similar laws (known as Blaine Amendments), which were enacted during the 19th century to single out Catholic immigrants for disfavored treatment.
Trinity Lutheran Church argues that using state funds to ensure its playground is safe for kids is a completely secular purpose and the state’s actions demonstrate a hostility to religion.
Courtroom Arguments
At the argument, lawyers for both sides faced a very active bench. The justices were talking over each other, trying to get in as many questions as they could in the allotted argument time.
It’s no wonder—the justices had a lot of time to think about this case, since they granted review in January 2016 and appeared to hold off in hearing the case until a ninth justice was confirmed.
Right off the bat, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg asked David Cortman, an attorney from Alliance Defending Freedom representing Trinity Lutheran, why a 1947 case saying states don’t have to fund the building of churches doesn’t dispose of this case.
Cortman answered that the court also said states cannot deprive churches of government benefits, and that’s just what Missouri did here. He explained that the justices should look at where the money would be going—to a secular activity.
When Justice Elena Kagan analogized this to a program to put computers in religious schools, Cortman said that this case is easier to decide because unlike computers, a playground doesn’t enable any religious activity.
Justice Sonia Sotomayor brought up the court’s recognition of space between the Establishment and the Free Exercise Clauses that allows states some “play in the joints.” She mentioned that Blaine Amendments—which she called an “admirable tradition” in our nation—prohibit public funds from going to churches.
Justice Samuel Alito asked Cortman if he agreed with Sotomayor that Blaine Amendments reflect an admirable tradition. Cortman emphatically said no, highlighting the anti-Catholic bigotry that animated the passage of many of these laws.
Kagan then asked if Missouri’s action falls within this space between the two clauses.
Cortman explained that while states have tremendous leeway in how they set up programs such as this (e.g. only for public schools), Missouri was clearly singling out churches for disfavored treatment—something the “play in the joints” does not allow.
Some of the justices were clearly concerned about how far states could take these “no aid” provisions. Justice Stephen Breyer repeatedly pressed the lawyer representing Missouri, James Layton, on whether states could decline to offer police and fire protection to churches.
Layton explained that since those benefits are offered to everyone, there wouldn’t be a concern about the state getting entangled in the business of a church or being seen as endorsing a church (both aspects of the Supreme Court’s convoluted Establishment Clause jurisprudence).
In selective programs, such as the recycled tire grant program, Layton maintained that the state could make the decision to exclude churches in order to sidestep any Establishment Clause concerns.
Breyer asked about crossing guards, since they aren’t placed everywhere, and Layton simply said this case is different because it involves physical improvement to the church’s property.
Alito asked whether the state could disqualify religious students from a scholarship program based on academic credentials after the fact if too many religious students were earning the scholarship. Layton admitted that would pose an equal protection problem.
Chief Justice John Roberts asked if the state could offer tours of its capitol building to student groups, but exclude groups from religious schools. Layton replied that this would be another example of a universal benefit, so the state’s concerns about entanglement with a church would not be valid.
Justice Neil Gorsuch came back to this universal/selective distinction later, asking why discrimination based on religious status is permissible in a selective program, but not in a universal program.
Layton fell back on the claim that since this involved a physical improvement to Trinity Lutheran’s property, it’s on the wrong side of the line and looks like state endorsement of religion.
Kagan pointed out that the state’s entanglement and endorsement concerns would need to rise to a high level in order to burden the constitutional rights of its citizens, as it did with Trinity Lutheran.
In his brief rebuttal, Cortman pointed out that there is no endorsement problem here because the state set out neutral, secular criteria for its grant program—criteria that Trinity Lutheran met.
He also took issue with the state’s characterization that giving a one-time grant to the church would constitute entanglement. He explained that entanglement requires the state’s ongoing, intrusive involvement with a church—something that simply would not occur if Trinity Lutheran received this grant.
An issue lingering in the background was the Missouri governor’s eleventh hour decision to announce on Facebook that going forward, he will not exclude churches from this grant program.
This would not, however, change the outcome for Trinity Lutheran. The church could apply for the grant a second time, but there are no guarantees that the governor won’t change his mind in the future.
So, that’s not enough for the Supreme Court to choose not to decide this case.
Next Steps
Now, the justices will deliberate and issue an opinion by the end of the court’s term in June.
Based on the questions at argument today, a number of the justices appeared to be concerned about the state’s lack of a limiting principle on excluding religiously affiliated groups from state grant programs.
If Trinity Lutheran wins the day, it will be a signal to states that they may not discriminate against churches under the guise of Blaine Amendments.

In a big win for religious liberty, the Supreme Court ruled on Monday in favor of Trinity Lutheran Church’s case against the state of Missouri. The case involved discrimination by the state in giving out publicly funded grants.
In an opinion by Chief Justice John Roberts, seven members of the court agreed that Missouri had violated the Constitution’s Free Exercise Clause.
Missouri has a grant program to offset the cost of resurfacing playgrounds with rubber surfaces made from recycled tires. This helps the state reduce the number of tires in its landfills and make playgrounds safer for kids.
Trinity Lutheran Church applied for such a grant to resurface its preschool playground. Though its application met all the neutral criteria and was rated highly, Missouri denied that application solely because it came from a church.
The state claimed that its constitution required it to reject the church’s request because of a “no aid” provision that prevents public money from going to churches.
The state also claimed it was trying to avoid violating the Establishment Clause, which today prohibits states from recognizing an official state church.
Trinity Lutheran Church argued that using state funds to ensure its playground is safe for kids is a completely secular purpose and the state’s actions demonstrate a hostility toward religion.
In its ruling, the court recognized that churches do not have to give up their religious identity in order to compete with secular organizations for state funds.
Missouri had excluded Trinity Lutheran from its grant program, and the court has repeatedly ruled against laws that require people to “choose between their religious beliefs and receiving a government benefit.”
The state singled out Trinity Lutheran for disfavored treatment because of its religious identity, so the court applied the “most exacting scrutiny” to find the state violated Trinity Lutheran’s free exercise.
Evaluating the state’s Establishment Clause concerns, the court wrote, “In the face of clear infringement on free exercise … that interest cannot qualify as compelling.”
While there is some “play in the joints” between the two religion clauses, “denying a qualified religious entity a public benefit because of its religious character … goes too far.”
Justice Neil Gorsuch concurred, explaining that the decision should not be read narrowly to apply only to cases involving playgrounds or children’s health and safety. Indeed, he concluded, “the general principles here do not permit discrimination against religious exercise—whether on the playground or anywhere else.”
>>> Stay up to date with the latest at the Supreme Court by checking out SCOTUS 101, a new podcast hosted by Heritage Foundation scholars Elizabeth Slattery and Tiffany Bates.
Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a dissenting opinion, which Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined, arguing that today’s decision weakens the separation of church and state.
In their view, allowing a church to apply for a grant like Missouri’s scrap tires program violates the Establishment Clause because “[w]hen a government funds a house of worship, it underwrites this religious exercise.”
Sotomayor expressed her concern that this decision makes the “separation of church and state … a constitutional slogan, not a constitutional commitment.”
But in fact, that famous phrase is not part of the Constitution, and certainly would not allow states to “impose special disabilities on the basis of … religious status.”
The so-called “wall of separation” comes from President Thomas Jefferson’s letter to the Danbury Baptist Association, but it’s worth pointing out that Jefferson approved of using federal funds to build churches.
This dissent highlights the fact that some people (and at least two justices) believe religious believers need to stay out of the public square and effectively check their beliefs at the door before entering the secular world.
Thankfully, the Constitution protects the freedom to believe what you want and live out those beliefs, and on Monday, religious freedom prevailed at the Supreme Court.

"A Maryland school has been banned from a state voucher program due to its faith-based views on gay marriage and transgenderism. (Photo: Lane Turner/The Boston Globe/Getty Images)

Nicole Russell is a contributor to The Daily Signal. Her work has appeared in The Atlantic, The New York Times, National Review, Politico, The Washington Times, The American Spectator, and Parents Magazine.
Officials in the state of Maryland have banned a school from their voucher program due to its faith-based views on gay marriage and transgenderism. The Baltimore Sun reported that Bethel Christian Academy responded to the ban with a lawsuit contending officials violated its religious freedom.
The case will now be heard in federal court
According to the complaint filed in June, the voucher program in Maryland—Broadening Options and Opportunities for Students—launched in the 2016-2017 school year and benefits low-income students, allowing them to attend private schools they otherwise may be unable to afford. 
The state instituted a ban on Bethel Christian
Academy after sifting through the handbooks of nearly 180 schools that
participated in the voucher program. Of those, nearly 20 were deemed ineligible
due to discriminatory language in their handbooks, including Bethel. 
Though Bethel Christian Academy espouses traditional Christian beliefs about marriage and sexuality, the school has not disqualified a student from attending based on sexual orientation. Officials required the school to reimburse the state for its participation in the program prior to the ban, which it did.  
In 2018,
Matthew Gallagher, chairman of an advisory board that oversees the vouchers,
wrote the school saying the state viewed its policy as discriminatory. 
The
lawsuit says Gallagher wrote, “A non-heterosexual student may reasonably view
the policy as one that allows denial of admission or discipline or expulsion on
the basis of his or her sexual orientation. Therefore, the Board concluded that
this policy, on its face, was in conflict with the nondiscrimination clause
contained in the … law.”
The Christian school opposed the state’s ban and said Maryland’s decision infringed on its First Amendment right to religious freedom. 
“The Supreme Court has been very clear that there is no place in our society for religious hostility,” said Christiana Holcomb, the school’s legal counsel, according to The Baltimore Sun. “That is the crux of the issue of this case.” 
Holcomb said that Bethel is no longer able to participate in the voucher program because of Bethel’s Judeo-Christian beliefs about marriage. 
The intersection of religious freedom and civil rights is the latest sticky set of legal issues the nation is contending with as LGBT causes are increasingly being litigated at all levels of the judiciary. However unusual this particular case might seem—it certainly hasn’t made a big splash in the news—the Supreme Court agreed to hear oral arguments for a similar case, Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue, on Jan. 22.   
In that case, low-income children in Montana are no longer able to participate in a scholarship program if they choose to “spend” their voucher attending a religious school.
Even though Montana’s state legislature passed the Tax Credit Scholarship Program in 2015—which would have allowed Montana citizens a modest credit of $150 to a private scholarship program—the Montana Department of Revenue refused to implement the program. 
Its reason? The Blaine Amendment, something at least some legal scholars believe is a 19th-century law, steeped in bigotry, and which also happens to ban tax credits going to schools with a religious affiliation. 
In its amicus brief filed on behalf of the case, the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a nonprofit, argued that the Blaine Amendment violated the First Amendment rights of the citizens of Montana. It makes a persuasive case that all Blaine Amendments are anti-Catholic, and thus unconstitutional under the Free Exercise Clause of the Constitution.
It’s clear this is a government-led campaign
against faith-based schools, and an even more discreet campaign against school
choice. 
School choice is a valuable aspect of our
education system. 
Research shows that for many students, when they’re able to exercise choice, their outcomes improve and society as a whole benefits. As such, states with school choice programs should not be able to exclude religious schools from participating—it’s a violation of students’ rights. 
The concept that schools can only participate
in the state voucher program only if they are completely secular is also a
bogus claim: A state is not establishing a religion just because it’s aiding
students in their ability to attend a school with religious beliefs. 
While it’s not clear how the Supreme Court will decide on Espinoza or what the implications of a ruling may be, it is clear that states should refrain from this targeted attack on religious schools, under the guise of ensuring discrimination is nonexistent. 
Espousing religious beliefs is not a form of
discrimination nor is the state’s creation of school choice programs an attempt
to establish a religion.

Abigail Klose is a graduate of the Young Leaders Program at The Heritage Foundation.
The Supreme
Court returned Monday for oral arguments after a lengthy holiday break. During
the court’s January sitting, the justices will hear arguments in eight cases,
including ones dealing with school choice and the “Bridgegate” scandal. 
The
justices already have heard arguments in cases involving the Second Amendment,
Obamacare, and whether federal law covers claims of discrimination based on
gender identity and sexual orientation. 
Later in
the term, the court will take up cases involving the president’s ability to
fire the head of an “independent” agency, regulation of abortion providers, and
the dispute over a subpoena for President Donald Trump’s financial records. 
Here are
two key cases coming up in January. 
The first
case, Kelly v. United States, is set for oral argument Tuesday. 
In September 2013, the George Washington Bridge—called the busiest bridge in the world, connecting Fort Lee, New Jersey, and Manhattan—faced major traffic delays. 
In a scandal
later known as “Bridgegate,” a four-day traffic jam turned out to be a plan
concocted by aides to then-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to punish Fort Lee’s
mayor for refusing to endorse Christie’s reelection bid. 
Pursuant to
a deal struck by the state and city decades ago, the Port Authority of New York
and New Jersey designated three of the 12 inbound lanes as “special access lanes”
for traffic coming from Fort Lee into Manhattan during the morning rush hour. 
Beginning Sept. 9, 2013, the first day of the new school year, Port Authority police reduced the special access lanes to one. The resulting traffic jam created gridlock throughout Fort Lee for the next three days. Pleas from the mayor to the Port Authority went unanswered. 
During a subsequent investigation into Bridgegate, the governor’s aides claimed the lane changes were part of a traffic study. But an email from deputy chief of staff Bridget Anne Kelly made the plan clear: It was “[t]ime for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.” 
Kelly and Bill Baroni, deputy executive director of the Port Authority, were both fired and later convicted of seven federal crimes.  
On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit affirmed their convictions for wire fraud and defrauding a federally funded program, finding that Kelly and Baroni deprived the Port Authority of its property by concealing their real reason (political retribution) for an otherwise permissible act. 
The issue
before the Supreme Court is whether Kelly and Baroni defrauded the government
of property by claiming a public policy reason supported an official decision
when that was not the real reason for the decision. 
They admit
their actions were “petty, insensitive, and ill-advised,” but argue that “political abuses of power are addressed politically.” They contend that hiding
the political motives for an otherwise permissible act did not deprive the Port
Authority of its property. 
Kelly and Baroni encourage the Supreme Court not to criminalize political “spin” and instead follow the line of past cases in which the justices have “rebuffed efforts to use criminal fraud laws to police the ethical duty of public officials.” 
In 2015, the Montana Legislature created a tax credit scholarship program that would provide scholarships for income-eligible students to use at qualified private schools. 
Initially, recipients could use scholarship funds at qualified religiously affiliated schools. However, the Montana Department of Revenue implemented an administrative rule excluding religious schools, citing a provision in the state constitution that bars state funds from aiding religious organizations. 
Parents who
relied on the scholarship funds to send their kids to religious schools filed a
lawsuit in state court challenging the administrative rule. They argued that
the rule violates the Religion Clauses of the U.S. Constitution as well as the 14th
Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause. 
The parents
maintain that the tax credit program did not violate the state constitution’s
“no aid” provision since the tax credit merely incentivized private donations.
The district court ruled in favor of the parents, but the Montana Supreme Court
reversed and invalidated the scholarship program in its entirety. 
Now the
parents have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to extend the logic of Trinity Lutheran Church v. Comer, a 2017 ruling, to the school
choice area.
In Trinity Lutheran, the Supreme Court ruled that Missouri violated the Free Exercise Clause when it barred a church-run day care center from receiving a public grant to resurface its playground. The justices reasoned that Missouri had improperly singled out the day care center for unfavorable treatment and denied it a public benefit solely because of its religious affiliation. 
The parents
also point out that the Supreme Court has drawn a distinction between
government directly providing aid to religious schools and providing aid to
individuals who then have the choice to use those funds at religious schools. 
Montana, on
the other hand, points to Locke v. Davey (2004), in which
the Supreme Court held that, consistent with the Establishment Clause, states
could prohibit the use of public scholarship funds for college students
studying to become ministers. 
The Montana case offers the Supreme Court the chance to harmonize these two prior rulings and provide guidance to the many states that have tax credit scholarships.

"A 40-foot cross  honoring 49 fallen World War I soldiers from Prince George’s County stands at the busy intersection of Bladensburg and Annapolis roads and Baltimore Avenue in this photo taken Feb. 28 in Bladensburg, Maryland.  (Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)
The Supreme Court ruled 7-2 Thursday that a cross-shaped war memorial on public land in Maryland doesn’t violate the Constitution. 
In the case of American Legion v. the American Humanist Association, the atheist group had sued seeking removal of the 40-foot Peace Cross in Prince George’s County—just outside Washington, D.C.—contending that the World War I memorial was contrary to the separation of church and state.
However, a supermajority on a court that is often closely divided on hot-button issues determined the history of the Peace Cross erected in Bladensburg, Maryland, doesn’t indicate it promoted a religion, Christianity, in honoring 49 local men who died in the war.
“For nearly a century, the Bladensburg Cross has expressed the community’s grief at the loss of the young men who perished, its thanks for their sacrifice, and its dedication to the ideals for which they fought,” Justice Samuel Alito wrote in the majority opinion for the court. 
Alito went on to quote Justice Stephen Breyer’s words from a previous case also hinging on the Constitution’s Establishment Clause.                
“It has become a prominent community landmark, and its removal or radical alteration at this date would be seen by many not as a neutral act but as the manifestation of ‘a hostility toward religion that has no place in our Establishment Clause traditions,’” Alito wrote.         
Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Elena Kagan, Brett Kavanaugh, Clarence Thomas, and Neil Gorsuch joined Alito and Breyer in the majority. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor dissented.
The Trump administration’s Justice Department supported keeping the Bladensburg Peace Cross, a local landmark situated in a traffic circle.
The high court in its ruling shot down a 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that determined the memorial was unconstitutional, siding with plaintiffs who argued it violated the separation of church and state. 
The cross-shaped monument, constructed between 1919 and 1925, stands on property owned by the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, a government agency created by the state of Maryland. 
The American Humanist Association, representing some Prince George’s County residents, sued in 2014 to force removal of the memorial, naming both the Park and Planning Commission and the American Legion, which originally helped pay for it.

 “This is a landmark victory for religious freedom.  The days of illegitimately weaponizing the Establishment Clause and attacking religious symbols in public are over,” Kelly Shackelford, president of First Liberty, a law firm defending religious freedom that litigated the case, said in a formal statement on the ruling. 
“Our founders would have been appalled at this attempt to make the government hostile to our religious heritage, history, and symbols,” Shackelford said. 
The American Humanist Association said it would move to limit the scope of the ruling. 
“In the face of today’s decision, we must all pursue new avenues to bolster the First Amendment,” Executive Director Roy Speckhardt said in a prepared statement. “Our legislative efforts will be redoubled as the American Humanist Association works to strengthen the wall of separation between church and state, brick by brick. And in the interim, our legal team will do what it can to narrow the breadth of this decision in courtrooms across the country.” 
The high court ruling marked a win for all Americans, said Emilie Kao, director of the DeVos Center for Religion and Civil Society at The Heritage Foundation. 
“The founders envisioned a public square where Americans of all faiths, and even those with no faith, would be free to express their beliefs,” Kao said in a written statement. 
“Throughout our history, Americans have used religious symbols to commemorate meaningful events—from legislative prayer to observing holidays and expressing the principles of justice,” she said.
But, Kao added, the Supreme Court could have done more. 
“While the court decided this case correctly, it did not clarify its own confusing and contradictory standards for deciding other Establishment Clause cases. Even though four justices criticized the long-discredited 1971 decision in Lemon v. Kurtzman and its ‘shortcomings,’ they did not vote to overturn this distortion of the Constitution,” Kao said.
“The Constitution as written, not the personal views of judges, should guide how the American people express their religious faith in the public square.”

One of the most
profound differences between the American and French views of religious freedom
is our treatment of religious symbols in the public square. 
America’s Founders
envisioned a public square that is neither secular nor sacred. In contrast, France
has enacted policies that advance radical secularism. 
French law has erased
religious symbols from public view under a policy of secularism known as laïcité.
In 2004, the French government banned students from wearing religious symbols such
as yarmulkes, crosses, and hijabs (Muslim headscarves) in classrooms. 
Last year, the
French government relocated a statue
of Pope John Paul II, which included a cross, from public to private land after a
humanist organization sued.  
The goal of laïcité was
to foster social harmony
between different groups in a multicultural, multifaith society. But in
practice, the policy failed. Empowering the government to investigate and
suppress religious expression has only exacerbated religious division. 
Now the U.S. Supreme Court is faced with the same issue—whether to allow a cross-shaped memorial to World War I soldiers to survive on property that is maintained by an agency created by the state of Maryland.
In 1923, the American Legion worked with Gold Star Mothers to erect the Peace Cross memorial with private funds on private property in Bladensburg, Maryland. The memorial bears the American Legion’s symbol, a plaque with the names of 49 local soldiers who gave their lives, and the words “Valor, Endurance, Courage, Devotion.” 
Over the years, as the town of Bladensburg developed, the Peace Cross ended up in the middle of a traffic circle in Veterans Memorial Park alongside other commemorative symbols. 
Then, the American Humanist Association filed a lawsuit in 2014 on behalf of three plaintiffs who regularly drove by the Peace Cross and said they were psychologically offended by its presence. A lower court granted “standing” to the humanists, despite Supreme Court precedent that rejected the “offended observer” test.
During oral argument Feb. 27 at the Supreme Court, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg also highlighted the potential for the Peace Cross to “offend” those of other faiths. She pointed out that Americans are different now than we were during World War I, noting that at least 30 percent of Americans are now non-Christians. 
The American Humanist
Association’s lawyer described the Peace Cross as “too loud” and “too offensive,”
stating that when Jews, Muslims, and humanists saw the war memorial, they
“processed” it as a message that they are inferior and that their military
service is not valued.  
But when Chief Justice John Roberts reminded the lawyer that one of the fundraisers for the Peace Cross was Jewish, she dismissed his view as that of only one person.
 >>> Related: 6 Key Exchanges From the Peace Cross Oral Argument
Justices Stephen
Breyer and Neil Gorsuch both reminded the courtroom of America’s legacy of
religious pluralism.
“[A]ll our
liberties come from freedom of religion,” Breyer said. “You have your religion.
I have mine. We are not going to kill each other.” 
Gorsuch noted that
in America other people’s views must be tolerated, and
people must learn to deal with offense. He warned that involving
the government in censoring offensive speech would be to “dictate taste.” 
Roberts pointed out the existence of diverse religious symbols on
public property throughout the country, describing Native American totem poles
with spiritual meaning on public lands. 
In New York City, public schools display both the Jewish menorah and the Muslim crescent. And of public schools’ observance of Muslim religious holidays, Mayor Bill de Blasio said it was “a commonsense change and one that recognizes our growing Muslim community and honors its contributions to our city.” 
Other cases invoking the Constitution’s establishment clause have involved Jewish eruvs on public utility poles. An eruv demarcates an area where an adherent of Judaism may walk on the Sabbath to get to synagogue and is allowed to carry certain objects. 
Additionally, public servants have won the right to wear religious dress as they carry out their duties. Recently, the House of Representatives changed its rules on head coverings to accommodate Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., who wears a hijab. Similarly, Sikh soldiers have won the right to wear a turban. 
As the Jewish
Coalition for Religious Liberty noted, when the government allows
offense to limit the public presence of religious symbols, religious minorities
are the most likely to suffer. The public’s unfamiliarity with the symbols of
religious minorities are more likely to feed “distrust, suspicion, and even
hostility” toward them.
The totem pole, the eruv, the crescent moon: Each of these symbols
could cause offense to someone. According to the historic American
understanding of freedom, however, the government doesn’t take anything away
from anyone by allowing a symbol (secular or religious) merely to exist in the
public square. 
But
when the government censors symbols just because they are religious, pluralism necessarily
suffers. 
The
Founders recognized that we are not a
country of irreligious people. Nor are we a people who follow one religion. We
are a people who follow many religions. 
And although the establishment clause prevents the government from elevating one religion above all others through coercion or exclusion, that’s not what the Peace Cross in Bladensburg does. 
Our history, our pluralistic
identity, and the future of both majority and minority faiths are at stake in
this case. America’s unique path has enabled peaceful pluralism to flourish as
our country has become more religiously diverse. 
The Supreme Court
should honor our constitutional tradition by allowing the public square to be
full of symbols that reflect our diversity.

Madison Ferguson

Madison Ferguson is a member of the Young Leaders Program at The Heritage Foundation.
The House of Representatives voted on Thursday on a resolution condemning bigotry and hate. The resolution was spurred by the recent remarks of freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn, which questioned the loyalty of Jews to the United States. 
Both her anti-Semitic statements and broader views of religious freedom
deserve examination. 
The Center for American Progress recently called Omar “a champion of
religious freedom.” At an event entitled “Reclaiming Religious Freedom,” Omar urged the
need for “freedom, liberty, and justice for all” and bemoaned the fact that
some groups in America don’t fully experience these.  
She is correct on that point. All Americans should be free to live
according to their faiths without fear of government hostility, in public as
well as in private—regardless of whether their beliefs are shared by elected
officials.
But the promise of such depends, in large measure, upon government
officials demonstrating respect for the freedom of all citizens to peacefully
live according to their beliefs. 
Unfortunately, Omar’s own words and actions undermine progress toward religious freedom and justice for all.
Prejudice Against One Group Undermines Religious Freedom for All 
Omar’s anti-Semitic
comments suggesting that Jewish-American politicians are bought and paid for by
the government of Israel have drawn rebuke from both Democrats and Republicans.
Omar tweeted last month, “It’s all about the Benjamins baby”—a reference to $100 bills. 
She went on to state her belief that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee pays Jewish-American members of Congress to take pro-Israel stances.  
This statement echoed her earlier tweet: “Israel has hypnotized the world. May Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel.” 
Omar has also voiced her support for the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement (BDS) that aims to change Israeli policy toward the Palestinian population through economic pressure.
Anti-Semitism is
religious prejudice. Jews have a multifaceted identity that includes culture,
ethnicity, and religion. And while many Jews are secular, anti-Semitism targets
Jews as a whole and helps foment hostility toward Jewish religious beliefs, practices,
and identity. 
It is no coincidence that the anti-Semitic terrorist who took the lives of 11 Jews at the Tree of Life synagogue outside Pittsburgh chose to attack them at their house of prayer on the Sabbath—a day set aside for rest, religious observance, and celebration.
Unfortunately, anti-Semitism is on the rise not only around the world, but also in the United States. The Anti-Defamation League reported a 60 percent increase in anti-Semitic attacks in 2017. 
The FBI also recorded that Jews were the most targeted group for religious hate crimes. Of the 1,749 victims of anti-religious hate crimes, 58.1 percent were “victims of crimes motivated by their offenders’ anti-Jewish bias”—even though Jews represent only 2.2 percent of the American population. 
When a member of Congress suggests that a religious group
has dual loyalty to an external power, it creates a chilling effect for all
members of the community to express their identity in public. That was true in
the 1960s when critics accused
John F. Kennedy of dual loyalty to the Vatican, and it would be true if Omar
were accused of dual loyalty to Muslim governments. 
Every person of faith, every person who cares about
religious freedom, and every member of Congress should stand up and speak out
against anti-Semitism. World history shows that prejudice toward Jews is not easily
contained, but can quickly spread.  
Expressions of religious prejudice from government officials can foment religious bigotry within society as a whole, and an attitude of “religious freedom for me, but not for thee.” Omar’s anti-Semitic statements reveal a dangerously misguided understanding of religious freedom. 
Religious Freedom Protects Actions, Not Just Appearances
At the beginning of this
congressional term, the House changed its ban on headwear in the House gallery.
Omar was the catalyst for that change. It enables her to continue her Muslim
practice of wearing a hijab while serving in public office. 
At the Center for American Progress, she stated that she “visually presents her faith.” But she then undermined her view by denouncing the freedom of Christian adoption agencies to serve according to their religious beliefs. 
Omar was referring to the
decision of the Department of Health and Human Services to grant a waiver to
the state of South Carolina that enabled Miracle Hill Ministries to continue
serving foster children. The waiver, issued under the Obama administration, allows
Miracle Hill and other religious agencies to place foster children with parents
that share their own faith. 
The Constitution protects
this freedom as central to religious liberty. And it is a freedom that reflects
religious solidarity—not a rejection of outsiders.
As Howard Slugh, founder of
Jewish Coalition for Religious Liberty, has written, “Bonds
between members of the same faith rest on shared beliefs; they do not indicate
hatred of outsiders.”  
Slugh compared Miracle Hill’s stance to
efforts by American Jews to find Jewish families
for Jewish children fleeing persecution in Russia during the 1980s and 1990s,
noting that the “position [was not] based on spite or hatred.
Religious solidarity is the motivation.”
America is currently struggling with a
shortage of foster parents to care for the more than 437,500 children on the
waiting list. Government authorities need help from a broad diversity of
agencies in meeting this need. 
Secular and religious child welfare
agencies play distinct roles. Faith-based agencies are uniquely suited to
recruit families from their own communities—whether Christians, Jewish, or
Muslim—and to provide these loving families with spiritual care and support. 
During
this year’s National Prayer Breakfast, President Donald Trump acknowledged the
threat to religious liberty and pushed back by pledging that faith-based
agencies should be “free to follow their deeply held beliefs.”

This robust vision of religious freedom contrasts sharply with Omar, who was hailed at the Center for American Progress as someone who brings “faith into public policymaking and public service,” despite her own comment that we shouldn’t “externally practice our faith.”  
But an understanding of religious freedom that is limited to visual representation is remarkably impoverished. Religious freedom is more than wearing a hijab or carrying a rosary. It extends beyond prayer rugs and pews. Our Constitution protects our freedom to work and to serve according to our faiths in the public square. 
Religious Freedom Matters Most When We Disagree
In stark contrast to Omar,
another Democratic congresswoman has courageously spoken up for religious
freedom for all Americans, including in the workplace.  
When Sens. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, questioned a Nebraska judicial nominee about his fitness to serve because of his membership in the Knights of Columbus, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, a practicing Hindu, rose to his defense. 
She criticized the inquiries into his membership in the Catholic service organization citing Article VI of the Constitution, which bars “religious tests” for those seeking public office.
Gabbard wrote, “We
must call this out for what it is—religious bigotry. This is true not just
when such prejudice is anti-Catholic, but also when it is anti-Semitic,
anti-Muslim, anti-Hindu, or anti-Protestant, or any other religion.” 
Amid the growing
confusion in Congress over the constitutionality of religious tests, Gabbard’s
voice was a welcome call for equal treatment and the freedom to live according
to our beliefs in every sphere, not just in worship. 
She echoed President
George Washington, who wrote to the Newport Hebrew Congregation in 1790, “All
possess alike liberty of conscience and immunities of citizenship.” 
Our commitments to
religious freedom are most deeply tested when we are asked to protect the
freedom of those whose beliefs are different from our own. 
Omar’s anti-Semitism, impoverished view of religious
freedom, and intolerance toward religious differences must not become the new normal in Congress—or
anywhere. 
As Democrats and
Republicans settle into their roles in the 116th Congress, our representatives should
work to fulfill the promise of religious freedom for all Americans.

Like a strong cocktail that promises a quick buzz, social media
offers us instant gratification that can be hard to resist. 
But just as alcohol disguises the smell of chemicals, social
media hides the bitter poison of identity politics—a poison that increasingly
dominates the content we read. 
This toxic cocktail is killing our freedom to speak the truth. And
sadly, some of the world’s most powerful companies are siding against freedom
and truth.
Twitter’s latest move against free thought came in the form of a
ban on “misgendering” and “deadnaming.” This essentially means users who use pronouns
and names that align with a person’s biology rather than their professed gender
identity will be punished. 
This is a victory of feelings over facts. Big tech is enabling identity politics to dominate the virtual public square—and it’s even aiding its takeover of the real one, too. 
Take the United
Kingdom. In England, police have already used tweets to investigate and arrest
citizens for referring to individuals according to their biology rather than
transgender ideology. In two separate incidents, police responded to complaints
against women from men who identify as women. 
Police arrested Kate Scottow at home in front of her children and then held her in a jail cell for seven hours after transgender activist Anthony Halliday (aka Stephanie Hayden) accused her of “misgendering” him. 
Halliday/Hayden also seemed to suggest that transgender activists ought to “[storm] into” a parish church to ask “robust questions” of a priest’s wife who has opposed transgender ideology.
Stephanie thinks I need robust questioning over my beliefs. After their friend Dr Harrop tried to intimidate me by tweeting photos of our church & saying they would come here, they think they are justified in storming a church because they don’t like the priest’s wife’s views. pic.twitter.com/nxM1wUfKI1
Police also went after a 74-year–old woman named Margaret Nelson. The reason: She posted two statements on Twitter that didn’t accord with transgender ideology: “gender is fashionable nonsense” and “in life or in death, trans women are not women, no matter how many times you say it’s so.” 
Forced to Speak Untruths
In the novel “1984,” George
Orwell coined the phrase “Big Brother is watching” to refer to the government.
Today, he’d have to include social media companies as enforcers. 
Twitter’s ban on “misgendering”
and “deadnaming” crosses a red line. Twitter users should be able to choose what
pronouns and names they use for each other. When Twitter punishes users for misgendering
and deadnaming, the company pressures us to speak untruths. 
Princeton University professor
Robert George has warned,
“Ordinary authoritarians are content to forbid people from saying things they
know or believe to be true. Totalitarians insist on forcing people to say
things they know or believe to be untrue.”
Social media companies’ embrace of identity politics has led to biased enforcement of content standards that favors transgender activists. 
In Canada, for instance, feminist journalist Meghan Murphy testified before the Canadian Senate against the notorious Bill C-16, which added “misgendering” to the human rights code and criminal code in May 2017. In August 2018, Twitter told her to delete tweets that referred to a biological man, Ryan Kreut (who self-identifies as a woman named Lisa), as a man. 
Then, last November, Murphy tweeted several rhetorical questions: “How are transwomen not men? What is the difference between a man and a transwoman?” She referred to transgender activist Jonathan Yaniv according to his biology. In the past he had filed lawsuits against female beauticians who refused to give him “bikini waxes.”
Twitter classified these statements from Murphy as hateful and permanently shut down her account. Yaniv then bragged that he was personally responsible for getting Murphy banned from Twitter.
Murphy is now suing Twitter over the ban.
Companies like Twitter clearly see themselves as defending transgender individuals. But they are much more passive about enforcing “hateful conduct” policies when it comes to protecting women from transgender activists. 
Trans activists frequently target Murphy and others by name, referring to them as trans-exclusionary radical feminists (TERFs). A website called terfisaslur.com displays tweets like “All TERFs deserve to be shot in the head.” “All TERFS need to cease existing. Wipe them from the earth.” 
Transgender activists have also targeted Kaeley Triller, co-founder
of Hands Across the Aisle, a coalition of women opposed to transgender ideology,
on Facebook by posting her home address and violently threatening her children. 
“Ironically,” Triller says, “the least ‘safe spaces’ in the
history of the world are spaces where speech is censored and dissent is
punished. If people are not safe to disagree, they are not safe at all.” 
Social media companies
could be protecting women from the violent, graphic, and threatening content against
feminists documented at terfisaslur.com, but instead, Twitter is “protecting”
those who identify as transgender from the “hateful conduct” of those who
simply say that we are born male and female.
The Eclipse of Women’s Rights
For a brief moment during the #MeToo movement, it seemed that women were ascending the identity politics hierarchy. But as PayPal founder Peter Thiel predicted, when conflict comes between identity groups, the solution will be brokered in a way that most benefits the left as a coalition, not any particular group. 
Twitter and Facebook’s double standards are proving Thiel
correct. Transgenderism is making war on feminism, and feminists are losing
out.
Identity politics is poisonous to freedom. It divides Americans up
by ethnicity, race, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, etc., and ranks
us in a hierarchy based upon degrees of “victimization.” 
This is deeply out of step with America’s founding, which
championed the legal equality of each citizen based on inalienable natural rights.
It is also out of step with the way most Americans developed their
identities—from their families, religious communities, and civic groups. 
But as our society has become more atomized, identity politics has filled the void and offered an alternative kind of social identity—albeit a toxic one.
The Marxist struggle, which originally was seen as a struggle for power between economic classes, has been recast as a struggle between social identity groups. Individual guilt, virtue, and responsibility are replaced with collective guilt, virtue, and responsibility. And because this scheme treats the group as the fundamental unit of responsibility and agency, individual freedoms become irrelevant. At worst, they are seen as tools that “oppressors” can use to exploit the “oppressed.” 
We should not be surprised, then, when incidents of identity politics seem to reveal a totalitarian streak. Identity politics doesn’t just produce a grievance culture, it produces a vengeance culture—one that never ends and can never be resolved. 
When students and faculty who hold unpopular views are shouted down or even physically assaulted, we are witnessing the fruit of a tree that is rotten to the core. 
Identity politics requires the jettisoning of America’s
constitutional heritage. It would ultimately replace ordered liberty with a
society in which freedoms are enjoyed only by those who have earned them
through victimization.
Tech Giants Driving the Train
Twitter, Facebook, and Apple are among 107
major companies that have endorsed federal legislation that would make
“misgendering” a punishable offense. Named the “Equality
Act,” this bill is anything but.
State and local bureaucrats have already used similar laws and policies to derail the careers of people like high school teacher Peter Vlaming and professor Nicholas Meriwether at Shawnee State University because they referred to students according to biology and not gender ideology. 
These laws give government control over our freedom to speak and think according to the truth. The Equality Act would extend that to all 50 states.
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, the great Russian writer who
survived life in the Soviet
gulag, once told the Nobel
Prize Committee: “One word of truth shall outweigh the whole world.” 
As big tech seeks to restructure both our virtual and
brick-and-mortar public squares according to the frame of identity politics, now
more than ever, we must fight for the freedom to use language to speak the truth.

The United Nations will host its annual
gathering in New York this week. But amid all the hubbub, President Donald
Trump is setting aside time to speak on a pressing issue: religious freedom and
persecution around the world. 
The president will keynote an event Monday called the Global Call to Protect Religious Freedom. This is exactly the right issue to focus on at the U.N.
Today, more than 80% of the world’s population
lives under serious restrictions of religious freedom, according to the Pew
Research Center. In places like Iran, Burma, and the Chinese province of Xinjiang,
religious minorities like Christians, Rohingya Muslims, and Uighur Muslims face
threats to their very existence. 
Attacks on religious believers fuel social
instability, violent conflict, and the deterioration of other human rights. 
By calling upon all nations to protect religious freedom, the president will be giving a voice to those who too often lack one. He will also be celebrating a principle that is foundational to peace and security. 
His call for religious freedom is
particularly needed in light of this year’s attacks on synagogues, mosques, and
churches, which have claimed the lives of innocent Jews, Muslims, and
Christians. From Pittsburgh and San Diego to Sri Lanka and New Zealand,
religious freedom is under threat. 
In 1948, the nations of the world pledged
in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to protect every human being’s
freedom to adopt or change religious belief, and to live out those beliefs in
the public square in addition to private life. 
The U.N. has sadly strayed from this
heritage and, with a new initiative, has become a threat to religious freedom. 
Earlier this year, U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres launched a Strategy and Plan of Action on Hate Speech as part of an effort to counter attacks on religious minorities. While well-intended, this effort is the wrong approach and would likely backfire.
The problem with hate speech laws is that
the powerful use them to redefine disagreement itself as a form of discrimination.
If you hold a certain opinion that powerful elites disagree with, your speech may
soon be called “hateful” and “discriminatory.”
By nature, free people disagree with one
another in an infinite number of ways. If we are to remain free, we must be
able to disagree without fear of punishment. Hate speech laws would quash
dissent in violation of liberal norms. 
The U.N. should take particular issue with
hate speech laws, given its task of supporting the liberal order. Hate speech laws
empower governments to censor their citizens when they express their values and
beliefs, including religious beliefs. The U.N. ought to openly reject hate
speech laws.
In the realm of religion, the stakes are especially high. Abrahamic religions and other faiths offer truth-seekers different and mutually exclusive belief systems regarding the meaning of life, the existence of God, and the nature of good and evil. 
Freedom allows the seeker to compare these
claims, choose among them, and then order his or her life around them. And such
beliefs are found everywhere, in every culture. Protecting their freedom to
choose and practice a religion is central to their flourishing.  
Unfortunately, the concept of hate speech is all too often wielded to silence comparisons between ideas that are essential to truth-seekers. 
For example, the Organization of Islamic
Cooperation has actively advanced blasphemy laws at the U.N. under the
misleading moniker “defamation of religions.” In Pakistan, the government has
used blasphemy laws to punish the weak, religious minorities, and women. 
One Catholic mother of five, Asia Bibi, spent years on death row simply because a co-worker with a personal grievance accused her of insulting the prophet Muhammed. Her acquittal sparked nationwide rioting. 
Rather than pacifying the hostility,
blasphemy laws fomented social intolerance and violence by legitimizing the
idea that offensive words cause injury and should be punished—the same notion
that defines hate speech.
Although the specifics of the U.N. secretary
general’s plan have yet to be fully articulated, the U.N.’s own track record presents
a cause for concern. 
One impetus for the campaign is the rise of anti-Semitism—a valid concern on its face. Yet resolutions at the U.N. routinely delegitimize, demonize, and apply double standards to the Jewish state of Israel. Political leaders—including some in the U.S.—have recently unleashed old anti-Semitic tropes. 
Combating anti-Semitism does not require giving
political leaders the power to shut down speech. Government leaders should
address the anti-Semitism within their own ranks, and the United Nations should
take a hard look at its own anti-Semitic resolutions.
In another disturbing trend at the U.N., a
designated official called the independent expert on protection against
violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity
called for religious and political leaders to be held accountable for speech
that the U.N. deems “homophobic or transphobic.” 
European governments have already punished
pastors and imams for stating that marriage is between a man and a woman. The U.N.
should not exacerbate this illiberal trend by treating reasonable disagreements
about sexuality and marriage as discrimination. 
In 1992, the U.S. Senate ratified the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, a U.N. treaty that binds
signatory nations to protect a list of political rights. When ratifying it, the
Senate made a reservation to Article 20, which prohibits advocacy of “national,
racial, or religious hatred.” 
The senators who made that reservation
certainly did not condone hatred. But they were discerning. They saw that such
a rule could be misused and wielded to restrict freedom. After all, as a nation
founded by religious dissenters, Americans know how easily terms like hate can
be used by the powerful to limit the speech of the powerless. 
As the U.N. meets again, the U.S. should lead the world on a
different path. Instead of promoting the misguided idea of hate speech,
countries should focus on empowering the oppressed by protecting religious
liberty and free speech for all, and by calling upon politicians and U.N.
bureaucrats to examine their own biases.
A plaque at the Statue of Liberty is inscribed: “Liberty is the air America breathes…” 
Liberty is essential for people around the world to seek knowledge about the truth, and to speak up against those who oppress them based on their beliefs. 
Even the most well-intended plans to combat anti-religious attacks through restrictions on speech will be counterproductive. Extinguishing liberty won’t simply suppress vile ideas—it will also snuff out those who speak from their conscience.

Childhood used to be a time
of innocence. But as our culture has become more and more sexualized, children
have become the casualties of adult exploitation. 
The New York Times just
reported that more than 45 million online photos and videos of children being
sexually abused were reported by tech companies, more than double what they
found the previous year. 
In culture, education, and
health care, American children also are increasingly targeted for sexual
messages, images, and themes at younger ages. Sometimes, this is even supported
by taxpayer money through government-led initiatives.
Our culture is saturated with
sexual content that was once considered too risqué for children, and social
media has accelerated the spread of pornography to young viewers. 
The American Academy of Pediatrics reports that in the United
States, 42% of children between 10 and 17 have viewed pornography online. 
Social media also has become prime hunting ground for sex traffickers. In March 2019, Instagram was reportedly the leading social media platform for child grooming by sexual predators.
A recent poll of 2,000 teens
found that nearly 75% had received pornographic direct messages from strangers,
even if they had a private account. And 55% of victims of sex trafficking in 2015 met their abuser through a
website, app, or text. 
The sexualization of children
is occurring in brick-and-mortar spaces too as “drag queen story hours,” in
which cross-dressing adult entertainers interact with children in
taxpayer-funded local libraries, have appeared across the country. 
In education, the United
Nations promotes Comprehensive Sexual Education around the world. In America,
groups such as Planned Parenthood, Human Rights Campaign, and the Gay, Lesbian,
and Straight Education Network promote “comprehensive”
sexual education, which includes instruction about homosexual practices, transgender
theory, and abortion.
Colorado mandates such
curriculum for students in elementary school and recently considered stripping
away parental opt-out provisions. 
Sexual orientation and gender
identity curriculum is not limited to sex education. California, New Jersey,
and Illinois passed laws
requiring schools to teach about the “political, social, and economic
contributions of … lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people,” which
frequently include dubious assertions about the sexual orientation or gender
identity of historical figures that are irrelevant to their achievements. 
The House of Representatives
recently passed the Equality Act, which would amend Title IV of the Civil
Rights Act to include sexual orientation and gender identity as protected
characteristics. This curriculum could be required if the Equality Act were to
become law. 
The Department of Education
under the Obama administration pressured schools to implement transgender
policies that pose risks to children’s privacy and safety. In Georgia, Pascha Thomas’
5-year-old daughter was sexually assaulted in a restroom at an elementary
school that adopted a gender identity-based access policy without notifying
parents. 
Efforts to expose children to
age-inappropriate content and make parental notification and opt-out difficult
or impossible undermine parents’ constitutional right to control their
children’s education on sensitive topics such as human sexuality. Public
schools should not become a place where children are exposed to radical sexual
ideology.
Finally, the increased
prevalence of transgender ideology in culture and education has narrowed the
treatment options for children with gender dysphoria. 
Transgender activists pressure both doctors and parents to consent to “gender-affirming medical treatment” for children who otherwise likely would grow to accept their bodies. Such treatment typically starts with puberty blockers at age 8, cross-sex hormones at 14, and genital surgery for boys as young as 17. In one case, a 13-year-old girl was given a double mastectomy.
The detrimental side effects of hormones, such as increased depression, loss of bone density, and sterility, are well-known. Yet 15 states have banned counseling for gender-dysphoric children that would help them become comfortable with their biological sex.  
The Equality Act, if passed,
would make medical professionals liable to lawsuits for gender identity
discrimination if they declined to do “sex reassignment” procedures on
children, regardless of conscientious objection or best medical judgment. 
The Trump administration
reversed policies under the Obama administration that created the same
liabilities, but parents continue to find that the medical system and the legal
system are working against them. In Ohio, a couple lost custody
of their daughter because they refused to allow her to take testosterone.
Combating the premature
sexualization of children by adults requires focused attention from both lawmakers
and courageous parents.  
On Wednesday, Oct. 9, The Heritage Foundation and Family Policy Alliance will co-host a Summit on Protecting Children from Sexualization to examine these issues in-depth. The summit also will debut the National Parents Resource Guide on the Transgender Trend. RSVP for the event or watch the livestream here.

Women shouldn’t have to compete against men in order to play sports. 
Yet that’s exactly what is happening increasingly across the country and around the world, as a growing number of male athletes who self-identify as women are being allowed to enter women’s competitions. 
The so-called Equality Act would only worsen this trend. This piece of federal legislation, being pushed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., would create a civil right for male athletes to self-identify as females at any time, without any evidence of physical changes to their bodies. 
It would spell “the end of women’s sports,” in the words of Duke University Law School professor Doriane Lambelet Coleman, who testified against the bill at a recent House Judiciary Committee hearing. 
But at that hearing, Sunu Chandy of the National Women’s Law Center trivialized these concerns. She stated, “We do not create policy about myths and stereotypes … There’s no research to support the claim that allowing trans athletes to play on teams that fit their gender identity will create a competitive imbalance.” 
Yet such evidence does exist. There is plenty of empirical
evidence showing that replacing “sex” with “gender identity” as a criterion for
entry into athletic competition would eliminate opportunities for the athletic
abilities of large numbers of women to be properly recognized.  
In the case of Mack Beggs, a female wrestler who identifies as male, she was allowed to take testosterone. That led three of her female competitors to forfeit the competition out of fear of being injured.
As Coleman testified in the hearing, “So overwhelming is the advantage of testosterone that thousands of men and boys could defeat the female Olympic gold medalists in the 400 meters.” 
She also wrote in The New York Times, “It doesn’t matter that there are 100 females and three males in a girls’ race if the three males win spots in the final or on the podium because they are males.”  
>>> Her Daughter Has to Compete Against Biological Males in Track. Now This Mom Is Speaking Out.
Everyone has the right to compete in sports, but creating a
right to compete on the basis of gender identity won’t simply add a right. It
will eliminate the right of women and girls to compete against members of their
own sex. 
 In 1972, Congress
passed Title IX of the 1972 Educational Amendments to the Civil Rights Act, which
ordered schools to create separate athletic teams for women. Congress didn’t simply
tell schools to let women compete for spots on men’s teams. That would have
been self-defeating, as only a few exceptional female athletes would win spots
due to men’s greater physical power, strength, and speed. 
Yet despite ample scientific evidence of males’ physical advantages over females, supporters of the Equality Act like Yale University School of Law professor Kenji Yoshino insist that “trans women have not broadly displaced or disadvantaged non-trans women or girls when allowed to compete in accordance with their gender.”
>>>
Look
to States for Preview of Havoc the ‘Equality Act’ Would Wreak
But even without the Equality Act, women and girls are losing
titles, medals, and scholarship opportunities in states where gender identity has
already replaced sex. H.R. 5 would dramatically accelerate and expand these adverse impacts on females by requiring athletic programs to recognize
gender identity as a protected class in order to receive federal funding. 
Here are 10 examples of male athletes identifying as women
in female sports. Under the Equality Act, we could only expect more of this.
In the last example, 16-year-old Selina Soule described the race as “demoralizing” because, when male athletes enter women and girls races, everyone knows who will win before the race begins. Even worse, her chances of being seen by college scouts disappeared when Yearwood and Miller took top spots at the state championships. 
Soule said she chose to speak out so that no other girl
athlete would face the same disappointment. Hopefully, Congress will listen to
voices like hers before it’s too late.

"As Chick-fil-A is learning, there is no ""enough"" in the vocabulary of the high priests of progressivism.  (Photo: Jeffrey Greenberg/Universal Images Group/Getty Images)

The angry backlash against their belief that marriage is between a man and a woman started on social media. Soon activists called for a boycott. Then officials banned them from selling in a key market. Faced with mounting social, economic, and legal attacks on their business, the company’s leadership was faced with an impossible decision: conscience or livelihood?
No, the scene was not the Georgia corporate headquarters of Chick-fil-A, America’s third-largest fast food chain. It was the home of Steve and Bridget Tennes, a Catholic family who run Country Mill Farms in Michigan.
>>> Watch the Tennes family’s story:
A Facebook discussion about their beliefs on marriage led LGBT activists to call for boycotts. The East Lansing City Council declared that their beliefs themselves constituted discrimination and banned them from selling their apples at the farmer’s market.
The controversy over Chick-fil-A’s decision to end financial giving to the Salvation Army and Fellowship of Christian Athletes has spotlighted the conundrum faced by people nationwide whose values don’t line up with progressives’ new orthodoxy.
We can make too little and too much out of this incident. One way to underestimate it is to think it only happens on Wall Street. It’s happening as much on Main Street, with more dire economic consequences for smaller businesses and for individuals.
Another mistake would be to assume this is a one-off in a “culture war” from which businesses can simply choose to drop out. Chick-fil-A didn’t start the war over marriage, and it won’t be able to simply drop out. Instead, LGBT activists are forcing it to pick sides.
The attacks on Country Mill Farms and Chick-fil-A follow a pattern. Four types of attack lead to freedom’s decline. It starts with social ostracization, then economic discrimination, then legal punishment (including criminal penalties), and often ends in violence, either by the state or the mob.
We pay attention to these attacks overseas in their final stages, but often miss how gradual the decline of freedom is and fail to recognize them in our own country.
In 2012, when Chick-fil-A CEO Dan Cathy said he believes what billions of Jews, Christians, and Muslims around the world believe about marriage, LGBT activists swiftly attacked in the media and launched boycotts that have become international. Officials sought to ban the restaurant from selling in airports, college campuses, and metropolitan centers.
When the Family Research Council supported Cathy’s stance on marriage, a vigilante set out to assassinate its employees simply because they disagree on marriage. A security guard foiled the plan, but not before taking a bullet himself. Chick-fil-A’s story includes all four types of attack.
Worldwide, the forces who seek to impose orthodoxy follow the same playbook. There is one right belief which is sacred. Everyone must conform. Dissenters must be punished.
And as Chick-fil-A is learning, there is no “enough” in the vocabulary of the high priests of progressivism. After it announced the end of its support for the Salvation Army and Fellowship of Christian Athletes, an LGBT group, GLAAD, said the company should next “unequivocally speak out against the anti-LGBTQ reputation that their brand represents.” Others said the company should “make amends for past statements and deeds” by donating to pro-LGBT groups. Reparations, anyone?
The cornerstone of the LGBT movement’s legal strategy is to convince people that mere disagreement on marriage and biological sex is anti-LGBT discrimination, even though it’s no such thing. Tim Gill, the multimillionaire whom Rolling Stone calls the “megadonor behind the LGBTQ rights movement,” has bragged that these laws will be used to “punish the wicked.”
Here is where we could make too much out of this story. Chick-fil-A leadership’s reported decision to disavow charities that align with values that the company once espoused has demoralized many. And millions are still hoping the company will issue a clear statement of support for the deserving charities that progressives have sought to demonize.
But ultimately, the future of freedom won’t only be determined in corporate boardrooms. It will be determined by whether the American people and their representatives can rightly distinguish between disagreement and discrimination.
Firefighters, pilots, entertainers, and tech CEOs have lost jobs, promotions, and access to markets because they refused to go along with the new orthodoxy. The Tennes family chose to fight and are four years into litigation against the city of East Lansing.
The future of freedom depends on whether we can live with difference and respect the consciences of all in the marketplace. If not, we risk seeing things get even uglier.

"Two bills in Congress introduce controversial sexual orientation and gender identity language that could have far-reaching consequences. (Photo: Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images)

Nicholas Marr

Nicholas Marr is a member of the Young Leaders Program at The Heritage Foundation.
Congress is right when it considers policies
that serve the most vulnerable Americans, particularly children and the elderly,
who are most susceptible to abuse. 
But such policies come under threat when controversial
gender ideology is injected into the language of otherwise good legislation.
That’s what is happening with two bills under consideration: the Stronger Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act and the Older Americans Act. 
The sexual orientation and gender identity language in these bills threatens to elevate the political priorities of some at the cost of the safety, privacy, and liberty of many. It could obstruct the work of service providers in these fields as it already has in the areas of homelessness and foster care. 
Moreover, such language could drive a wedge between parents and their children. 
Dangers of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Language
Recent debates in the House over the Equality Act highlighted some of the perils of adding the language of gender identity and sexual orientation into federal law. 
Because of state laws that enshrine this language, medical providers are being sued because they do not support transgender activists’ recommended medical treatments for gender dysphoria. These include the experimental use of hormones on children as young as 8 and double mastectomies on girls as young as 13. 
There is vigorous debate in the medical community about the best treatments for gender dysphoria. 
Some distinguished professionals do not think transition surgery is good medicine. Yet in 15 states, transgender activists have already succeeded in banning counseling that would allow parents and children to undergo a period of “watchful waiting” to see if children become comfortable with their bodies. This is unwise. 
Individuals who suffer from anorexia, bulimia, body integrity identity disorder (the desire for loss of a limb or a sense), or gender dysphoria experience deep discomfort with their bodies, which can lead to mistaken beliefs about themselves and reality. 
But, as Ryan T. Anderson has explained:
The most helpful therapies focus not on achieving the impossible—changing bodies to conform to thoughts and feelings—but on helping people accept and even embrace the truth about their bodies and reality. A sound understanding of physical and mental health [and] medicine [aims] at restoring health, not simply satisfying the desires of patients.
Studies show that 80% to 95% of gender-dysphoric children eventually grow out of their dysphoria and become comfortable with their bodies after puberty if there is no hormonal or surgical intervention. 
Moreover, those who undergo sex-reassignment surgery commit suicide at 19 times the rate of the general population, and almost double the rate of transgender-identifying adults overall. 
This high rate is not simply owing to a
failure of society to accept transgenderism. Adults like Walt Heyer who suffered
from gender dysphoria, and now regret having pursued sex-reassignment, say counseling
saved them from suicide. 
James Shupe, who attributes his gender dysphoria to PTSD and other traumas, said the transgender community’s medical recommendations endangered his life. 
“It did not help me at all,” Shupe said. “It destabilized my mental health, because I was living in a false reality. I was fighting my body. I was fighting society. I perfectly understand why this kills people and why there’s such a high suicide rate. Society gets the blame. It’s not society. It’s the program itself that’s killing us.”
This “program” recently led a government agency in Cincinnati to charge parents of a gender-dysphoric girl with child abuse when they expressed a preference for counseling and would not consent to testosterone treatments for their daughter. 
After the agency’s charge against the parents, a state judge terminated the couple’s parental rights. 
Similarly, in Illinois, the state has mandated that its child welfare employees and prospective foster parents follow the recommendations of the transgender movement or else be disqualified from serving. 
A prospective foster parent who wants to allow a gender-dysphoric child a period of “watchful waiting” will be weeded out of the prospective pool of families. 
This move is especially misguided at a time when there are 17,920 children on the waiting list for foster families in Illinois (and more than 437,500 children nationwide).
Putting Transgender Ideology Into Law
The House version of the Stronger Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, or H.R. 2480, which passed in May, would expand abuse-prevention outreach requirements to include “sexual and gender minority youth.” 
The bill itself does not define the term, but references the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s definition of “sexual minority youth” that also includes the term “transgender.”  
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s use of the terminology of transgender theory adopts one side of the debate over the best medical treatments for gender dysphoria. 
In addition to incorporating the terminology of the transgender movement, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cites one of the most powerful transgender lobbying organizations, the National Center for Transgender Equality, as a resource. It openly promotes sex-reassignment procedures and supports litigation against those who hold a different view. 
The National Center for Transgender Equality website states” 
It is illegal discrimination for your health insurance plan to refuse to cover medically necessary transition-related care. … For example, if a plan covers breast reconstruction for cancer treatment, or hormones to treat post-menopause symptoms, it cannot exclude these procedures to treat gender dysphoria.
This isn’t dangerous for the activists, but rather, for people who suffer from gender dysphoria, including youth. 
And new language in the legislation requires state governors who receive federal funds for child abuse prevention to ensure the state will integrate efforts with organizations that partner with “sexual and gender minority youth.” 
Medical associations, medical professionals, de-transitioners, biological parents, and prospective parents all stand to be harmed if federal law adopts the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention terminology and accepts the transgender community’s recommended medical treatments for gender dysphoria. 
If the bill passes the Senate with the same language as the
House version, the federal government’s treatment of vulnerable children and
youth will be increasingly under the control of the transgender movement’s
political ideology. 
But, as Princeton University professor Robert P. George states, “Changing sexes is a metaphysical impossibility because it is a biological impossibility.” 
Changes to law that require service providers to affirm sex-reassignment as the only valid treatment for gender dysphoria could ultimately reduce the pool of available providers and lead to greater harms to gender-dysphoric children and their parents. 
Research Being Ignored
To strengthen efforts to address child abuse, lawmakers should consider the well-documented and widely-agreed upon evidence on family structure. 
The House version of the child abuse legislation draws on the most recent National Incidence Study of Child Abuse to make recommendations, including preference under the Adoption Opportunities program for “sexual and gender minority youth.” 
But the legislation does not address the population that is statistically most at risk—children in unstable families. 
Indeed, the bill seems to ignore the study’s findings on family structure, including that children living with a single parent and their unmarried partner were sexually abused at a rate nearly 20 times higher than children living with their married biological parents. 
When lawmakers create conditions for service providers to
partner with the government, they should rely on the highest quality and most
reliable research, not on controversial political ideology. 
Hopefully the Senate will give weight to the evidence that the research provides about family structure and incorporate this information into its public-private partnerships. 
Doing so would go a long way toward empowering service providers, rather than crowding them out if they don’t assent to controversial new gender ideology.
Legislation Could Backfire on the Elderly
The other community at risk is the elderly. 
As Congress considers modernizing the Older Americans Act, Sens. Michael Bennet, D-Colo.; Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska; and Bob Casey, D-Pa.; have introduced the Inclusive Aging Act. 
This proposal would establish an Office of Inclusivity and Sexual Health within the Administration on Aging, as well as a new grant program to be carried out under that office. 
The new grant program would follow the
troubling trend of making transgender theory into a political litmus test that
excludes some service providers, including faith-based ones, from participating
in government-run programs, obtaining licensing, or serving communities in need. 
Organizations that follow a biology-based
definition of sex rather than transgender theory may not be able to satisfy new
requirements in the Older Americans Act unless they offer the full array of
“sexual health services,” or that they have a “formal relationship” with
organizations that assist LGBT individuals. 
The legislation would establish an Office of
Inclusivity, and only elder care providers who can prove they embrace LGBT
ideology will be eligible for grant money. 
In California and Murkowski’s home state of Alaska, both faith-based and secular women’s homeless shelters are embroiled in litigation over whether transgender theory will override the sex-segregation of private facilities such as sleeping facilities and showers. 
Similarly, the introduction of transgender theory into the elder care arena could complicate the work of facilities such as nursing homes that have sex-segregated private facilities.
Letting Faith Groups Continue to Serve
These are the clear harms that could result if the government conditions efforts to care for the vulnerable on assent to controversial new political views about sexuality and sex differences. 
Many in this nation are moved to care for the least among us because of their faith. Each year in America, an estimated 350,000 religious congregations operate schools, pregnancy resource centers, soup kitchens, drug addiction programs, homeless shelters, and adoption agencies that serve 70 million Americans. 
The value of their services is estimated at $44.3 billion annually. Religious organizations account for 40% of the top 50 U.S. charities.
But if these
organizations and others must accept beliefs about sexuality and sex
differences that are opposed to scientific and medical knowledge and to their
religious beliefs, they may not be able to continue serving. And without their
contributions, the federal government may not have enough resources to serve
the needy. 
Lawmakers should consider these problems before politicizing the care of the elderly and children.

"The Supreme Court heard oral argument Wednesday over the constitutionality of the Peace Cross, a 93-year-old memorial honoring World War I dead. (Photo: The Washington Post/Getty Images)

Elizabeth Slattery writes about the proper role of the courts, judicial nominations, and the Constitution as a legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation. Read her research. She hosts SCOTUS101, a podcast about everything that’s happening at the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court heard oral argument Wednesday in a case
challenging the constitutionality of a World War I memorial in Bladensburg,
Maryland. 
In American Legion v. American Humanist Association, the Supreme
Court will weigh in on whether a state’s maintenance of a 93-year-old World War
I memorial that includes a 40-foot cross—known as the Peace Cross—is an
“establishment of religion” in violation of the First Amendment. 
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit held that the Peace Cross violates the establishment clause, concluding that the size and prominence of the cross convey government endorsement of Christianity and the state’s maintenance of the cross is an excessive entanglement with religion. One of the judges went so far as to suggest a way to “fix” the establishment clause problem would be to cut off the arms of the cross. 
It was a packed house Wednesday at the Supreme Court, with three lawyers arguing on behalf of the Peace Cross’ constitutionality and a fourth arguing against. The justices came prepared with a lot of questions and at times talked over each other and the four advocates.

Neal
Katyal, a former Obama administration attorney and second-in-command for then-Solicitor
General Elena Kagan, represented the Maryland-National Capital Park and
Planning Commission, the state agency charged with the memorial’s upkeep. 
Michael
Carvin, an attorney with Jones Day who’s argued a number of high-profile cases,
represented the American Legion. Jeff Wall of the U.S. Solicitor General’s
Office represented the federal government. Monica Miller of the American
Humanist Association made her Supreme Court debut arguing against the Peace
Cross. 
Here are six key exchanges from the oral argument. 
1. What Message Does the Peace Cross Convey?
Katyal was the first up to the podium, and he got only a few sentences in before Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan jumped in, wanting to know more about the Peace Cross and its message. 
Katyal
explained that the American Legion’s symbol is featured prominently on the
cross and there is no other religious content in the park where it sits. It’s
located on a median within a busy traffic roundabout. This wasn’t always the
case, but over the years, the roads around the Peace Cross were expanded, to
the point that the state of Maryland became concerned about traffic safety and
acquired the site from the American Legion. 
The
American Legion holds an annual event at the site on Veterans Day, and there
have been no religious events held there. 
Katyal noted that there’s a clear secular purpose for this monument, and that, indeed, one of the key initial fundraisers for the privately-funded cross was Jewish. He explained that there is a long tradition of using the cross to memorialize the soldiers who died in World War I. It was “the dominant image of the time, everything from [the field of Flanders] poem to art, to the war bond advertisements … to the 1924 congressional resolution.”

2. Kagan’s Five Crosses 
Kagan
suggested that if a local government tried to put up a cross like this today,
it would be problematic. She posed a hypothetical with five different kinds of
crosses: a World War I memorial cross erected 93 years ago, a World War I
memorial cross erected today, a generic war memorial cross, a cross
memorializing those who died in some other kind of tragedy, and a cross that
was unrelated to any war or tragedy and didn’t memorialize anyone. She wanted
to know which of these crosses are permissible under the First Amendment’s establishment
clause, and why.  
Wall explained that the first four examples would most certainly be constitutional, and the fifth would depend on the purpose because context matters. He pointed to the Supreme Court’s 2014 ruling in Town of Greece v. Galloway, saying traditions that could be traced back to the founding era or those that posed no greater danger than what the Founders were concerned about should withstand constitutional scrutiny. 
Wall pointed out that our nation has a long tradition of accommodating religious symbols, including crosses. Kagan retorted that the cross is the “pre-eminent symbol of Christianity,” but Wall noted that it has “a unique history to World War I” in memorializing those who died in service to our country. 
Later in the argument, Miller was asked which crosses on public land should be allowed to stand. Justice Samuel Alito mentioned the Irish Brigade monument in Gettysburg. Miller answered: Only those in settings where the cross is akin to an artifact in a museum and the government acts “like a curator.”
3. ‘Is It Too Loud?’ 
Alito
asked Miller what kind of monument a town could put up to memorialize those who
died in a shooting at a synagogue. She responded that an obelisk with a Star of
David would be permissible, but a 40-foot Star of David would be problematic. 
She continued, “Is it too loud?” or does “the commemorative purpose predominate?”

the Peace Cross Case Represents the Best of America
Justice
Neil Gorsuch then jumped at the opportunity to bring up standing to bring a
lawsuit in the first place. He said, “We have to tolerate one another” in this
country, but this is the “only area [of the law where] we allow people to sue
over offense” alone. “Why shouldn’t we apply normal standing rules that require
more than offense?” Gorsuch asked. 
Miller answered that the Peace Cross and other similar monuments send the message that “non-Christians are inferior” and “lesser citizen[s].” She continued, noting that the Peace Cross’ reference to valor, endurance, courage, and devotion “translates to Christian valor, Christian courage,” and so on. 
Chief Justice John Roberts asked if one complaint from one person should be enough to bring a lawsuit. Miller replied, “No … it would have to be that you are a member of the community” and you are “personally affected by the message.” 
4. How Should the Supreme Court Determine What an ‘Establishment’ of Religion Is? 
Time and
again, the conversation came back to which test the Supreme Court should use to
evaluate monuments like the Peace Cross for an establishment clause violation. 
The
Constitution commands that “Congress shall make no law respecting an
establishment of religion,” and this extends to the states through the 14th
Amendment. 
To
determine whether a government action runs afoul of this prohibition, the
Supreme Court has developed a number of tests that look for “excessive
entanglement” of government with religion, an endorsement or disparagement of a
particular faith tradition, or government coercion, while also weighing the
history and context of the challenged religious practice or display. 
The
Supreme Court has applied these tests inconsistently, however, giving the lower
courts little guidance about how and when to apply them. Last year, Justice Clarence
Thomas wrote that the Supreme Court’s “establishment clause jurisprudence is
in disarray.” 
When the
justices agreed to hear the Peace Cross case, many scholars hoped the Supreme
Court would provide some clarity. But after 70 minutes of oral argument, a clear
answer did not emerge. 
Carvin,
representing the American Legion, argued that the Supreme Court should adopt a
test looking for coercion or proselytization. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg asked
how that would be different from the protection offered by the free exercise clause.
Carvin responded that being forced “to pay three pence to a minister wouldn’t
violate free exercise … but it would violate the establishment clause.” 
Kagan and
Gorsuch both wanted to know what proselytizing is, and how it’s different from
the current endorsement test. Carvin explained that proselytizing is the
government preaching and trying to convert citizens, such as by conditioning
access to government services on religious beliefs. Under this theory, a symbol
like the Peace Cross would be “presumptively constitutional” unless the
government was seeking to convert citizens to a particular religion. 
Katyal argued
that the Peace Cross is constitutional under any of the existing tests, and he
pointed to its longevity (it stood for 86 years without any question of its
constitutionality) and secular purpose as reasons the Supreme Court should
uphold it. 
Wall pointed to the particular significance of the cross in memorializing those who died in World War I. He maintained that the Supreme Court should consider the historical understanding of the establishment clause: to prohibit government coercion of religious belief or practice. The Founders did not seek to prohibit acknowledgement or accommodation of religion in the public sphere, so the justices should ask whether a monument like the Peace Cross poses the type of dangers the Founders were concerned about.
Miller maintained that the establishment clause “prohibits the government from preferring one religion over another,” and said there are roughly 20 different factors for the Supreme Court to consider. Roberts balked at that, saying, “There must be something more concise.” 
5. Should the Supreme Court Overrule the Lemon Test? 
Gorsuch brought up the unworkable multi-factor Lemon test (named for the Supreme Court’s decision in Lemon v. Kurtzman) that Justice Antonin Scalia once compared to a “ghoul in a late-night horror movie that repeatedly sits up in its grave and shuffles abroad after being repeatedly killed and buried.” 
Gorsuch
pointed out that the Supreme Court hasn’t used this test in years, although the
lower courts continue to use it and sorely need guidance on this point. He
asked Miller if the justices should officially retire this “dog’s breakfast” of
a test. In response, she urged the Supreme Court not to overturn Lemon, arguing
that it can be very useful. 
Justice
Brett Kavanaugh retorted, “How can it be useful when we haven’t used it in the
most important cases that are on point here? … The lower courts need some clarity.”

When Katyal returned to the podium for his rebuttal, Kavanaugh posed the same question. Katyal replied that the Peace Cross is constitutional under any of the tests previously employed by the Supreme Court and that it’s “unnecessary to overrule Lemon” in this case. Instead, the justices should “wait for a case where Lemon” is relevant.
6. What’s the Real-World Impact of This Case?
If the
Supreme Court rules that the Peace Cross is unconstitutional, it will put at
risk dozens of other monuments throughout the country. 
Alito
asked Miller, “What message does it send knocking down crosses across the
country?” She refused to answer, saying the Peace Cross could be moved to
private land. 
Sotomayor noted
that the Peace Cross is “falling apart and has to be fixed,” so why not move it
and then fix it up? Miller seemed unconcerned by the potential for damage to
the cross, saying that entire historic homes have been successfully moved. 
She also
argued that the other parties grossly exaggerated the number of other crosses
that could be affected by this case. 
Alito
rejoined, “Would you like us to write that … no other cross has to be torn down
… in the opinion?” Miller replied that the case was “ill-suited for sweeping
announcements.” 
The American Legion put the issue in
perspective in its brief to the Supreme Court: 
If a century-old war memorial that is only in government hands because of traffic safety considerations arising 40 years after it was built is unconstitutional, it is difficult to conceive of any cross-shaped monument that will survive.
What to Expect
Based on
how the oral argument went, it’s clear that a number of the justices are
concerned about the broader impact a decision in this case could have. It could
take months for them to sort through those questions, determine which test to
use, and come to a consensus. But it seems likely that a majority of the
justices will vote to uphold the Peace Cross. 
The
Supreme Court will likely issue its opinion by the end of June, when the
current term ends. 
It’s
important to keep in mind that the Constitution does not mandate a “wall
of separation between church and state,” as Thomas Jefferson once wrote in a
private letter. Using the symbol of the cross to honor those who gave their
lives defending our nation and our freedom is consistent with the Constitution,
and the Supreme Court should uphold this longstanding tradition.

"Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts arrives Thursday in the Senate chamber for impeachment trial proceedings at the U.S. Capitol. (Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty Images)
The House of Representatives has chosen members to
participate in the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, and they
have presented the articles of impeachment to the Senate. 
This is only the third impeachment trial of a president
in our nation’s history, with the others occurring in 1868 for Andrew Johnson
and 1999 for Bill Clinton.
Here are eight things you need to know as the Senate prepares to begin Trump’s impeachment trial. 
Senate President Pro Tempore Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, administered the oath Thursday to Chief Justice John Roberts, who will preside over the trial.
Roberts, in turn, administered the oath to all senators. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., announced that the trial itself will begin at 1 p.m. Tuesday. 
The Clinton impeachment took five weeks, and Johnson’s lasted 11 weeks. The Senate’s impeachment trial rules, adopted in 1986, mandate that the trial should begin at noon and last until the Senate decides to adjourn, Monday through Saturday, “until final judgment shall be rendered.” 
An
impeachment trial is not like a run-of-the-mill trial, but it does have some
similarities. House managers will act as the prosecution, presenting the case
for impeachment to the senators, whose role is a combination of judge and jury.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announced the seven members of the House who will serve as the managers, including Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y.
A team of lawyers will put on the president’s defense, including White House counsel Pat Cipollone; Trump’s personal attorney, Jay Sekulow; and former independent counsel Ken Starr, whose investigation into the Whitewater controversy led to Clinton’s impeachment. 
Roberts will preside over the trial, consistent with Article 3, Section 6 of the Constitution, although it is mostly a ceremonial role. 
After presiding over Clinton’s impeachment trial, then-Chief Justice William Rehnquist said, “I took a leaf out of [Gilbert and Sullivan’s comic opera] ‘Iolanthe’ … ‘I did nothing in particular, and did it very well.’”
When the trial begins, the Senate will adopt a resolution establishing the specific timetable, including the time allotted for each side to present its case, senators to ask questions, and the Senate to consider motions. 
At that
point, if the Senate follows the general pattern of the Clinton trial, the
Senate will vote on a motion to dismiss the impeachment and, if that motion
fails, on whether additional witnesses or evidence should be considered. 
During
Johnson’s impeachment trial, the prosecution and defense called a total of 41
witnesses. During the Clinton trial, three witnesses provided videotaped testimony.

McConnell and several other Senate Republicans have indicated they think the Senate should rely on transcripts of the testimony of witnesses who appeared before the House, while Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and several other Democrats have demanded that witnesses be called to testify.  
No. While
the Senate does issue a summons to the individual being tried, its impeachment
trial rules allow for an appearance by the defendant or by his attorney. 
The
Senate tried, unsuccessfully, to force Johnson to appear for his impeachment
trial. The New York Times published
an account of how Chief Justice Salmon Chase asked the Senate sergeant-at-arms
to summon the president. 
“In a
loud voice, and amid the stillness of the whole chamber, he called three times,
‘Andrew Johnson, Andrew Johnson, Andrew Johnson!’” but instead the president’s
legal team, including Attorney General Henry Stanbery (who
resigned the day before) and former Supreme Court Justice Benjamin Curtis,
arrived. 
Clinton likewise did not appear before the Senate during his trial. 
Trump previously indicated he would “strongly consider” testifying or providing a written statement to the House during its impeachment inquiry, but that didn’t happen. Odds are, Trump won’t be present at the Senate trial. 
Senators are not required to employ a specific standard of proof. During the 1986 impeachment trial of U.S. District Judge Harry E. Claiborne, he made a motion to designate “beyond a reasonable doubt”—the standard in criminal trials—as the standard for his trial. 
After
the presiding officer ruled that “the question of standard of evidence is for
each senator to decide individually,” the Senate voted 75 to 17 against
establishing a mandatory standard.
Similarly, the rules of evidence used in criminal trials do not apply in an impeachment trial. The Senate’s impeachment trial rules state that the Senate’s presiding officer has the authority to rule on questions of evidence. 
Any senator, however, may ask that the full Senate vote on such matters. That reflects the Constitution’s assignment to the Senate of “the sole Power to try all Impeachments.” 
Senators
have taken an oath to “do impartial justice, according to the Constitution and
laws” in all things pertaining to the impeachment trial. 
Sen.
Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the minority whip, argued
that some senators have already failed to meet the “independent and dignified”
standard the Constitution envisioned. 
There
have already
been calls for the House managers to move to disqualify senators whose
impartiality is in question. There is no basis in the Constitution, Senate
rules, or history for such an attempt. 
The only qualification for participating in a Senate impeachment trial is to be a senator. 
While
the trial itself will be open to the public, the Senate’s deliberations after
its conclusion will not be.
The Senate will then come back into public session to vote on each article of impeachment. Senate impeachment trial rules say that the Senate must vote on each article in its entirety, and the Constitution requires the vote of “two-thirds of the [senators] present” for conviction.  
Removal
from office is automatic upon conviction, and the Senate may vote separately
whether to disqualify the defendant from serving in any other federal office.
The Constitution explicitly provides, however, that these consequences by the Senate do not, if the defendant’s conduct is also criminal, prevent “Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.”  
In theory, he likely could be retried in the future. Although neither the Constitution nor Senate rules address this issue, and no precedent exists for it, a few legal scholars, such as former Obama administration official Neal Katyal, have pointed out that the Fifth Amendment Double Jeopardy Clause does not apply to impeachment proceedings.  
A retrial on the same charges, however, would seem highly unlikely, and such a retrial would certainly run counter to the general principle of double jeopardy that someone cannot be tried twice for the same offense.  
What is more plausible and likely is that the House would introduce new articles of impeachment, which it could do.  
Senate committees may hold hearings in the morning of
each trial day, but doing any business such as sending bills, nominations, or
other matters to the full Senate would require the consent of all senators. 
The Senate impeachment rules provide that the chamber
must suspend its legislative and executive business while the trial is under
way. 
The trial should not affect the Supreme Court’s oral argument schedule. The court has arguments scheduled Tuesday and Wednesday, but those will conclude by 11 a.m. 
The
court won’t meet again for arguments until Feb. 24. Aside from taking up some
of Roberts’ time in the afternoon, the trial is unlikely to otherwise affect the
court.

"New York City’s regulations banned residents from taking their lawfully owned and registered handguns anywhere outside their homes except to one of seven gun ranges within city limits. (Photo: Stock/Getty Images)

Elizabeth Slattery writes about the proper role of the courts, judicial nominations, and the Constitution as a legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation. Read her research. She hosts SCOTUS101, a podcast about everything that’s happening at the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court
heard oral argument Monday in the first major case involving gun rights in
nearly a decade. A local shooting club is challenging New York City’s handgun
regulations, perhaps the most restrictive and draconian in the nation.
New York’s
regulations banned residents from taking their lawfully owned and registered
handguns anywhere outside their homes except to one of seven gun ranges within
city limits. The city prohibited residents from transporting their handguns to
ranges outside the city or to any other location, including a resident’s second
home. 
The Supreme Court
agreed to hear this case in January and added it to the 2019-2020 calendar that
began in October. In the intervening months, the city revised its regulations,
allowing gun owners to transport their handguns to ranges outside the city as
well as to second homes.
This course change
came after six years in which the city defended its prior regime as
constitutional. The city then suggested the justices dismiss the case as
“moot,” but the Supreme Court proceeded with oral argument. 
It was a packed house as gun control advocates protested on the plaza outside the court. Inside, former U.S. Solicitor General Paul Clement argued on behalf of the shooting club and shared time with Jeffrey Wall, the second-highest lawyer in the Solicitor General’s Office. Richard Dearing, a lawyer with New York City’s legal department, defended the regulations. 
Although some justices
peppered the three lawyers with questions, Justices Clarence Thomas and Brett
Kavanaugh remained silent. Chief Justice John Roberts asked New York’s lawyer questions
only about the issue of mootness. 
Here are four key exchanges from the argument in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. City of New York: 
1. Is This a Live Case or Controversy? 
The Constitution
limits judicial review to live “cases” or “controversies,” which means judges
may not issue “advisory opinions” on hypothetical matters. In order for a case
or controversy to be “live,” a court must be able to grant some relief to the
complaining party.
Justices Ruth
Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor seized on this immediately. New York argues
that it has given the shooting club members everything they want, leading
Ginsburg to ask: “What’s left of this case?”
Sotomayor
asserted, “You are asking us to take a case where the other side has thrown in
the towel.” 
But as Roberts wrote in a 2007 opinion, under the doctrine of voluntary cessation a defendant does not “moot” a case by willingly stopping the action that gave rise to litigation unless it is “absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.”
Otherwise, the
government could change its laws or regulations at the 11th hour and prevent
the Supreme Court from ruling. Justice Neil Gorsuch called the city to task,
saying it took “herculean, late-breaking efforts to moot” the case. 
On behalf of the
shooting club members, Clement explained that they seek a declaration that the
transportation ban is and was unconstitutional, to prevent the city from
reversing course in the future. 
Clement pointed out that the new regulations (which require “continuous and uninterrupted transport”) also pose issues—would members violate the new regulations if they stopped at a coffee shop or rest stop on the way to a shooting range outside the city? For this reason, he argued, the case is not moot. 
2. What Happens If the Case Is Moot?
If a majority of justices
is persuaded that the case is moot, several other Second Amendment cases are waiting
in the wings. The justices could agree to take up another case and hear oral
argument in the spring. 
A quick search of
the Supreme Court’s docket, for example, turned up Worman v. Healey, challenging
Massachusetts’ ban on firearms and magazines that are commonly used in more
than 40 states; Mance v. Barr, challenging the federal law criminalizing
interstate handgun sales; and Rogers v. Grewal and Gould v. Morgan, challenging
Massachusetts’ and New Jersey’s requirements that concealed-carry permit
applicants show a “good reason” or “justifiable need” (aside from self-defense)
for carrying a handgun outside the home. 
Undoubtedly, scores of other cases are winding through the district and appeals courts across the country.  
3. Does NYC’s Law Advance Public Safety?
Ginsburg balked at
the city’s suggestion that under the prior regulations, residents with a second
home should simply buy a second gun and leave it unattended. 
“What public
safety or any other reasonable end is served by [having one gun] in a place
that is often unoccupied and … more vulnerable to theft?” she asked. 
On behalf of the
city, Dearing struggled to find an answer, noting that historically there have
been “incidental burdens” similar to this. 
Justice Stephen
Breyer asked whether the change in regulation had affected public safety (the
city’s rationale for its original regime). Dearing answered that the police
commissioner determined that the ban on transporting handguns “could be
repealed without a negative impact on public safety.”
Justice Samuel
Alito followed up: “So you think the Second Amendment permits the imposition of
a restriction that has no public safety benefit?” 
Dearing again
appealed to history, saying that the focus should be on “how the restriction
accords with history under the Second Amendment.” 
This led to a discussion of the heart of the case—whether the Second Amendment protects a right that extends beyond the home.  
4. How Far Does the Second Amendment Extend?
When it decided
landmark Second Amendment cases in 2008 and 2010, the Supreme Court left for
another day the issue of whether the right extends beyond the home. 
Alito asked
Dearing, the city’s lawyer, whether he concedes that the Constitution protects
“possession of a firearm outside the home under at least some circumstances.” 
Dearing replied:
“The Second Amendment has something to say about what effective possession in
the home means. And sometimes that may mean that you need to be able to …
undertake certain activities outside the home.” 
That basically
gives the case away, if the justices reach the merits. 
But after an hour
of argument, it’s unclear whether a majority of the justices thinks the case is
moot. Based on their questions (which do not always reflect how a justice ultimately
will vote), Gorsuch and Alito think the court should reach the merits, while
Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Breyer think the case is moot. 
Preferring to play
it close to the vest, Roberts asked only a few questions. 
Whether or not the justices end up ruling on the merits, it likely is only a matter of time before the Supreme Court takes up another gun rights case. 
The lower courts could use guidance from the Supreme Court about the scope of the Second Amendment—including what standard of review courts should use to judge restrictions on gun rights; what types of firearms, ammunition, and magazines states may prohibit; and whether states may require concealed-carry permit applicants to show a “good cause” before obtaining a permit.  
In any event, this Supreme Court term is not short on blockbusters. Other cases involve abortion, the Trump administration’s attempt to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, and whether federal law prohibiting sex discrimination covers claims of discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.
Like those cases, the
Supreme Court’s ruling in the New York handgun case likely will come by the end
of June.

The Supreme Court will return Monday for oral arguments in what is shaping up to be a blockbuster term.
During the high court’s two-week December sitting, the justices will hear arguments in some important cases, including ones regarding the Second Amendment and Obamacare.  
The justices already have heard arguments in a case involving the Trump administration’s attempt to end the Obama administration’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and another on whether federal law prohibiting sex discrimination covers claims of discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation. 
Later in the term, the Supreme Court also will consider cases involving school choice, abortion, and the president’s ability to fire the head of an “independent” agency. 
The justices may decide to hear a challenge to the House Oversight and Reform Committee’s attempt to subpoena President Donald Trump’s tax records. 
New York City’s Restrictive Gun
Regulations
The Supreme Court will hear oral
arguments Monday in New York State
Rifle & Pistol Association v. City of New York, its first major case
involving the Second Amendment in nearly a decade. 
In District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) and McDonald v. City of Chicago (2010), the court ruled that the Second Amendment is not a collective right enjoyed only by state militias, but an individual right that applies to both the federal government and the states. 
Up until now, the court has turned down many
opportunities to hear cases raising related issues, such as what standard of
review courts should use to judge restrictions on gun rights; what types of firearms, ammunition, and magazines states may prohibit;
and whether states may require applicants for a concealed carry permit to show
a “good cause” or “justifiable need” before obtaining a permit.  
>>> Read more about cases the Supreme Court will hear in
2020.
The case to be argued Monday involves New York
City’s ban on the transportation of licensed
handguns anywhere within city limits except to gun ranges. The city required residents
to obtain a “premises license” in order to possess a handgun in their home or
transport it to one of seven gun ranges. 
Under these regulations, residents were not permitted
to transport a licensed handgun outside the city. 
Not surprisingly, members of a local
shooting club challenged these restrictions. They argued that the restrictions
fail any level of scrutiny under the Constitution, burden the fundamental right
to travel, and violate the Constitution’s commerce clause by controlling
economic activity beyond the city’s borders. 
District and appellate courts both ruled
in favor of the city. Once the Supreme Court granted review of the case, however,
New York City amended the regulations to allow residents with a premises
license to transport their handguns to another residence within or outside the
city and to gun ranges outside the city. 
Now the city argues that the case is moot
because the changes gave members of the shooting club everything they sought in
the lawsuit. The members disagree, maintaining that the case is not moot
because the Supreme Court still could rule that the original transport ban was
unconstitutional. 
Such a ruling would prevent the city from
changing course in the future. 
The New York case does not present the justices with the opportunity to rule on broader issues that have percolated in the lower courts since the Heller and McDonald decisions. Nevertheless, the fact that the justices will hear the case is a step in the right direction, hopefully providing lower courts guidance they sorely need. 
$12
Billion Obamacare Bait and Switch
On Dec. 10, the justices will hear three consolidated cases stemming from
the Patient Protection and Affordable Care
Act, popularly known as Obamacare. 
The cases challenge the federal government’s
failure to reimburse health insurance providers for losses they incurred by offering
insurance coverage, consistent with the Affordable Care Act, to those who previously
were uninsured or had preexisting conditions. 
The consolidated cases are Maine Community Health Options v. United
States; Moda Health Plan, Inc. v. United States; and Land of Lincoln Mutual
Health v. United States.
In passing the Affordable Care Act
in 2010, Congress set up a program to incentivize insurers to offer coverage to
people considered “risky” from an insurance perspective. The program required insurers
to pay a portion of any savings into it if their costs were lower than
expected, and the government would reimburse insurers for a portion of their
losses for three years if costs were higher than expected. 
After insurers began offering insurance
plans on the new health insurance exchanges under Obamacare, Congress used
appropriations riders to effectively defund the program for fiscal years 2015,
2016, and 2017. 
Insurers paid roughly $482 million into
the program from 2014 to 2016. Following the formula Congress came up with, the
government owed insurers nearly $12 billion.
As a result of the dramatically higher
costs, 18 of 24 insurers went out of business and several others stopped offering
coverage through the insurance exchanges. This led to skyrocketing costs, less
competition, and fewer coverage options. 
Several insurers sued the government for
damages, arguing that it had breached an implied contract and violated the
statute. The lower court ruled that through the appropriations riders, Congress
had impliedly repealed the Obamacare provision setting up the program and that
the statute lacked the language necessary to bind the government in a contract.
At the Supreme Court, the insurers argue
that the government’s roughly $12 billion bait and switch will endanger
public-private partnerships in the future if the government can induce massive
reliance by private parties and then fail to hold up its end of the bargain. 
They also point out that Congress did not
repeal the Obamacare provision setting up the program; instead, it limited the
source of funding, which did not eliminate the government’s financial
obligation. 
The government maintains that Congress did not create an entitlement that insurers are owed, but simply set up a program that would be “budget neutral”—entirely funded by insurers’ payments. The government also contends that a strong presumption exists against treating statutes like contracts, since statutes are inherently subject to change. 
This is the fifth case stemming from the Affordable
Care Act to reach the Supreme Court, and a sixth one may be on its way soon. 
The handgun and Obamacare cases are two
of the significant cases the Supreme Court will hear in December. The justices likely
will issue decisions in all of this term’s cases by the end of June.

"The day that racial
preferences are finally expunged from university admissions, hiring practices, and
contracting, we should all pause and quietly remember U.S. District Court Judge
Allison D. Burroughs. 
By deciding that
Harvard’s race-conscious admissions policies were not just constitutional, but
also a necessary evil on the road to colorblind nirvana, she rendered useful
service. 
Wittingly or not,
the judge has kicked the matter closer to the Supreme Court, where this heinous
practice will eventually be ended.
Burroughs based her decision on the tired and self-contradictory argument that all we need to do to fight discrimination is put up with more and more years of state-sanctioned discrimination until we get to the point when we don’t need it anymore. 
How long will Supreme Court justices hear this as the years go by until they realize that it would never end? 
Burroughs reached that conclusion Oct. 1 in a U.S. district court in Boston. Harvard’s “holistic” admissions policy, she ruled, does not violate the Constitution by giving blacks and Hispanics what the university terms a “plus factor” advantage denied to Asian Americans and whites.
A group of Asian American students, Students for Fair Admissions, had argued that the subjective personal criteria Harvard applies in its “holistic” admissions process unfairly penalized Asian Americans. 
For example, the university regularly rates Asian American applicants lower on criteria such as “leadership qualities” and “sense of humor.” In the objective academic measurements of grade point average and SAT scores, Asian American applicants surpassed members of all other racial and ethnic groups.
But Harvard does not “intentionally discriminate,” wrote the judge. Nor does it engage in impermissible racial balancing, she concluded, despite the fact that the admissions rate for Asian American applicants has stagnated at around 20% for many years. 
The university,
she wrote, is just pursuing a compelling interest in diversity, and “some
racial categorizations are necessary to serve that interest … .”
“A race-conscious admissions program allows Harvard to achieve a level of robust diversity that would not otherwise be possible, at least at this time,” Burroughs wrote.
It was here that
the judge began to wax poetic—literally, at one point quoting Toni Morrison. But
her decision contained some lyricism of her own, rhapsodizing that, “at least
for now, ensuring diversity at Harvard relies, in part, on race-conscious
admissions. … The students who are admitted to Harvard … will have the
opportunity to know and understand one another beyond race, as whole
individuals with unique histories and experiences.”  
She added: “It is
this, at Harvard and elsewhere, that will move us, one day, to the point where
we see that race is a fact, but not the defining fact and not the fact that
tells us what is important, but we are not there yet.”
This “temporary
solution,” however, has a long—albeit dubious—pedigree. In the 2003 Grutter v.
Bollinger decision that reaffirmed racial preferences, Justice Sandra Day
O’Connor suggested an expiration date: “It has been 25 years since Justice [Lewis]
Powell first approved the use of race to further an interest in student-body
diversity in the context of public higher education … . We expect that 25 years
from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further
the interest approved today.”
Interestingly,
Burroughs sought to kick the can down the road even further by writing this
week, “As time marches on and the effects of entrenched racism and unequal
opportunity remain obvious, this goal might be optimistic and may need to
change.”
O’Connor was referring
to Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, a fractured 1978 decision,
in which Powell wrote the controlling opinion. That decision gave colleges the
green light to implement race-conscious admissions programs. 
In a concurrence
that provided a fifth vote, Justice Harry Blackmun wrote, “In order to get
beyond racism, we must first take account of race. There is no other way. And
in order to treat some persons equally, we must treat them differently. We
cannot—we dare not—let the Equal Protection Clause perpetuate racial
supremacy.”
Decades later, in
a 2007 ruling, Chief Justice John Roberts advised instead that the way “to stop
discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of
race.” 
Harvard’s discriminatory program—which is hardly an outlier among Ivy League institutions—appears to be heading to the Supreme Court. Perhaps when it reaches the justices, they will see the harm caused by decades of government-sanctioned discrimination and decide it is long overdue to bring an end to this odious practice.

"The Supreme Court justices are faced with deciding whether it’s reasonable for the president to abandon an arguably unlawful program put in place by a predecessor. (Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)
The Supreme Court heard oral argument Tuesday in three cases challenging the Trump administration’s attempt to roll back the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
President Barack Obama had previously explained that
such a program was beyond the scope of the executive branch’s authority, saying
in an interview, “I’m not the emperor … My job is to
execute laws that are passed. And Congress right now has not changed what I
consider to be a broken immigration system.”
Nevertheless, the Obama administration went on to create
the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals  program in 2012, allowing about 700,000
illegal aliens who came to the United States as children to apply for work
authorization and deferred deportation. 
Fast-forward to 2017, the Trump-led Department of Homeland Security announced it would roll back the program that likely violated the constitutional separation of powers as well as federal immigration laws. 
As justification, it pointed to court rulings invalidating a related program for illegal alien parents of U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents.
The rollback decision drew immediate legal challenges
across the country, and three district courts ruled against the administration.

In the course of the litigation, then-Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen issued a memorandum more fully explaining the administration’s reasons for rolling back DACA, including that it is likely unlawful and also runs counter to the agency’s law enforcement priorities. 
Now at the Supreme Court, the justices are faced with
deciding whether it’s reasonable for the president to abandon an arguably unlawful
program put in place by a predecessor. 
The Trump administration argues that federal law bars
review of agency enforcement decisions, such as the DACA rollback, that are
“committed to agency discretion by law.” But if the decision is reviewable, the
administration maintains that it was rational to abandon an unlawful program. 
The following are a few key exchanges from the oral
argument: 
Justice Elena Kagan asked why the underlying DACA policy would be reviewable by courts, but the rescission of that policy would not be. “Are you suggesting that there’s an asymmetry in what’s reviewable?” she asked U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco. 
He replied that neither “side is arguing that the
[Immigration and Nationality Act] somehow restricts our ability to enforce the
law. And it would be quite surprising if Congress were to pass a law that says
something is illegal and then tries to somehow restrict the government’s
ability from enforcing the laws that it passes.” 
In essence, the administration argued that DACA deviated from federal immigration laws and that its rollback would bring the government back into compliance with the law. 
2. How Strong Are DACA’s Reliance Interests?
Justice Samuel Alito asked about whether this action would
“remove certain benefits,” and Francisco explained that benefits expire “on
their own terms” because DACA did not actually confer any benefits.
Justice Neil Gorsuch wanted to know about how much DACA recipients relied on the program continuing—had the administration “adequately considered” these reliance interests?
Francisco asserted that “to the extent there are any reliance interests, they’re extremely limited.” The DACA program “was always meant to be a temporary stopgap measure that could be rescinded at any time, which is why it was only granted in two-year increments,” he explained. “So, I don’t think anybody could have reasonably assumed that DACA was going to remain in effect in perpetuity.” 
Justice Stephen Breyer asked about the reliance
interests of businesses employing DACA recipients. Francisco said Nielsen’s
memo “explicitly considered the[se] reliance interests” when making the
determination to roll back DACA. 
Further, Francisco pointed out that the other side “has
agreed that we could rescind DACA at any time if, at least in their view, we
did provide a little bit more detailed of an explanation. So, I think that is
foursquare against the notion that there are some significant reliance interest,
because all that they seem to be saying is, we have to write a few more words.”
Gorsuch asked Ted Olson, the lawyer representing DACA
recipients, about reliance interests and why the government’s rationale for
rolling back DACA was supposedly insufficient: “What good would another five
years of litigation over the adequacy of that explanation serve? … What more
would you have the government say about [the] reliance interests?” 
Olson responded that there wasn’t an administrative
record supporting the government’s determination.  
3. A Matter of Enforcement Priorities?
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg brought up the claim that DACA was simply prioritizing how to handle the estimated 11 million illegal aliens present in the country. 
“Don’t you have to set up some kind of categories?” she
asked, since the government “[doesn’t] have the resources, so you have to
prioritize. Everybody agrees you have to prioritize.” 
Francisco countered that DACA “goes far beyond simply
diverting resources to higher-priority targets,” and “it actively facilitates
violations of the law.”
Kagan said the Obama administration based its decision to implement DACA on the Immigration and Nationality Act’s “grant of broad discretion over national immigration enforcement policy.” 
Francisco replied that “the most that does is, it gives you the authority to set policies and priorities,” and that “there’s a big leap between that and saying that you can affirmatively facilitate violations of the [law] by hundreds of thousands of individuals to whom Congress has repeatedly declined a pathway to lawful status.”
Olson said the Obama administration’s decision was “responsive
to explicit congressional direction to … establish enforcement priorities.” He
added, “That’s what DACA was all about. It said it did not establish any status;
it did not provide any benefits. It articulated an enforcement priority.” 
4. What’s the Limiting Principle?
Gorsuch wanted to know what limiting principle the
challengers believe the court should adopt on whether to review this kind of agency
enforcement decision.
Olson suggested “it’s a composite of principles,” including “a categorical determination involving a substantial number of people.” 
But Gorsuch jumped in. “Let me just stop you there,
though, because, if it’s categorical, and a large number of people, I can think
of a lot of prosecutorial decisions involving drug cases, the treatment of
marijuana in … our society today under federal law… [that] affects lots of
people on a categorical basis every day,” he said. 
Olson explained that the government’s decision not to prosecute certain drug cases is “completely different,” because people who have set up businesses and relied on the government’s statements about not prosecuting marijuana cases “are not invited to participate in a program … to come forward” the way DACA recipients were. 
5. Does the Administration Believe DACA Is Illegal? And Does It Matter?
One of the points that the justices returned to
throughout the argument was the claim that the Department of Homeland Security felt
compelled to roll back DACA because it was illegal. 
The challengers maintain that this isn’t a sufficient
reason. 
Chief Justice John Roberts asked Michael Mongan, the solicitor general of California arguing on behalf of several states seeking to uphold DACA, “Is it enough … to say, look, ‘I’ve got a decision from the [lower court] that tells me [the other deferred deportation program] is illegal. It’s been affirmed by the Supreme Court by an equally divided vote. That’s enough for me to say we’re not going to [continue DACA]’?” 
Mongan replied, “It’s not enough … given the nature of
this program and the interests at stake, we don’t think that any genuine
statement of legal doubt or litigation risk would be adequate.” 
Kagan wanted to know what an adequate explanation would
look like. “What do you think they would have to do to be in the clear on
this?” she asked. Mongan asserted that the government should “at least have to
identify the particular grounds that they’re relying on” and take “ownership of
a discretionary choice to end this policy.”  
Francisco rebutted that claim, saying, “We own this. We both own the policy rationale set forth in Secretary Nielsen’s memorandum. Also, because we think this is not subject to judicial review at all, we own the legal judgment set forth in Secretary Nielsen’s memoranda … .”
“We do think that DACA is illegal and was justifiably … rescinded
on that basis,” he said.
After 80 minutes of oral argument, several of the
justices seemed concerned that there wasn’t much more the Trump administration
could offer to support the DACA rollback decision. 
A ruling for the challengers that simply required the
Department of Homeland Security to bulk up its legal and policy rationales for
rolling back DACA would likely lead to more years of litigation, as Gorsuch
pointed out. 
DACA was supposed to be a temporary fix to allow
Congress more time to consider the hotly debated issue of how to handle the
presence of illegal aliens in our country. But instead, Congress has not come
up with a solution. 
The Supreme Court should allow the Trump administration to roll back DACA and to set its own immigration enforcement priorities. Then, the ball will be back in Congress’ court.

Abigail Klose

Abigail Klose is a graduate of the Young Leaders Program at The Heritage Foundation.
The Supreme Court returns for oral arguments Monday in a term that already is shaping up to be an exciting one. 
The justices already have heard arguments in cases involving the insanity defense; whether Title VII’s prohibition on “sex” discrimination covers sexual orientation and gender identity-based discrimination; and the constitutionality of former President Barack Obama’s appointments to Puerto Rico’s Financial Oversight and Management Board. 
Looking forward
to the court’s November sitting, we can expect arguments in important cases dealing
with traffic stops and the Fourth Amendment and with the Obama-era Deferred
Action for Childhood Arrivals immigration program. 
Traffic Stops and the Fourth Amendment
On Nov. 4, the court
will hear oral arguments in Kansas v. Glover. 
The issue is
whether it’s reasonable for a police officer to assume that the person driving
a car is the registered owner and, when that person has a suspended license, make
a traffic stop based on that assumption. 
Douglas County,
Kansas, Sheriff’s Deputy Mark Mehrer ran the license plate of a pickup truck
and found that the registered owner, Charles Glover Jr., had his license revoked.

We don’t know why
Mehrer decided to check this plate in the first place. (Perhaps he was having a
slow day.) He then proceeded to conduct a traffic stop, which resulted in
Glover being charged with driving as a habitual violator. 
Glover filed a
motion to suppress the evidence obtained during the traffic stop, arguing that the
officer lacked reasonable suspicion to conduct the traffic stop. 
The state district court ruled in favor of Glover. The case eventually reached the Kansas Supreme Court, which held that the officer’s assumption alone did not establish reasonable suspicion of criminal activity in order to conduct a stop consistent with the Fourth Amendment. 
Now at the U.S.
Supreme Court, Kansas argues that the state court’s standard requires more than
reasonable suspicion, and in any event, brief investigative stops impose a
“minimal intrusion” on people. 
An officer can determine quickly upon pulling a vehicle over whether the driver is the registered owner. Glover maintains that increases in technology, such as license plate readers that can scan hundreds of license plates on the road in minutes, could lead to subjecting more and more law-abiding drivers to the stigmatizing experience of being pulled over.

Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program
The Supreme Court will hear arguments in three consolidated cases (Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of the University of California, Trump v. NAACP, and McAleenan v. Vidal) related to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program on Nov. 12. 
The DACA program was created during the Obama administration by the Department of Homeland Security, allowing illegal aliens who were 30 years old or younger and came to the United States as children to apply for work authorization and deferral of deportation. 
Then the Obama administration expanded the program by removing the age limit and created a related program, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans, for the parents of U.S. citizens who came to the country illegally. 
Twenty-six
states challenged DAPA and the DACA expansion, arguing that the programs
violated the Administrative Procedure Act’s requirement that substantive agency
rules go through public notice and comment. 
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit sided with the states. The case reached the Supreme Court in 2016, but Justice Antonin Scalia died while the case was pending. The eight-member court deadlocked, leaving the lower court ruling in place.
Fast-forward
to the Trump administration, and the Department of Homeland Security concluded
that DACA itself was unlawful and decided to roll back the program, while continuing
to process renewals for current DACA recipients for six more months. 
Not
surprisingly, that decision drew several legal challenges. District courts in
New York; Washington, D.C.; and California ordered the Trump administration to
stop implementing its rollback of the DACA program. 
Now
at the Supreme Court, the Trump administration argues that its decision to
reverse a program that it considers unlawful is rational, and that, in any
event, since the Administrative Procedure Act prohibits judicial review of
agency enforcement decisions, courts may not review its decision. 
DACA
recipients and several states that challenged the action contend that it’s not the
type of enforcement decision contemplated by the Administrative Procedure Act’s
bar on reviewability. They also maintain that the decision was based upon
racial animus and deprived recipients of due process.  
These
are just two of the important cases the Supreme Court will hear in November. Later
in the term, the justices will consider cases involving gun rights, abortion, school
choice, and more, making this a blockbuster term. 
The
court should issue decisions in all of these cases by the end of June.

"New York chose to abandon its law in an effort to stop the justices from ruling on whether the Second Amendment protects a particular scenario. (Photo: Woraphon Nusen/EyeEm/Getty Images)

It’s not often that the Supreme Court agrees to hear a Second Amendment case. It’s been nearly 10 years since the last one, despite numerous petitions asking the justices to review state and local government attempts to regulate away the right to keep and bear arms.
Last January, however, the justices agreed to review New York City’s draconian and restrictive regulations prohibiting residents from transporting licensed, locked, and unloaded handguns anywhere but one of seven gun ranges within city limits.
If you were fortunate enough to have a second home upstate, too bad. If you preferred a gun range across the bridge in New Jersey, tough luck.
Members of a local shooting club who challenged the regulations agreed to a lengthy briefing schedule after the Supreme Court granted review. This moved the case to the 2019-2020 term, giving the city time to revise its regulations in an effort to prevent the Supreme Court from ruling on its previous regime. 
The city reasoned that it gave the shooting club members everything they wanted so the case is now “moot.”
The Constitution bars courts from issuing “advisory opinions” on hypothetical cases. One of the things that moves a case from the hypothetical realm to the real world is a court’s ability to grant some relief to the complaining party. 
In New York’s view, the Supreme Court can’t grant any relief here, but the shooting club members disagree. They want a declaration that the old transportation ban is and was unconstitutional in order to prevent the city from reversing course in the future.
And under the Supreme Court’s doctrine of voluntary cessation, as Chief Justice John Roberts explained in a 2007 ruling, a defendant does not “moot” a case by willingly stopping the action that gave rise to the lawsuit unless it is “absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.”
Shooting club members also object to the revised regulations, which now allow residents to transport licensed, locked, and unloaded handguns to gun ranges outside the city or second homes, but stipulate that any trip must be “continuous and uninterrupted.”
At the oral argument Dec. 2, the justices probed New York’s lawyer about this point. They wanted to know if stopping for coffee would violate the regulations. How about a short detour to a relative’s house? The city’s pinkie-swear promise that it wouldn’t go after those types of offenders wasn’t satisfying.
It takes a long time for most cases to work their way from initial filing up to the Supreme Court, and the justices take roughly 70 cases out of 7,000 petitions filed annually. This case took six years to reach the high court. 
After six years of insisting that its regulations were both constitutional and necessary for public safety, it’s pretty clear what motivated the city’s 11th-hour change. Concerned about how the newly constituted Supreme Court might rule, the city chose to abandon its law in an effort to stop the justices from ruling on whether the Second Amendment protects a right that extends beyond the home.
The Supreme Court should not reward such skulduggery. To do so would send the message to localities, states, and even the federal government that they can thwart judicial review and avoid accountability under the Constitution. 
Let’s hope the justices see through this ploy and keep this case in its sights.

"The Supreme Court heard oral argument in Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue on Wednesday, Jan. 22. (Photo: Phil Roeder/Getty Images)

@EHSlattery

Elizabeth Slattery writes about the proper role of the courts, judicial nominations, and the Constitution as a legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation. Read her research. She hosts SCOTUS101, a podcast about everything that’s happening at the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court heard oral argument Wednesday in an important
case involving a Montana tax credit scholarship program that
provided scholarships for underprivileged kids to use at private schools. 
Initially, families could use scholarship funds at qualified religious schools, but the Montana Department of Revenue later implemented an administrative rule excluding religious schools, citing a provision in the state Constitution that bars state funds from aiding religious organizations.
Parents who relied
on the scholarship funds to send their kids to religious schools challenged the
administrative rule for violating the religion clauses of the U.S. Constitution
as well as the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause. 
The state’s highest court struck down the program in its entirety for violating the “no aid” provision in the state Constitution. Almost 40 states have similar provisions (sometimes called Blaine Amendments) that prohibit money from supporting “sectarian” schools. 
As Justice Clarence
Thomas explained in Mitchell
v. Helms (2000), “[I]t was an open secret that ‘sectarian’
was code for ‘Catholic.’” 
Now, the Supreme
Court has heard oral arguments in Espinoza
v. Montana Department of Revenue.
Dick Komer of the
Institute for Justice argued on behalf of the parents, and Jeffrey Wall of the Solicitor
General’s Office represented the United States, which shared argument time with
the parents. Adam Unikowsky, an experienced Supreme Court litigator, argued on behalf
of Montana. 
Here are five key exchanges from the argument. 
1. Do the parents have standing to bring this challenge?
Justice Ruth Bader
Ginsburg asked the first question, and she wanted to know why the parents have
standing to bring this lawsuit in the first place. 
In order to bring a
lawsuit, the complaining party must have an actual injury, and Ginsburg asked
if the case should have been brought by the religious schools or taxpayers who
donate to the scholarship program and then receive a modest tax credit, instead
of the parents. 
Komer explained that
the parents were the beneficiaries of the scholarship program. 
Then, Justice Elena
Kagan jumped in, asking, “[W]here is the harm in this case at this point?” She
pointed out that no one will be allowed to use the scholarship funds (whether at
secular or religious private schools), so where is the discrimination? 
Komer replied that the discrimination occurred when the Montana Supreme Court invalidated the program in its entirety. He said, “[Y]ou can’t let the remedy shield the discriminatory judgment,” which was “mistakenly believing that this Blaine Amendment and the application of it did not violate the federal Constitution.” 
>>> Listen to “SCOTUS 101,” a podcast with Elizabeth Slattery and friends bringing you up to speed on what’s happening at the Supreme Court.
Chief Justice John Roberts—back at the court after presiding over President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial until the early hours of the morning—returned to the issue when Wall stepped up to the lectern. 
Wall explained that taking away the scholarship funds is a clear injury, and the parents have been penalized for their free exercise rights—not the schools’ right. 
Wall said, “Everybody concedes that if all the parents in this program had wanted to choose secular schools, there’d be no basis for the state court’s ruling. The scholarship program would still exist.” 
2. Are states required to give money to religious schools?
Justice Sonia
Sotomayor asked if the parents believe the Constitution requires states to give
money to secular and religious private schools. 
Komer explained that
states can choose whether or not they want to set up voucher programs, tax
credit scholarships, or other school choice initiatives, but once they do, they
can’t discriminate between parents who want to use those funds at secular and
religious private schools. 
He noted that states are not required to create these types of initiatives in the first place, but “if they give to one, they must give to the other.” 
3. Will the court strike down all Blaine Amendments?
Sotomayor asked Wall
if all state Blaine Amendments are unconstitutional. She went on for some time
about “the long history of people [going back to the founding] who for
non-discriminatory reasons … have taken the position that the state should not
give money to religious institutions.” 
Roberts politely
interjected, “Perhaps you could comment, counsel?” 
Wall replied that what the founding era evidence actually shows is that forced support of churches was prohibited, and that’s different from denying a “generally available benefit … to an institution [or individual] based on its religious character.” 
4. Does eliminating the program eliminate the constitutional violation?
Justice Brett
Kavanaugh asked Unikowsky if it would be constitutional to allow scholarship
funds to be used at secular and Protestant schools but not Jewish, Catholic, or
any other religious schools. 
Unikowsky said the
“right lens to look at … is the establishment clause, which prohibits the state
… from distinguishing between one religion versus a different religion.” 
Kavanaugh followed up, asking why giving scholarships to use at secular schools but not at religious schools is not discrimination. Unikowsky said there’s a “principled objection to funding of religious institutions,” but also that “coercing people [to use funds at secular schools] is a penalty on religion” and to balance the interests, the Montana court “simply level[ed] down” and eliminated the scholarship program.  
He reiterated that the Montana Blaine Amendment is not based on “religious bigotry,” but Kavanaugh replied that these amendments were “certainly rooted in grotesque religious bigotry against Catholics. … That was the clear motivation for [Montana’s amendment.]”
5. How does this compare to other types of discrimination?
Justice Samuel Alito posed a hypothetical about a
scholarship program where most of the recipients ended up being black. Would it
be discrimination to strike the whole program down for that reason? 
Unikowsky agreed that would be discrimination, but responded
that race and religion are not “identical for all constitutional reasons.” 
Alito pointedly remarked, “Basically what you’re saying is, the difference between this and race
is, it’s permissible to discriminate on the basis of religion. It’s not
permissible, ever, to discriminate on the basis of race.”
Wall addressed this issue in his opening, saying, “If the Montana Supreme Court had invalidated this program because it included historically African American schools or all-girls schools, that would be a straightforward equal protection violation. Nothing about it would be cured by the fact that other parents had been denied funding as well.”
After
an hour of argument, several justices, including Kavanaugh, Alito, and Roberts,
appeared to be troubled by Montana’s arguments while Sotomayor, Ginsburg, and
Kagan seemed unsure about whether the parents had standing to bring the lawsuit
in the first place. 
The
justices should issue their ruling in this case by the end of June when the
2019-2020 term wraps up. 
Looking Ahead
This
term is shaping up to be a significant one, and the court has already heard cases
involving the Second Amendment, Obamacare, and whether federal law covers
claims of discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation. 
Later in the spring, the justices will take up cases looking at the president’s ability to fire the head of an “independent” agency, regulation of abortion providers, a dispute over a subpoena for Trump’s financial records, and the Little Sisters of the Poor, who are still seeking relief from the Obama-era contraceptive mandate.

The Supreme Court, returning this week
for the beginning of its 2019-2020 term, heard oral argument Tuesday in three cases
asking it to decide whether the definition of sex in U.S. law includes sexual
orientation and gender identity. 
At issue is the meaning of the word “sex”
in Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the primary federal law prohibiting
discrimination in employment.
The cases were brought by a gay child welfare services coordinator and a gay skydiving instructor in the first argument, and, in the second argument, a male funeral home director who was fired after announcing he was transitioning to become a woman.
A packed house was promised outside the Supreme Court building, where people began lining up Friday for public seating. And inside the courtroom was just as busy, with five lawyers appearing before the justices. 
Pamela Karlan, a professor at Stanford Law School, argued on behalf of the gay employees in Bostock v. Clayton County and Altitude Express v. Zarda. Jeffrey Harris, a lawyer with the firm Consovoy McCarthy, made his Supreme Court debut representing the employers in Bostock and Zarda. 
David Cole of the American Civil Liberties Union represented the transgender employee, while John Bursch of Alliance Defending Freedom argued for the person’s employer in Harris Funeral Homes v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco shared time with the employers in both arguments.
Following a new rule announced last week by the high court, the
justices allowed each advocate to make a two-minute presentation before jumping
in with questions. 
Some common themes from the justices’ questions were what
“sex” meant in 1964, whether the court should act when Congress could amend the
law, and what this could mean for single-sex bathrooms, sports, and more. 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was the first to fire off a
question. She brought up the fact that when Congress passed Title VII as part
of the Civil Rights Act in 1964, it couldn’t have been in Congress’ mind that
discrimination “because of sex” meant discrimination based on sexual
orientation. 
Ginsburg underscored this point by noting that homosexuality
was at that time classified as a mental disorder, and many states criminalized
sodomy. 
Karlan admitted that is true—calling it the “days of ‘Mad Men,’” in a reference to the hit TV series—but said the court has interpreted Title VII to cover other things that weren’t within Congress’ mind, such as sexual harassment and sex stereotyping. 
When Harris took the lectern, he explained that sex and
sexual orientation are “independent and distinct characteristics,” and that Title
VII requires courts to compare similarly situated people for differential
treatment.
Francisco echoed this, saying that sex means “whether you’re male or female, not whether you’re gay or straight.” He argued that any doubt regarding the meaning of sex in Title VII “is removed by the history … and related statutes since.” 
Justice Samuel Alito noted that Congress has considered various proposals to amend Title VII and, in fact, the House of Representatives passed the Equality Act last spring. He asked whether the courts should leave this policy issue to the legislative branch. 
Karlan countered that a ruling that sex
discrimination includes sexual orientation would be no different from the
court’s earlier rulings finding male-on-male sexual harassment and sex
stereotyping were forms of sex discrimination. 
Chief Justice John Roberts pointed out that roughly two dozen states have passed laws prohibiting employment discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, and many have at the same time provided robust protections for religious liberty. 
Harris picked up on this point, noting
that Wisconsin was hailed as a civil rights pioneer when it passed a law
banning sexual orientation discrimination in employment in 1982. Such laws
would not have been necessary, he said, if Title VII’s ban on sex
discrimination already included sexual orientation and gender identity. 
Francisco also addressed this point,
saying that Congress is better suited to weigh the competing interests at stake
and address the need for religious or other exemptions. He suggested the Supreme
Court should not short-circuit the democratic process and instead allow
Congress to work out what changes, if any, the American people want to see in
Title VII.  
The justices spent a lot of time talking
about whether employees’ interpretation of Title VII would spell doom for
single-sex bathrooms, sex-specific dress codes, single-sex college sports teams,
and shelters for battered women. 
Title VII, after all, is a statute
promoting women’s equality, Bursch pointed out, and it allows employers to
acknowledge that there are differences between men and women. 
But the ACLU’s Cole tried to avoid answering these questions, eventually responding that one has to consider “not just whether [a single-sex or sex-specific policy] differentiates, but whether it differentiates in a way that injures,” and whether a reasonable person would experience “a significant or trivial harm.” 
 “Most instances, that’s not going to be a
significant harm,” Cole said, but when, for example, “you ask a transgender
person to dress in a way that is contrary to their sense of gender identity,
you have imposed a significant harm.” 
Karlan put it slightly differently,
explaining that you first look for people being treated differently based on
their sex, and then you ask if a reasonable person would be injured by that
differential treatment. 
Justice Neil Gorsuch wanted to know how one
decides what is “reasonable.” Karlan replied that an “idiosyncratic preference”
wouldn’t void a dress code or bathroom policy. 
Anyone hoping for clarity after the day’s argument was left wanting. After two hours of oral argument and dozens of questions, there was not much agreement among the justices. 
Justices Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan, and Sonia Sotomayor suggested several times that they think the text clearly favors the employees’ view. Alito and Roberts mentioned concerns about the court’s overstepping its boundaries.
 Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the high court’s newest justice, barely spoke at all. The justices will take the next several months to wrestle with the questions in these cases and likely issue rulings by the end of June.

In a column published at Law.com in December, one commentator argued that senators who refuse to be impartial should be disqualified from participating in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump. 
A few days ago, an ethics lawyer from the George W. Bush administration called Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., a “perjurer” for taking the oath to “do impartial justice” in the trial after saying he would not be an “impartial juror.” They might want to reconsider their position.
If these people really mean what they say, of course, any senator who has taken a position on the president’s guilt would have to bow out. 
In that case, say goodbye to Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif.  On Monday, Jan. 13, she spoke on the Senate floor and stated, as a fact, that Trump “pressured a foreign nation to interfere in our elections.” That’s an almost word-for-word recitation of the first impeachment article, which states that Trump “solicited the interference of a foreign government … in the 2020 United States presidential election.”
Harris went on to say that “it is unacceptable for a president to shake down a vulnerable foreign nation for personal or political benefit.” This too echoes the first impeachment article, which claims that Trump used the power of his office “to obtain an improper personal political benefit.”
If publicly accusing a defendant of the specific offense for which he has been impeached, in virtually identical language as that impeachment, is not refusing to be impartial, what is? Harris, however, is far from alone.
Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, who had rejected the presumption of innocence during the confirmation process for Justice Brett Kavanaugh, has said she would vote to convict unless Trump could actually exonerate himself. 
Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., says that the impeachment articles are supported by “a wealth of undisputed facts.” And Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., was even more direct, saying that the “case is clear: President Trump tried to trade away our national security for a personal political favor.” 
As if reading directly from the same talking points, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y.,  says that “President Trump put our national security at risk in order to obtain political favors.” And Sen. Christopher Murphy, D-Conn., insists that “the bottom line is this: President Trump abused his authority by using taxpayer-funded aid to pressure a foreign government to help him win reelection in 2020.”
Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., has similarly attacked McConnell, accusing him of refusing to be impartial. Yet, as CNN has reported, leading up to President Bill Clinton’s impeachment trial, Schumer repeatedly said that the Senate is “not like a jury box.” Indeed, when running for the Senate in 1998, he asked people to vote for him precisely because he would be a vote to acquit Clinton.
Impartiality, anyone?
House Democrats rigged the rules to guarantee a pre-determined impeachment result. Now Senate Democrats are trying to rig the jury pool by trying to exclude senators not likely to convict. We all know how this is going to end. Try the impeachment and let’s move on.

The Democrats’ case for impeaching President Donald Trump boils down to this: the accusation that he solicited, demanded, perhaps even coerced a foreign government to help him get reelected. Such behavior, they contend, constitutes an impeachable offense.
The most important task for the Senate when it conducts a trial on that article of impeachment is to determine whether that is, in fact, what Trump did.
This is not America’s first impeachment. In the past, however, the facts were clear; the challenge was deciding whether the individual’s actions fell within the Constitution’s category of “treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.” This time, before even reaching that issue, the question is what Trump actually did.
There seems to be agreement about this much: Trump briefly put aid to Ukraine, as well as a White House meeting with its new president, on hold.
In a July 25 phone conversation with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Trump urged the Ukrainian president to conduct two investigations. One focused on “this whole situation with Ukraine,” referring to accusations that Ukraine tried to influence the 2016 president election. He also spoke about whether former Vice President Joseph R. Biden “stopped the prosecution” of a company on whose board sat son Hunter Biden.
A month and a half later, the administration released the aid, even though Ukraine undertook neither of the investigations requested.
Nothing in that account, as far as it goes, amounts to an impeachable offense. The piece that makes or breaks the impeachment is the piece about which there is no evidence.
Democrats’ and their liberal allies have told us repeatedly just what that piece is. The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence report, for example, claims that Trump “solicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, to benefit his reelection.”
After releasing this report, Rep. Adam B. Schiff, California Democrat and Intelligence Committee chairman, spoke of a “scheme to coerce an ally into doing the president’s political dirty work.” Trump was guilty, he said, of using “official power to compel another country, Ukraine, to interfere in the 2020 election.”
Law professors testifying at the Dec. 4 House Judiciary Committee hearing said the same thing. Harvard professor Noah Feldman asserted that Trump “abused his office by soliciting the president of Ukraine to investigate his political rivals in order to gain personal political advantage, including in the 2020 presidential election.” Stanford professor Pamela Karlan claimed Trump “did this to strong-arm a foreign leader into smearing one of the president’s opponents in our ongoing election season.”
Believing something, even fervently, does not make it true. Repeating it, even endlessly, does not make it true. To make the charge stick, the impeachment inquiry must produce actual evidence for Trump’s specific, nefarious, impeachable intent to make Ukraine interfere in the 2020 presidential election. So far at least, it has failed to do so.
In the absence of actual evidence, Trump’s critics have presented arguments such as “I wouldn’t put it past him,” “that sounds like something Trump would do,” or “I just know in my gut.” Sentiments, however, are not evidence. Even theories that appear to fit the facts are not evidence.
The possibility that, if Ukraine had conducted those investigations, Trump could have used the results to help his reelection, is not evidence of his intent either. 
You might argue that it would have helped his chances. Then again, virtually everything a first-term president does could affect his reelection. If you believe that any president never chose what to do or how to do it with at least an eye (and possibly other senses as well) toward how it would affect his political standing, I have some oceanfront property in Utah to sell you.
How’s this for irony? On Nov. 13, as the Intelligence Committee’s first impeachment hearing opened, Schiff interrupted the Republican counsel’s questions to warn witnesses not to answer questions that “assume facts not in evidence.” With Schiff’s blessing, the House is about to impeach Trump by doing just that.

One of the Constitution’s clearest provisions is also one of its least-used: the process for removing the president for serious misconduct. Some politicians and lawyers, however, are trying to complicate this straightforward constitutional process, inventing things that simply aren’t there.
The Constitution’s impeachment process has two steps: Article 1, Section 2 gives the House of Representatives the “sole power of impeachment” and Section 3 gives the Senate the “sole power to try all impeachments.” 
The House did its part on Dec. 18, adopting two articles of impeachment. All that’s left is for the House to appoint a few members to act as the prosecutors and, as the Senate’s trial rules put it, notify the Senate that these impeachment “managers” are “directed to carry articles of impeachment to the Senate.”
If this sounds a little familiar, it’s not really different from the indictment and trial you might have watched on any episode of “Law & Order.” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif., however, appears to be making up a process of her own. She says she won’t appoint impeachment managers or send the articles to the Senate until the Senate agrees to conduct its trial the way she dictates.
In other words, Pelosi is holding the impeachment for ransom, keeping the county in impeachment limbo.
The House has impeached, but the Senate cannot conduct a trial unless it agrees to Pelosi’s demands or is able to change its impeachment trial rules (which requires a two-thirds vote) so it can at least start a trial on its own.
In response, Harvard law professor Noah Feldman, who argued strongly for impeachment as one of House Democrats’ hearing witnesses, wrote an article objecting to Pelosi’s gambit. President Donald Trump, Feldman insists, is not actually impeached until the House sends formal notice to the  Senate.
Feldman is wrong. He claims that, in the past, “‘impeachment’ occurred—and occurs—when the articles of impeachment are presented to the Senate for trial.” But asserting this is all he does. He offers nothing to suggest that America’s Founders designed impeachment this way. His claim actually contradicts the language of the Constitution. While the House has the “sole” power of impeachment, Feldman says that impeachment cannot occur without the Senate.
Feldman tries to blur the lines by saying that “impeachment is a process,” but that’s not really true either. Just like there is a process that results in an indictment, there is a process for producing an impeachment, a process that occurs entirely within the House of Representatives.
But an impeachment itself, like an indictment, is a thing. The Constitution, after all, gives the Senate the power to “try all impeachments.” The Senate’s impeachment trial rules refer to “managers of an impeachment” and their first trial responsibility as “exhibit[ing] articles of impeachment.” In other words, the articles of impeachment adopted by the House are the impeachment.
The House itself agrees. Its website includes a list of “individuals impeached by the House of Representatives.” The first name on the list is Sen. William Blount of Tennessee. The Senate literally refused to recognize the impeachment as valid, choosing instead to expel him. The House still says he was impeached. 
The list also includes U.S. District Judge Mark Delahay, who is listed as being impeached even though the House appointed no impeachment managers and the Senate conducted no trial at all.
Feldman’s claim is like saying that, though a grand jury has voted to indict, a criminal defendant is not really indicted until that action is presented to the trial jury.
To his credit, Feldman is correct that an indefinite delay in appointing managers and sending notice that they are ready to participate in the impeachment trial “would pose a serious problem.” 
The House impeachment process, and the impeachment itself, were purely partisan. Now that the impeachment is finished, however, trying to manipulate how the Senate conducts its trial would only taint this whole drama even more and further distort the Constitution’s impeachment framework.
Since Feldman is such a strong Trump critic, he likely came up with this novel theory to push the process ahead toward, he hopes, Senate conviction and Trump’s removal from office. His ends, however, do not justify his means.
The House has done its part by impeaching Trump. The House must appoint managers and notify the Senate not because doing so is necessary to complete the impeachment, but because it’s the House’s clear obligation under the Constitution.

The Constitution’s impeachment provisions are among the few that we would rather never be used. 
President Donald Trump is the 20th public official, and only the third president, to be impeached by the House of Representatives. 
Because the result of House impeachment, followed by conviction in a Senate trial, removes the president from office, however, it’s important to understand what conduct warrants such a significant interference in our election system.
When America’s Founders wrote the Constitution, they thought it necessary to provide for the possible removal of a president for serious misconduct, but had to find the right words to describe that misconduct. 
Words like “maladministration” were too broad, “treason and
bribery” too narrow. So they borrowed a phrase from English impeachment
practice and came up with what the Constitution says today: “Treason, Bribery,
or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.”
That phrase “other high Crimes and Misdemeanors” may still be a bit hazy to our 21st-century ears. What is most obvious, however, is that Congress cannot undo the last election anytime it wants by impeaching and removing the president for anything it wants.
This is a critical issue. The House has impeached Trump for what it calls “abuse of power” and “obstruction of Congress” and the Senate trial of that impeachment is now underway. 
Did the House choose a legitimate reason to impeach the president? How should the Senate evaluate the House’s impeachment and what decision should it make? 
On Jan. 22, a group of 21 state attorneys general released a 14-page letter offering their analysis of these issues. They looked not only at whether the facts supported the House impeachment, but also at the theory behind the impeachment. 
While the facts relate to this specific impeachment, the theory can be used in the future for other impeachments.
These attorneys general conclude that the first impeachment article, alleging “abuse of power,” really boils down to the claim that Trump took otherwise legal actions for a “corrupt purpose” or with a “corrupt motive.” 
In other words, his interaction with the government of Ukraine was not, by itself, improper at all. What transformed his actions into an impeachable offense was the supposed purpose of coercing Ukraine to interfere in the upcoming presidential election.
The attorneys general warn that impeaching a president not
for objectively improper actions but for his motive behind those actions
“encourages impeachment whenever the president exercises his constitutional
authority in a way that offends the opposing political party.”
This analysis also examines the motive behind the second impeachment article, which accuses Trump of “obstruction of Congress.” Here, the attorneys general explain that the separation of government powers into three branches means that each branch will guard its own power and prerogatives against demands by the others. 
When, for example, the president claims what is often called “executive privilege” to resist the demands of congressional committees, he is taking exactly the steps that America’s Founders anticipated.
So when the Trump administration refused to comply with subpoenas from House committees seeking witnesses and documents, the proper course would be for the House to enforce its subpoenas in court. The House did not do so.
 In fact, the attorneys general note, when John Bolton and Charles Kupperman asked a federal judge whether they must comply with subpoenas from the House Intelligence Committee, Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., actually withdrew the subpoenas altogether.
The upshot of the second impeachment article concludes this analysis, which is that House Democrats are trying to turn the normal interaction between the legislative and executive branches into an impeachable offense. 
“President Trump has thus been charged,” the attorneys general write, “with a ‘high crime or misdemeanor’ for doing what all presidents and top advisors routinely do—invoking executive privilege when Congress seeks to unconstitutionally interfere with the president’s high-level executive communications.”
This analysis is particularly valuable because it goes beyond the narrative about Trump’s telephone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and places this impeachment effort in a broader context to assess the impact it might have far beyond the events unfolding today.

"We need to reacquaint ourselves with this fundamental freedom.

We celebrate Thursday, Jan. 16, as Religious Freedom Day, the anniversary of the passage in 1786 of the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom. Unfortunately, the percentage of Americans who have heard of the law, or the day that commemorates it, is shockingly small.
Yet Thomas Jefferson, who authored the statute in the Virginia Legislature,
listed it on his tombstone as one of his three greatest achievements. 
We need to reacquaint ourselves with this fundamental freedom. 
President George H.W. Bush first declared Jan. 16 to be Religious
Freedom Day in 1993, and each president since has issued a proclamation on
religious liberty. In his first one, Bush noted that religious freedom is the
“first of all freedoms enumerated in our Bill of Rights.”
Bush and his successors as president all said that religious
freedom is of the highest importance: “integral to the preservation and
development of the United States” (Bush, 1993); a “fundamental human right … without
which a democracy cannot survive” (Bill Clinton, 1999); “one of this land’s
greatest blessings” (George W. Bush, 2009); a “universal and inalienable right”
(Barack Obama, 2017); and “innate to the dignity of every human person” (Donald
Trump, 2018).
All of those lofty phrases are true, as far as they go. 
But what is the “religious freedom” that presidents of both
parties have said is so important? Some have attempted to confine religious
freedom narrowly to religious “worship.” 
In his 2016 proclamation, for example, Obama referred to the
“freedom to worship as we choose.” Yet for Americans, religious freedom always has
been much broader than that. 
From long before America itself was born, this liberty was
referred to as the “exercise of religion.” That’s the phrase that America’s
founders used in the First Amendment.
In 2018, Trump framed religious freedom better by describing the “right
not just to believe as [Americans] see fit, but to freely exercise their
religion.” He called it the “right of the individual conscience and religious
exercise.”
In doing so, Trump echoed Clinton, who, in 2000, correctly
noted that the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom pledged that no one would
“suffer on account of his religious opinions or beliefs.” 
Properly understanding religious freedom in America requires fully appreciating both of these dimensions—the importance and the definition of religious freedom. And that understanding has never been more necessary than today. 
Clashes between the constitutional right to exercise
religion and civil or statutory rights, such as freedom from discrimination
based on controversial new categories, are multiplying all over the country.
Politicians and political interests are trying to reduce religious freedom to
nothing more than an ordinary value or preference and to confine it to personal
religious belief or, at most, to religious worship.
In other words, they want to excise religious exercise from
American life. Some take it even further, claiming that Americans who exercise
their faith are actually a danger, a negative element that should be minimized
or shut down entirely.
In 2018, for example, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., introduced
legislation, the Do No Harm Act, to exempt large categories of laws from the nation’s
Religious Freedom Restoration Act.
The Religious Freedom Restoration Act, signed into law in
1993 by Clinton, sets a tough standard for government actions, including
legislation, to interfere with the exercise of religion. Sen. Chuck Schumer,
D-N.Y., introduced the measure, which the House passed unanimously and the
Senate passed 97-3. 
By contrast, Harris’ legislation, co-sponsored by 31 other
Democrats, would exempt laws that relate directly to liberal constituencies,
such as labor unions or abortion providers. Neither Congress nor executive
branch agencies would have to consider at all the impact on religious freedom
of laws or regulations favoring those political interests.
This is a long way from the deep importance and broad definition that America’s Founders placed on religious freedom. It’s in stark contrast even to the most recent presidents’ rhetoric in their annual Religious Freedom Day proclamations. 
As a nation, we are at a crossroads and must decide whether
this freedom is what our presidents have said it is and, if so, commit again to
actions behind these words.

"The Religious Freedom Index got disappointing results in exploring “how Americans value religion and its role in society.” (Photo: Stock/Getty Images)

The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a leading nonprofit
law firm defending religious freedom, is taking an innovative approach to
evaluate the current state of religious freedom in America. 
Most assessments in this area focus on government actions
such as laws, regulations, or court decisions that affect religious freedom.
Becket’s first-ever Religious Freedom Index instead
focuses on public opinion, using a national poll to examine six dimensions of
religious freedom. The results are generally positive, with a few caveats.
At least formally, religious freedom in America long has
been defined broadly. The First Amendment, for example, refers to the “free exercise
of religion,” which obviously extends beyond speech or religious worship. In
fact, colonial laws protected the exercise of religion for more than a century
before the United States was born. 
In the mid-20th century, following World War II, the U.S.
was an original supporter of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Article
18 of that document says that religious freedom includes both belief and
behavior, in private and in public, individually and collectively.
But rights, even such fundamental and comprehensive ones,
are more than statements or ideas. To be real, they must be experienced and
that, in turn, depends a great deal on people’s understanding, perception,
support, or opposition to religious freedom. This is why, for example, the Pew
Research Center’s evaluation
of religious freedom around the world looks at social, as well as government,
hostilities involving religion. 
Becket’s Religious Freedom Index asked about the degree of
acceptance/support or challenge/opposition to six dimensions of religious
freedom. 
The index, for example, asked five questions about religious pluralism, such as practicing religion in daily life without fear of discrimination or harm. Overall, it shows an average of 80% support for religious pluralism.
Although there was little difference between Democrats and
Republicans regarding religious pluralism, the largest gap was about the
freedom to practice one’s religious beliefs “even if they are contrary to
accepted majority practices.” 
Significantly, however, Democrats led Republicans by 10 points
(85% to 75%). Future indexes will show whether this continues as the category
of “accepted majority practices” changes over time.
The Religious Freedom Index also explored “how Americans
value religion and its role in society.” The results were not as encouraging. 
“When it comes to issues and what happens today in our country,” for example, 56% said that religion is “part of the solution” while 44% said it is “part of the problem.” The division about “people of faith” was 59% to 41%. 
Problems, of course, need solutions. This perception by many (thankfully, not a majority) that not only religion in general, but people of faith in particular, are part of the problem may weaken support for the freedom to practice one’s religious beliefs even when those beliefs are contrary to majority practices.
The index also examined the familiar area of church and
state. Here, even though the U.S. Constitution explicitly prohibits any
“religious test for public office,” one-quarter of Americans say that candidates
“should be disqualified or blocked from holding public offices” based on their
religious beliefs. 
They also say that “[s]ociety should not tolerate public officials who might allow their religious beliefs to influence their decisions.” It will surprise many that the percent of religious people who say they believe this is exactly the same as the percent of agnostics and atheists.
The Religious Freedom Index is based on an online poll surveying a representative sample of 1,000 Americans age 18 and older. The margin of error was plus or minus 3.1%, and Heart and Mind Strategies constructed  the index.
Becket’s conclusion from this first Religious Freedom Index
is that “there is evidence for broad support of robust religious freedom
protections, discomfort with government interfering in religious practice, and
positive attitudes toward a culture of accommodation of religious practice.” 
The caveat, however, is this: “Within each dimension the
composition of support and opposition varies depending on political parties,
age, ethnicity and many other factors.” 
This means that the consensus supporting religious freedom
in America might be broad, but it also may not be very deep.

Democrats and Republicans have been fighting over whether the person who filed a complaint about President Donald Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy–sparking the impeachment inquiry now underway against Trump– should be called to testify publicly.
We believe the person, who is not technically a whistleblower, should be required to testify before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. 
Democrats who control the committee disagree. They killed a motion to subpoena the so-called whistleblower, who has said through his attorney that he wants to remain anonymous.
Here’s why the person filing the complaint should testify:
Impeaching and removing a president is perhaps the most consequential thing Congress can do, short of declaring war. Impeachment and removal turns our representative democracy on its head, nullifying the last election.
In the case of a first-term president, impeachment deprives the American people of the chance to pass judgment on his actions and decide if they want to reelect him.
Impeachment is designed to be a constitutional failsafe, a measure of last resort to save the republic from imminent harm posed by the executive.
Public understanding of such a grave step and confidence in its legitimacy demand that Democrats show that the impeachment proceedings now underway are more than simply an exercise of raw partisan politics.
The American people need to know as much as possible about what the president is accused of. Yet the impeachment inquiry against Trump has been marked by secret proceedings, rules favoring one party over the other, and explosive accusations by people who may not even have firsthand knowledge. These are not the marks of a legitimate process. Indeed, they actively undercut the people’s trust.
As then-Sen. Joe Biden said during President Bill Clinton’s impeachment in 1998: “We in Congress had better be very careful before we upset [the people’s] decision and make darn sure … that our decision to impeach him was based on principle and not politics.”
Biden, who went on to become vice president and is now seeking the Democratic nomination to challenge Trump for the presidency next year, was right 21 years ago and his position is the right one today. Not surprisingly, Democrats are far more eager to impeach Republican Trump than they were to impeach Democrat Clinton.
As the House moves toward what appears to be Trump’s likely impeachment (followed by his likely acquittal in a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate), Democrats will need to gather all the facts and present them openly and honestly to the American people.
That means that the complainant needs to answer important questions like:
How did you learn about the Trump-Zelenskyy call?
Did you have any firsthand information?
Who provided you with second-hand information?
Why did you think this person or persons were trustworthy?
Did the accounts you heard from those sources differ from the memorandum of the call released by the president?
Many more questions need to be asked, of course. 
The complainant’s attorneys have said he is willing to answer questions in writing, but that’s not sufficient. The American people need to weigh his credibility. Pieces of paper can’t answer questions.
And there are a lot of questions. As the intelligence community Inspector General noted, the complainant had significant ties to one of the current Democratic presidential candidates.
According to some media reports, the complainant is a registered Democrat who worked for then-Vice President Biden in addition to former CIA Director John Brennan and former national security adviser Susan Rice.
If any of these and other unverified reports about the so-called whistleblower are true, then there is good reason to think the complainant is more like a partisan double agent than a true whistleblower.
And especially because it appears the complainant lacked firsthand knowledge of the events he complained about, there’s the question of who did. And why did they seek him out to pass their information along?
Motive matters. If impeachment is to be anything other than a partisan assault on our democracy, a bipartisan consensus must agree that politics was not the animating factor behind the complaint as well as the subsequent impeachment inquiry.
Current House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., had some good advice back in 1998, when he was already serving in the House.
“There must never be a narrowly voted impeachment, when impeachment is supported by one of our major political parties and opposed by the other,” Nadler said 21 years ago.  “Such an impeachment will produce divisiveness and bitterness in our politics for years to come and will call into question the very legitimacy of our political institutions.”
Congress should heed that old but wise and very relevant advice of Joe Biden and Jerrold Nadler today.

"Speaker Nancy Pelosi unilaterally told six House committees to investigate without any rules or procedures. Pictured: Pelosi delivers closing remarks Nov. 1 at the Independence Dinner in Philadelphia. (Photo: Mark Makela/Getty Images)

Much of the attention on House Resolution 660, adopted by House Democrats on Halloween to advance the impeach of President Donald Trump, has failed to note the significant differences with resolutions authorizing previous presidential impeachments.
Two writers on the Lawfare blog, for example, claimed that HR 660 incorporates “a structure similar to what was in place for the Clinton and Nixon impeachment proceedings.” Simply placing the resolutions side by side shows this is false.
First, the previous resolutions authorized those impeachment inquiries at the outset; this one simply says “carry on” to committees that began investigating weeks ago.
Second, the previous resolutions authorized only the Judiciary Committee to investigate whether impeachment grounds exist. On Sept. 24, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi unilaterally told six different committees to investigate without any rules or procedures.
Third, HR 660 sets procedures for public hearings in only two of the six investigating committees. The others are named in the resolution but told simply to “continue their ongoing investigations as part of the existing House of Representatives inquiry.” This apparently means that the other four committees can continue operating in secret, using procedures they make up as they go along.
Fourth, the resolution creates a structure for subpoena authority in the Intelligence and Judiciary committees very different from what was in place for the Clinton and Nixon impeachments.
On Oct. 8, 1998, the House adopted HR 581, granting subpoena authority to “the chairman and ranking member acting jointly.” If “either declines to act,” the other may act alone after bringing the matter to the committee to decide “whether such authority shall be so exercised.” HR 803, adopted on Feb. 6, 1974, included the same provision for the Nixon impeachment.
The structure for subpoena authority in HR 660, however, is the opposite. It is not directed at both the majority and minority; in fact, it does not use the word “jointly” at all. Instead, the ranking minority member must have “the concurrence of the chair” to exercise subpoena authority, but not vice versa. If “the chair declines to concur,” the ranking minority member must bring the matter to the committee for decision.
In other words, the chairman can act unilaterally, while the minority always needs the majority’s permission.
Fifth, HR 581 explicitly said that, after committee approval, the ranking minority member can exercise subpoena authority “acting alone.” HR 660 deletes any mention of the ranking minority member actually exercising subpoena power, saying only that he or she may refer the matter to the committee.
As if this significant departure from past impeachment procedures were not enough, there are even more radical developments brewing in individual committees. While HR 660 presents the Intelligence Committee as taking the lead, the Judiciary Committee has made its own move. Chairman Jerry Nadler, a New York Democrat, has released the committee’s own impeachment hearing procedures “pursuant to House Resolution 660.”
These procedures appear to allow Trump’s counsel to attend and participate in any Judiciary Committee hearings. But there’s an enormous caveat. 
Section F states that Nadler can impose “appropriate remedies” if the president “unlawfully” refuses to make witnesses available or to produce requested documents for any of the six investigating committees. These remedies include “denying specific requests by the President or his counsel under these procedures to call or question witnesses.”
Remember that four of the six House investigating committees can continue operating in secret, under whatever rules or procedures they choose. That investigative scheme, in fact, can be entirely different for each of those committees.
Nadler claims the ability to determine when the president has acted “unlawfully” in relation to committees over which he has no authority. And, when he does (based on whatever standards or criteria he alone chooses), Nadler says he can bar the president—the impeachment defendant—from participating at all in the Judiciary Committee’s hearings.
Thankfully, the Constitution’s impeachment provisions have not been used often in American history. But we do know how to conduct a presidential impeachment that is genuinely fair, legitimate, and that minimizes partisanship. 
House Democrats have chosen to reject the example, counsel, and guidance of that experience and opted instead for a glaringly partisan, unbalanced, and novel process.

Thomas Jipping is deputy director of the Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies and senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation.
As House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., passed the impeachment inquiry baton to the Judiciary Committee this week, he said the central allegation against President Donald Trump is that the president “solicited foreign interference in the 2020 presidential election.”
This accusation will likely be the heart of any articles of impeachment the Judiciary Committee produces against the president.
If that’s the Democrats’ choice, so be it. But choices have consequences. If the Democrats go with solicitation, they’ll have to actually prove it.
As House Democrats have pursued an impeachment, they’ve turned to focus groups to find the phrases that will serve them best. This marketing research led them to drop the “quid pro quo” accusation.
It turns out most people realize a quid pro quo is nothing more than an exchange of one thing for another—something that happened this morning when I filled up my car at the gas station and I paid with my credit card.
As the focus group feedback rolled in, Schiff shifted to words like “bribery,” “extortion,” or “shake-down.” Perhaps Democrats have now settled on “solicitation” for the same reason.
While specific terms may resonate more or less among focus groups, some of them also have specific legal definitions. Under federal law (18 U.S. Code §373), for example, solicitation of a crime of violence requires not only a specific intent but also that the solicitation occurs “under circumstances strongly corroborative of that intent.”
The Justice Department’s Criminal Resource Manual explains that “the Government must establish that the defendant had the intent that another person engages in conduct constituting a felony crime of violence in violation of Federal law. The intent must be shown to be serious by strongly corroborative circumstances. Second, the Government must prove that the defendant commanded, induced, or otherwise endeavored to persuade the other person to commit the felony.”
The whole impeachment ballgame comes down to whether Trump took certain actions in relation to Ukraine for the specific purpose of manipulating the 2020 presidential election. 
The House Intelligence Committee’s report states as its first finding of fact, for example, that Trump “solicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.”
Law professors brought in for Wednesday’s Judiciary Committee hearing made the same claim. Harvard professor Noah Feldman claimed that in a July 25 telephone call, Trump urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy “to investigate his political rivals in order to gain personal political advantage, including in the 2020 presidential election.”
Stanford professor Pamela Karlan similarly claimed that Trump sought “the aid of a foreign government in his reelection campaign.” Trump, she said, literally demanded “foreign interference in our elections.”
No, an offense does not have to be criminal to be impeachable. But if Democrats are going to frame the case against Trump in terms of a recognized crime like solicitation and if they are going to claim that Trump acted with this intent, then they should have to prove it.
While Democrats have repeatedly claimed that Trump solicited foreign interference in the 2020 election, repeating a claim does not prove it.
It is obviously insufficient, for example, to speculate that if Zelenskyy had done what Trump asked (he did not), it could have resulted in something Trump might have used next year in his reelection campaign.
Legitimate reasons for Trump’s request to Zelenskyy unrelated to the 2020 election increase the need for concrete, actual evidence of the intent that Trump’s critics claim.
After all, everything a first-term president does has the potential to affect his reelection prospects. And every first-term president takes actions, or takes actions in a particular way, with an eye toward just that end.
The House Intelligence Committee hearings highlighted that Trump sometimes conducts foreign policy, including with respect to Ukraine, in ways that frustrate professional diplomats and Trump’s critics. OK, but is that evidence that Trump, in Feldman’s words, sought “personal political and electoral advantage over his political rival?”
In the Judiciary Committee hearing Wednesday, George Washington University professor Jonathan Turley distinguished between “rage and reason.”
Trump critics, both in and outside of government, have whipped each other into a frenzy that appears to be affecting their judgment, Turley said.
So far at least, they seem to be substituting “I wouldn’t put it past him” or “sounds like something Trump would do” for evidence that Trump acted with the intent required to establish what they say he did.

"The criminalization of a Halloween tradition for children doesn’t end at Virginia’s state border. (Photo: Stock/Getty Images)

Halloween is the spookiest night of the year, when millions
of monsters and supernatural creatures of the night (often accompanied by their
parents) stalk peaceful communities and extort candy from good people under
threats of mischief. 
These rambunctious ghouls and goblins are only looking for fun,
sweets, and a bit of playful fright. But there is something that should terrify
trick-or-treaters (and their parents) more than haunting ghosts, blood-thirsty vampires,
prowling werewolves, or even a jack-o’-lantern
in space: sinister city council members trying to hand out criminal convictions
like candy.
The City Council of Chesapeake, Virginia, has outlawed any child over the age of 14 from trick-or-treating under penalty of a misdemeanor conviction and fines up to $250. The council also mandated that trick-or-treating end sharply at 8 p.m. 
Last year, before the council revised the law, children 12 or older were forbidden to trick or treat under penalty of up to six months imprisonment.
Frighteningly, Chesapeake’s ordinance is one of the least
restrictive among cities in the Hampton Roads region of Virginia. In
addition to halting door-to-door fun at 8 p.m., Hampton, Newport News, Norfolk,
Portsmouth, Suffolk, Virginia Beach, Williamsburg, and others criminalize
trick-or-treating beyond the age of 12. 
Moreover, the criminalization of a tradition for children doesn’t
end at Virginia’s state border. Cities in Illinois
and Mississippi also prohibit anyone over the age of 12 from participating
in trick-or-treating activities.
Chesapeake and other cities such as Belleville, Illinois, have attempted to defend their ordinances by claiming that they never before have been enforced, but, according to Chesapeake’s website, “give police an option, should things get out of hand on Halloween.”
Chesapeake officials also point to an earlier occurrence, in the 1960s, where things did get “out of hand” because of some rowdy teenagers with fireworks. 
In defense of his city’s ordinance, Belleville
Mayor Mark Eckert claims that it addresses fears held by “young single
moms” and senior citizens of “big kids” in high school who have the ability to
act aggressively toward homes and homeowners. 
Nevertheless, the possibility of some older children acting
mischievously or even belligerently is no reason to criminalize the innocent
behavior of thousands of others.
Most kids simply want to collect candy and spend a festive
evening with friends and families, and other laws already prohibit breaking and
entering, vandalism, or assault for those who do get “out of hand.”
Creating new laws to punish otherwise blameless behavior serves
no legitimate government interest and contributes to the growing problem of
overcriminalization—the overuse and abuse of the criminal law to address every
societal problem and punish every mistake.
Heritage Foundation scholars have written extensively (see here,
here,
and here)
about overcriminalization, and, unfortunately, not even holidays like Halloween
are beyond its tentacles.
Laws that never have been enforced should not be kept around as potential safeguards against potentially bad behavior. 
Instead of feeding the wild beast of overcriminalization, as communities reflect on their Halloween and kids recover from their sugar highs, cities with ridiculous bans on trick-or-treating should rethink their priorities and help combat the rampant spread of the misuse of criminal law.

"The Supreme Court will hear a case challenging the constitutionality of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. (Photo: Saul/Loeb/AFP/Getty Images)

GianCarlo Canaparo

@GCanaparo

GianCarlo Canaparo is a legal fellow in the Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies at The Heritage Foundation.
The Supreme Court agreed Oct. 18 to
hear a case
challenging the constitutionality of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. 
The court will decide whether, by sharply
curtailing the president’s ability to remove the head of this executive branch
agency, Congress violated the Constitution’s separation of powers.
Congress created the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau in 2010 to regulate banks, securities firms, payday
lenders, and other financial companies providing services to consumers. 
It is unique among executive agencies
in that it has a single director whom the president cannot remove except “for
cause”—that is, “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or
malfeasance in office.” 
Seila Law, a California-based law
firm that helps people get rid of consumer debt, sued, arguing that that structure
violates the separation of powers because Congress gave the director a great
deal of executive power without making him accountable to the president. 
The appeal comes out of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, which upheld the consumer bureau’s structure, although it said Seila Law’s argument was “not without force.” The court nevertheless rejected Seila Law’s argument because “the for-cause removal restriction protecting the CFPB’s Director does not impede the President’s ability to perform his constitutional duty to ensure that the laws are faithfully executed.”
The U.S.
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the structure
of the bureau last year, when now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh was
still a judge on that court. 
In a forceful dissent, Kavanaugh wrote that “other than the President, the Director of the CFPB is the single most powerful official in the entire U.S. government, at least when measured in terms of unilateral power.” Kavanaugh explained that unlike other agency heads, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Director is “unaccountable to the president” and this “novel structure” violates the Constitution.
Although the consumer bureau defended
its structure in the lower courts, it has reversed its position in the Supreme
Court, arguing now that its structure is
unconstitutional. The agency asserts, however, that the court can solve the
problem by simply striking down the “for-cause” removal limitation, but
otherwise preserving the agency.
It may not get its way. The court is
at least considering whether to invalidate the entire agency.
In its order accepting the case, the court asked the parties to answer this question: If the for-cause removal requirement is unconstitutional, can it be severed from the rest of the statute that created the bureau? If it can’t be severed, then the court might invalidate the entire agency.  
Notably, in his D.C. Circuit dissent, Kavanaugh wrote that he believed the for-cause requirement could be struck down while preserving the rest of the agency. Whether he retains that opinion and whether his eight colleagues agree remain to be seen.
The case is important because it presents an opportunity for the court to defend the separation of powers. The court notably missed another opportunity to do so last term in Gundy v. United States, when it upheld a broad delegation of law-writing authority from Congress to the attorney general. 
It should not miss another
opportunity, particularly where, as in this case, even the agency itself
concedes that its structure violates the Constitution.
The case also affords the court the
opportunity to correct the damage caused by the bureau’s unconstitutional
structure. 
As The Heritage Foundation has discussed at length here, and then-law professor Neomi Rao, now a federal judge herself, testified here, the unconstitutional structure of the bureau has led to abuses of its power that have caused economic harm and undermined the rule of law.  
At the very least, therefore, the court
should invalidate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s decisions of the past
nine years because they’re products of an unconstitutional agency.
In the meantime, however, the court should
not miss this opportunity to tell Congress that when the Constitution says the
legislative, executive, and judicial powers shall be separate, it really means
it.

"“It’s pretty simple,” Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., tweeted last March, in calling for President Donald Trump’s impeachment. “No one is above the law, including the President of the United States.”
But perhaps Tlaib—among Trump’s harshest critics in Congress—needs to follow up with another tweet, in the interests of transparency. This tweet could read: “No one is above the law. Except me.”
According to a report issued last week by the House Ethics Committee, there is “substantial reason to believe” that Tlaib used campaign funds for personal expenditures, thereby violating both campaign finance laws and House ethics rules.
The alleged violations stem from $17,500 that her campaign paid her, apparently to cover personal expenses, after she was elected to Congress.
Text messages and emails between Tlaib and her campaign staff show that throughout her campaign she repeatedly asked her campaign for money to cover personal expenses like “car maintenance, child care, and other necessities.”
At one point, Tlaib asked her campaign to give her $2,000 every two weeks. Between May 7 and Nov. 16, 2018, it did so. Then, on Dec. 1, 2018, it paid her $15,500.
In total, Tlaib’s campaign gave her $45,000 over seven months.
Federal campaign finance law (52 U.S.C. §30114(b)) prohibits the use of campaign funds for personal use. The law, including the regulations promulgated by the Federal Election Commission, defines “personal use” very broadly.
Personal use includes any “commitment, obligation, or expense of a person that would exist irrespective of the candidate’s campaign duties.” That plainly includes car maintenance, child care, and “other necessities.”
Additionally, House ethics rules prohibit representatives from using campaign funds for personal expenditures. They and their staffs are tasked with ensuring that their campaigns operate in compliance with the law.
While candidates may take a salary from their campaigns, there are very strict limits on that. Among the litany of restrictions is this one: The salary can only be paid for work performed before the election. The salary has to end the day the candidate is either elected or withdraws from the race and is no longer a candidate.
Tlaib’s eligibility for a salary paid from her campaign funds ended on Nov. 6, 2018, when she was elected to the House of Representatives. Yet her campaign continued to pay her through the end of December. She collected $17,500 after the election.
Tlaib’s lawyers concede that the payments were made after Nov. 6 last year, but argue that the money was for services performed before the election. But according to the report, documents taken from her campaign “suggest otherwise.”
A spreadsheet of campaign salary payments shows that Tlaib’s campaign paid her $2,000 on Nov. 16 last year for work performed between Nov. 1 and 15. And according to that same spreadsheet, the $15,500 paid on Dec. 1 was for work performed between Nov. 16 and Dec. 31 last year.
Additionally, the checks confirm those dates, as do emails from Tlaib’s campaign treasurer. As to the $15,500 payment, her campaign treasurer’s records show that at least $8,000 of it was paid for work performed after the election, and the remaining $7,500 was an unspecified “adjustment.”
It certainly appears to be a clear violation of federal law. Perhaps it’s no surprise, then, that the best arguments her lawyers can come up with are that there was no “conscious disregard” of the law, and that it’s “most irregular” for the Office of Congressional Ethics to look into pre-election activities.
In other words, Tlaib should be excused because she didn’t bother to learn the law or because Congress should permit candidates to violate ethics laws with impunity until they get elected. It doesn’t take a lawyer to see how feeble these arguments are.
Given how bad this looks for Tlaib, it’s no surprise that she and her campaign staff refused all interview requests from the Office of Congressional Ethics.
And Tlaib’s problems extend beyond the Ethics Committee.
Both the Federal Election Commission and the U.S. Justice Department have jurisdiction over violations of federal campaign finance law. The FEC can force those who err to repay the money and impose a civil penalty – even where there was no “conscious disregard” of the law.
If Tlaib “knowingly and willfully” violated the law, that is a criminal violation that comes under the jurisdiction of the Justice Department. Criminal violations of the law can result not only in civil penalties, but prison time.
We agree with Tlaib that “no one is above the law.” Does she agree with her own tweet?

Who is Clarence Thomas? 
Every pundit has an opinion, but few actually know him.   
Now, we all have an opportunity to hear his story in his own voice. In a remarkable documentary by Michael and Gina Pack, “Created Equal: Clarence Thomas in His Own Words,” the famously silent justice tells his life story.  And not just the small part that everyone has an opinion about, but his whole, and wholly astonishing, story. 
As memories of the facts surrounding his contentious
confirmation battle—in which Anita Hill accused him of sexual harassment and
Thomas vigorously defended himself—have faded with time, public opinion has
shifted against Thomas.  
At the time of his confirmation, the public was twice
as likely to believe Thomas over Hill (55% to 27%), and 58% favored his
confirmation.  Today, only
30% of Americans believe that he should have been confirmed, and 38% say he
should not have been.
What accounts for these changing opinions? Mostly likely
it’s the relentless effort by Thomas’s critics over the last 28 years to tell his
story in their own terms.  They lost the
battle against his confirmation, but they’ve never stopped fighting the battle
over his life story.  Until now, Thomas
has largely preferred to stay out of the fight with the exception of publishing
his memoir, “My
Grandfather’s Son,” in 2007.
Like his memoir, the documentary follows Thomas’s journey
from poverty in rural Georgia to the Supreme Court.  Along the way, he lives through segregation, starts
upon and then leaves the path to the Catholic priesthood, joins the Black Power
movement, goes to Yale Law School, hesitantly joins the Republican Party, and
marries the woman he calls “a gift from God.”   
Thomas talks about growing up speaking Geechee—a Creole language spoken by the descendants of slaves in Georgia—before Standard English.  He relives his reactions to the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy, and explains how the prejudice of his fellow seminarians drove him from the church and into radical racial politics. 
He describes his slow turn away from those politics and tells
how he decided to vote for Ronald Reagan. 
And, in a particularly raw moment, he reveals that the racist attacks
leveled at him ever since his confirmation continue to create fresh wounds.
Perhaps what makes Thomas’s story most interesting is that it is as much about the people in Thomas’s life as it is about him. He recounts the ways—big and small—that others shaped his life.  From Sister Mary Virgilius, his eighth-grade teacher who wouldn’t let him waste his potential, to John Danforth, who as Missouri‘s attorney general gave Thomas his first job after law school when no one else would (despite his excellent grades). 
Hardly a moment goes by in the film when Thomas isn’t speaking about somebody else.
Most often, that person is Thomas’s grandfather who raised him until he later threw Thomas out of his house.  More than anything, the film is the story of how his grandfather shaped him, often against Thomas’s will, into the man he is today. Thomas’s grandfather was hardworking, fiercely independent, and strict.  He lived his life by biblical principles and the sweat of his brow, and he taught Thomas those lessons.  
His grandfather’s lessons weave through Thomas’s life as he learns, rebels against, and finally embraces them. Proverbs 22:6 seems to be the unifying theme to his story: “Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.”    
Perhaps, above all else, what makes Thomas’s story so
powerful is that it’s relatable.  More
than a rags-to-riches story, it’s the story of a person struggling to reconcile
his passions with his family values and the world around him.  
After all the noise and spin continually whipped up by
pundits about Thomas, it’s refreshing to hear the man himself tell his
story.  And what a story it is.

"In the you-just-can’t-make-this-stuff-up category, we interrupt the impeachment proceedings to return to the Jussie Smollett drama.  
The latest head scratcher is the fact that Smollett has filed a two-count counterclaim against the city of Chicago, claiming malicious prosecution. That’s right. 
Smollett is suing the city for malicious prosecution because he filed a bogus police report about a hate crime that didn’t happen, and in spite of the fact that Cook County prosecutor Kim Foxx let him off the hook for it. That’s gratitude for you.
Let’s unpack this Alice-in-Wonderland comedy.
A quick refresher on the facts
is helpful. Last January, Smollett says he received a letter at the television
studio where the show “Empire” is filmed, and the letter contained white
powder, had a stick figure hanging from a tree, with cutout letters saying,
“Smollett Jussie you will die black [expletive].”  
Smollett told an ABC News crew that the return address
on the letter said MAGA, a reference to the “Make America Great Again” Trump
moniker. That case was turned over to the FBI, but we don’t know what, if
anything, the feds have decided to do about that allegation.
A week later, Smollett claimed that while he was
walking home at 2 a.m., “two offenders who engaged in racial and homophobic
slurs” assaulted him, poured a liquid on him, put a rope around his neck, and
pulled him by the rope.  
According to a
lawsuit filed against him by the city of Chicago, Smollett
identified at least one of his attackers as a white man.
The allegations fell
apart quickly when the police investigated the case. It
turned out that Smollett’s alleged attackers were not white, but black. 
The men were two brothers from Nigeria whom Smollett
knew. He had paid them $3,500 for, what he called, “personal training,” but according
to the brothers, Smollett actually paid them to stage the
attack because he was unhappy that his previous attempt to stage a threat
against himself (with a fake letter) didn’t get him much attention.
Smollett was eventually indicted on
16 related disorderly conduct offenses for making up the entire affair. Foxx,
who was in charge of the office prosecuting Smollett, announced
that she would recuse herself from the case because she had conversations with
one of Smollett’s relatives about the investigation.  
Later, however, Foxx announced that she had not really recused herself, and she subsequently dropped all charges against Smollett. She gave him a sweetheart plea deal: He was allowed to walk away from the case without admitting guilt, he forfeited his $10,000 bond, he was given credit for 16 hours of community service, and his case was sealed. 
Chicago’s mayor-elect, Lori Lightfoot, supported the deal, saying, “This doesn’t rank as a matter of any importance to me.”
Others, us
included, thought that something wasn’t right about the plea
deal, and called for an investigation into this suspicious miscarriage of
justice. The Illinois Prosecutors Bar Association, for example, called it
“highly unusual” and not representative of the “honest ethical work”
prosecutors are supposed to provide on a daily basis.    
The city of Chicago then sought reimbursement for the
$130,106 it spent investigating the hoax. When Smollett refused to pony up the
money, they sued him in federal court.  
Smollett’s attorneys tried to get the case tossed out,
but U.S. District Court Judge Virginia Kendall said last month, “This will be going
forward.” The next hearing in federal court is Feb. 18, 2020.  
Meanwhile, in Illinois state court, a Cook County
judge appointed a special prosecutor to look into the entire fiasco, including
how and why the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office came to offer Smollett
the deal of the century.  
Smollett got off a lot easier than he should have, but his counterclaim against Chicago shows he’s committed to pretending that he was the victim in this docudrama.  
Smollett was booted
from the last season of “Empire” as a result of his false allegations. This may
be the only drama he can star in, for now.

"Nothing proved Attorney General William Barr's point quite as well as the barrage of spite and vitriol that the left hurled at him for this speech. (Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)

Rarely does a U.S. attorney general get such blowback for a non-televised speech at a university. Yet that’s what happened to Attorney General William Barr.
On Oct. 11, Barr gave a
speech at Notre Dame Law School that began with the unremarkable
observation that “[f]rom the Founding Era onward, there was a strong consensus
about the centrality of religious liberty in the United States.”
By the time he finished that speech, left-wing writers were
pounding their keyboards with hair-on-fire indignation. Here’s what Barr said
that got them so worked up.
The founding generation’s view of human nature “was drawn
from the classical Christian tradition,” which is essential to our system of
government. That system, he explained, enshrines and defends individual liberty
and, therefore, has little ability to rein in “the unbridled pursuit of
personal appetites at the expense of the common good.”
For that reason, he continued, the Framers placed their
trust in “the self-discipline and virtue of the American people,” and relied on
religion to provide those virtues. It does so by helping to “teach, train, and
habituate people to want what is good.”
Barr continued by pointing out the growing effort to replace
the Judeo-Christian moral system with “secularism and the doctrine of moral
relativism.” Traditional religious values are not decaying, he said, but rather
are the target of “organized destruction.”
He argued that secularists have attacked religion and those who hold religious beliefs with “social, educational, and professional ostracism,” lawsuits, and social media campaigns. Those who practice their faith publicly are shamed or sued into submission, while those who hold their beliefs privately are encouraged to keep their beliefs quiet under threats of public censure or ridicule.
The law, he argued, has been used to subdue religious expression
and to force religious people to participate in practices antithetical to their
faith. 
President Barack Obama’s administration, for example, sued
to force religious employers to provide abortifacient coverage in health plans.
Meanwhile, states have passed laws requiring public schools to adopt LGBT advocacy
curricula that are inconsistent with traditional Christian teaching and have
made it illegal for parents to take their children out of those classes.
This is not “live and let live,” Barr argued, but rather an
effort to “[compel] people to violate their conscience.” 
While he called for people to emphasize “the moral education
of our children,” he recognized that “[t]he times are hostile to this.”
Nothing proved that point quite as well as the barrage of
spite and vitriol that the left hurled at Barr for this speech. The response in
left-wing media outlets was astonishing, both for its reluctance to engage with
Barr’s arguments and its willingness to throw invective at him instead.
The Chicago Tribune, for example, ran
a piece accusing Barr of telling atheists to “go to hell.” Of course, Barr
said no such thing. The New York Times’ reliably temperate Paul
Krugman said that we should all be scared of Barr’s speech because “it’s
the language of witch hunts and pogroms.”
Yet another writer
declared that Barr’s speech made him feel “not just uncomfortable” but “disturbed.”
Clutching his pearls, he wondered how Barr could even mention Judeo-Christian
morals working for “such an unprincipled, morally bankrupt, fornicating,
mendacious president.”
But the most amusing display of foot-stomping histrionics
came from The
New Yorker, which threw at Barr nearly every adjective its thick-prosed know-it-alls
could pull out of Webster.  
Not only was it “the worst speech by an attorney general of
the United States in modern history,” it was “historically illiterate,”
“morally obtuse,” “willfully misleading,” “vague,” “obscure,” “galling,” and
“potted.”  
Potted? 
Never mind. Let’s see if Barr’s speech really deserved the
Chicken Little hysteria it received.
Michael Farris, writing
in The Hill, has already shown that Barr’s speech lined up with bipartisan
sentiments in the 1990s when President Bill Clinton signed the Religious
Freedom Restoration Act into law. So let’s go further back and compare Barr’s
sentiments to the Founders’.  
Is Barr’s vision of religion’s role in America really the potted
pogrom his critics say it is? 
It doesn’t seem like it. On the contrary, it echoes the
Founders’ understanding that religion was paramount to the health and longevity
of the union. 
In his Farewell Address,
George Washington noted that “morality is a necessary spring of popular
government,” and that morality cannot exist without religion. 
John Adams said, “Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.”  
The list of similar quotations from other Founders is long
and uniform in this sentiment. The Founders all came from similar Christian
traditions and recognized that those values were essential for a government
that afforded its people enormous freedom. 
It’s for that reason that the First Amendment protects
religious freedom from government meddling by declaring: “Congress shall make
no law respecting an establishment of religion.”
That’s not to say that each individual Founder was deeply
pious. Some were not at all. But still they recognized what Barr reiterated:
that the Christian tradition encourages a needed and irreplaceable morality in
the people. 
Modern-day secularists might like to erase religion’s
central role in our history, just as they’d like to drive religious viewpoints
from the public square today. But they should instead see the value that
religion brings and embrace the freedom of religious people to practice their
faith free from government coercion.
Barr did that in his speech, and his Justice Department is
putting his words into action.
Undermining his critics’ claim that Barr cares only about
Christians, Barr’s Justice Department continues to defend the religious
liberties of Muslims,
Christians,
Jews,
practitioners
of Native American religions, and
more. This effort is not only constitutional, but also praiseworthy.  
At the end of the day, what Barr did was provide historical
background to the First Amendment’s first guarantee, and affirm our
responsibility to stand up for it. That’s hardly something to get upset about.

Politics is like mud wrestling. No one comes out clean.
And as recent
comments by Senior Judge Paul Friedman of the U.S. District Court for the
District of Columbia show, that holds especially true for judges. 
Friedman jumped into the political mud pit on Wednesday to wrestle President Donald Trump, saying that Trump’s criticism of judges who rule against him feeds into a “destructive narrative” and that Trump’s criticisms have only gotten worse over time.
Friedman has a point, but he does more harm than good in making it. Yes, some of Trump’s criticisms of judges have been too hot, but Friedman accomplishes nothing by entering the fray.  
On the contrary, he only contributes to the increasing
perception among the American people that judges are just politicians
hiding their partisan agendas behind black robes.
No institution has more to lose by being covered in political muck than the judiciary. Impartiality and the appearance of it are paramount to the judiciary’s integrity. 
The Code of Conduct for United States Judges hammers that theme home. It explains that public confidence in the judiciary’s impartiality is indispensable to justice. And when the judiciary loses the public’s confidence, it “injures our system of government under law.”
For that reason, the code forbids judges from engaging in political activities.  
In fact, the code prohibits a lot of behavior that non-judges take for granted: serving on the board of a public company, accepting certain gifts, participating in political organizations, making speeches for or against politicians, donating to political causes, engaging in “any other political activity,” and more.
Judges don’t even have the luxury of setting their
personal priorities as “[t]he duties of judicial office take precedence over
all other activities.” 
Judges are judges first, individuals second, and aren’t
supposed to do anything that “detract[s] from the dignity of the judge’s
office” or “reflect[s] adversely on the judge’s impartiality.”
It’s a monastic calling, and it should be. 
The integrity of our system of government rests on every
judge’s shoulders. Every judge is an ambassador for a judiciary whose effectiveness
depends on its ability to preserve untarnished in the minds of the American
people the ideal of Lady Justice.
Judges succeed as Lady Justice’s ambassadors the way courthouse
columns succeed at holding up a classical entablature: By upholding the rule of
law “without fear or favor.”
Friedman, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton,
seems to have forgotten the code. That’s understandable, because judges are
people, after all, with all the same passions as the rest of us, which are
easily inflamed in these hyperpartisan times. But it’s still not excusable.    
Anyway, what good can Friedman do the judiciary by entering the political fray? Can he stop the president from attacking judges? Certainly not.  
Can he reassure the public that the judiciary is above the fray? Not while he’s standing in it.  
Judges’ perceived impartiality depends on them staying above the fray. It defies human nature to let an attack go unanswered, but judges have to. More than their pride is at stake.
That’s not to say the judiciary is without a defense for political attacks. Others, especially lawyers, teachers, and civic-minded citizens, should come to their defense when warranted. 
Judges can also preempt political attacks by teaching people about the value of the separation of powers and an independent judiciary.
But when judges enter the political mud pit, even for good reason, they just get mud on their robes.

The New York Times
on Oct. 4 reported that a second intelligence official “alarmed by President [Donald]
Trump’s dealings with Ukraine” is considering whether to file a complaint with
the intelligence community inspector general.
Like the first whistleblower,
however, this individual is apparently trying to advance his agenda outside of
the process provided by federal law.
As we have detailed, the first whistleblower began with the office of Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act, however, prohibits that direct contact, requiring instead that complaints follow a process that begins with the intelligence community inspector general.
In like fashion, this second individual, who claims to have firsthand information regarding Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has chosen to talk to the media through his or her lawyer, rather than file a complaint.
According to the lawyer, this
person has firsthand knowledge of some of the allegations included in the first complaint
and has spoken to the inspector general.
Until this official files a complaint and it’s made public, we have no idea whether his or her account will, as the media have reported, bolster the secondhand and thirdhand information recounted in the first complaint. Until we see his or her complaint and the information actually detailed in it, the information the media report that his lawyer told them is still secondhand.
Naturally, that hasn’t
stopped the media from calling this a “firsthand” account and speculating
wildly about its impact on Democrats’ impeachment efforts. The New York Times,
for example, claims that it “would potentially add further credibility to the
account of the first whistleblower.”
There’s that word again:
“whistleblower.” 
The media often use it, but all we know is that the second person has something to say that his or her lawyer has shared with the media. How does that make him or her a “whistleblower”? For that matter, is the first person a whistleblower?
Let’s start with the law that protects intelligence officials who blow the whistle. The key provision of the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act is codified in Title 50 of the U.S. Code Section 3033.  
The law does not define or even use the term “whistleblower,” except in the title, but it does clearly identify the people it’s designed to protect.
To be covered by the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act, a would-be whistleblower must (1) be an employee of the intelligence community or of an intelligence community contractor, (2) who intends to report to Congress a complaint or information, (3) with respect to an urgent concern, and (4) who follows the disclosure procedures set forth in the act.
The act defines “urgent
concern” as a problem, abuse, or deficiency relating to “an intelligence
activity within the responsibility of the Director of National Intelligence.”
That’s the most concrete way we have of defining a “whistleblower.” Those criteria show that this second person is not a whistleblower at all.  
For one thing, we have no evidence corroborating the lawyer’s assertion that his client is an intelligence official. For another, there is no indication that he or she intends to submit a complaint to Congress. 
As far as we know, he or she hasn’t even submitted a complaint to the inspector general or otherwise followed any of the act’s disclosure procedures.
The first so-called whistleblower, doesn’t match the statutory description either.
The subject of his or her complaint, the Trump-Zelenskyy phone call, does not meet the statutory definition of “urgent concern.” As the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel explained, the Trump-Zelenskyy call did not involve “an intelligence activity within the responsibility of the Director of National Intelligence.”
On the contrary, it
explained, the call was “a confidential diplomatic communication between the president
and a foreign leader that the intelligence-community complainant received
secondhand.”
What’s more, the first “complainant,” as the Justice Department rightly calls him or her, violated the law’s disclosure procedures and even might have broken the law in going straight to Schiff’s staff.
To many people, the term “whistleblower”
brings to mind a well-meaning, honest person who, possibly at personal risk or
cost, selflessly comes forward with evidence of wrongdoing. It’s a meaningful
term. 
But this exercise in political spin, which applies “whistleblower” to people who are not, undermines legitimate efforts to expose wrongdoing.  
These individuals are more like political double agents hiding behind the act, their lawyers, and a friendly press to snipe at a president they don’t like while cloaking themselves with the mantle of reluctant and dutiful public servants. 
We’re not buying it.

North Carolina is taking its overcriminalization
problem seriously.  
With overwhelming bipartisan support, the state last month
enacted Senate
Bill 584, which allows the legislature to rein in runaway
regulatory crimes.
Like the federal government, North Carolina’s regulatory
agencies are overzealously creating regulatory crimes. These are crimes defined
by executive branch agencies pursuant to authority delegated to them by the
legislature.  
Most criminal regulations do not cover things we typically consider “criminal” like murder or burglary. Instead, they’re things like providing criminal penalties for violating complex rules for selling bedding or transferring money. 
Such activities may seem less serious than traditional
crimes, but they can result in equally serious jail time.
As Heritage Foundation scholars have said time
and time
again, regulatory crimes are a problem. It’s all but impossible for the public
to know them all, and yet, as the maxim goes, ignorance of the law is no
excuse. You will pay a fine and may go to jail if you accidentally mislabel
bedding.  
In the case of the federal government, experts
estimate that there are more than 300,000 regulatory offenses carrying
potential criminal penalties. Americans have been sent
to prison for breaking laws they didn’t even know existed and which did not
involve inherently blameworthy conduct.
Taking note of this problem, North Carolina passed a law in
2018 that required state and local agencies to report to the legislature all of
their rules that carried criminal penalties. Many agencies failed to comply,
and so, last month, the state enacted SB 584.
Section 3 of the law sets a new compliance deadline, and Section
5 adds a penalty for noncompliance: Any agency that fails to report to the
legislature in a timely manner loses its power to enforce new criminal rules for
two years.
Additionally, Section 6 automatically refers all new criminal
regulations proposed by state agencies to the legislature’s General Statutes
Commission, which will then review them and make recommendations to the general
session whether any of the regulations should have their criminal penalties
removed.
The law is an excellent first step to getting a handle on
runaway regulatory crimes. North Carolina has correctly recognized that
regulatory crimes are a problem, that to address that problem it must take inventory
of its regulatory crimes, and that the legislature should retain its authority
to review and vote on all crimes that the state creates.
The federal government should follow North Carolina’s
example.
For years, The Heritage Foundation has supported efforts to
count the federal criminal laws contained both in the United States Code and in
the Code of Federal Regulations. The Department of Justice and several
non-governmental organizations have tried, and failed, to do so.
But who better than to count criminal regulations than the
agencies that promulgated them? And what better way to encourage that effort
than to forbid agencies from enforcing new crimes if they don’t comply?  
After all, if an agency is unable to count the crimes it has
created, it cannot be trusted to enforce more.
Congress should put aside political differences and rally in
support of a federal law mirroring SB 584. 
North Carolina’s law passed the Republican-majority state legislature
with overwhelming
bipartisan support and was signed by its Democratic governor.  
This is an issue that people on both sides of the aisle
can—and often do—agree on. A federal law that requires executive agencies to
count their criminal rules wouldn’t just be good policy, it would be a much-needed
win for bipartisanship.

"In a 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals case, prosecutors charge the defendants with bank fraud, even though they didn’t commit bank fraud.

In an opinion issued on Aug. 5, the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals struck a small but valuable blow against prosecutorial overreach and the problem of overcriminalization.
By now, overcriminalization—the overuse and abuse of criminal laws to address every societal concern and punish every mistake—is a familiar problem. 
There are
hundreds of thousands of federal crimes, creating a minefield of criminal
liability that Americans unknowingly walk through every day.
The federal criminal
code and the hundreds of thousands of criminal statutes contained in federal
regulations criminalize things such as making an annoying noise in a national park, allowing a horse to exceed a “slow walk”
when people nearby are on foot, and using a surfboard
on a beach designated for swimming.
No less serious
than the problem of criminalizing all sorts of innocent behavior is the problem
posed by overzealous prosecutors who stretch the law to obtain as many criminal
convictions as possible.
As The Heritage Foundation’s Paul Larkin writes, overzealous prosecutors “might not acknowledge or even recognize instances of overcriminalization, and even if they did, they might not highlight them, because doing so would embarrass the attorney general and individual U.S. attorneys who had the authority to prevent any such prosecutions.”
In the 6th Circuit case, prosecutors charged the defendants with bank fraud, even though they didn’t commit bank fraud. The defendants did commit mortgage fraud, but the government didn’t prosecute them for that. 
In fact, for
reasons unknown, the prosecutors ignored that crime for five years until the
statute of limitations expired.  
Then, realizing that their delay cost them a mortgage fraud conviction, the prosecutors searched the criminal code for some law that might let them prosecute the defendants anyway. They settled on bank fraud, even though the defendants’ crime didn’t fit the bill. 
But the court refused to expand the law because the bank fraud statute “is as straightforward as they come” and plainly did not cover mortgage fraud. It ordered that the defendants be acquitted.
That was the
right outcome. 
You might counter, “The defendants were guilty of something. Surely they should go to jail, regardless of the prosecutors’ mistake.” But that flips due process on its head, allowing the government to lock people up whenever—and for whatever—it wants.
Prosecutors
already have tremendous power, and the fewer tethers it has, the more unjust
its use becomes.  
Consider the case
of Eddie Leroy Anderson and his son. 
Prosecutors charged them with federal felonies for looking for
arrowheads on federal land. Although they found no arrowheads, prosecutors
argued that the mere act of looking for them was an attempt to violate an
obscure law that the father and son didn’t know existed.  
Facing felony
convictions and prison terms, Anderson and his son pleaded guilty to lesser
charges.
In another case, prosecutors charged a fisherman with
destruction of “tangible objects” in violation of a law designed to prevent
financial companies from destroying records of fraudulent activities. 
The Supreme Court
reversed the fisherman’s conviction and held that although fish are, strictly
speaking, tangible objects, prosecuting the fisherman for throwing fish back
into the sea was an impermissible expansion of a law designed to target
financial crimes.
In each of these
cases, prosecutors zealously sought a conviction, but never stopped to ask if
they were doing justice.
The 6th Circuit deserves praise for overturning the convictions of Amir Babak Banyan and Bryan Puckett in Tennessee.
In so doing, the
court reminded the prosecutors that liberty is best protected by interpreting
criminal statutes narrowly and putting the burden squarely on the government to
apply the right laws to the right crimes.
Prosecutors would
do well to remember U.S. Supreme Court Justice George Sutherland’s admonition in a 1935 ruling that although a prosecutor “may strike
hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul ones.”

When criminal laws are created to “solve” every problem, punish every mistake, and compel the “right” behaviors, this troubling trend is known as overcriminalization. Ultimately, it leads to injustice for honest, hard-working Americans at every level of society.
Public interest groups from across the political spectrum recognize how this flood of criminal laws violates our basic liberties. Diverse organizations including the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Association of Criminal Defense Attorneys, the American Center for Law and Justice, and Right on Crime, among others, have joined with Heritage to reaffirm the true purpose of America’s justice system: to ensure public safety and protect the innocent.
When was the last time you saw the ACLU work together with a faith-based group like Justice Fellowship? With USA vs. YOU, the problem is grave enough to bring together unlikely allies. And we’re delivering this bipartisan message just as the House of Representatives has launched a task force aimed at correcting this issue.
This morning, Heritage Senior Legal Fellow John Malcolm will testify at the first hearing of the Overcriminalization Task Force—shining a spotlight on the scope and severity of this threat to our liberties. Ending the practice of trapping our citizens with unnecessary laws will be no easy task, with an estimated 4,500 criminal law offenses and 300,000 criminal regulations on the books.

"""We have tough battles here, but they are winnable to the extent that we will follow the word of God,"" Pastor Jim Garlow says. (Photo courtesy of Josh Shepherd)
Seated in the House gallery, one man watched the vote on the Conscience Protection Act with all the intensity of a general going into war.
On July 13, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the bill, which intended to protect the rights of health care providers, churches, and other groups that object to participating in abortion.
Jim Garlow, father of eight children and pastor of Skyline Wesleyan Church in San Diego, California, sat with his wife and a dozen congregants who prayed and discussed events unfolding on the House floor. While others visit the nation’s capital city for summer vacation, this team came with purpose.
Nearly two years ago, Garlow was thrust into a battle with the state of California when his church objected to a new state mandate involving abortion. Since then, he has found that pro-choice bias in state and federal government is no casual affair.
“They are ruthless,” Garlow says.
Yet his church refuses to bow to the state. Represented by Alliance Defending Freedom, its lawsuit against California is ongoing.
In an interview with Bound4LIFE—a faith-based, pro-life organization—following the vote, Garlow discusses how he testified before Congress, his personal connection to life issues, and the covert strategy he sees at work in politics today. 
Bound4LIFE: What recent events in California led your church to file a lawsuit against the state to defend your pro-life convictions?
Garlow: On August 22, 2014, some nameless, faceless bureaucrat at the Department of Managed Health Care in Sacramento made a decision by fiat: that every insurance provider in the state of California had to include elective abortion in our plans.
I found out about that decision 60 days later. An attorney who assists us at Skyline Church said, ‘You’re now covering abortions in your insurance.’ I said, ‘There’s no way.’ ‘No, you are.’ ‘Surely not—we would’ve been notified or something! We would’ve seen this in the media?’ I asked our team to follow-up about it and that attorney was right. We were being forced to pay for abortions, and in fact everyone in California is.
We began to ask what we could do—what is our legal recourse? There were many conference calls. We appealed directly to Kathleen Sebelius, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services at the time. She stalled our inquiry forever and did nothing. HHS would not enforce the law as written, which protects our rights.
A number of churches, hospitals, as well as Christian universities, both evangelical and Catholic, filed a complaint against the federal government. On June 22, a federal agency dismissed that coalition complaint. Our church filed a separate lawsuit against the state of California in a federal court, which is currently ongoing.

Bound4LIFE: Are there specific policies already enacted that protect medical professionals—or any citizens—who do not want to be involved in abortion?
Garlow: If you’re an OB-GYN doctor or a nurse, and you refuse to perform an abortion, there are several federal statutes that protect you. The Hyde Amendment is the most well-known, prohibiting federal funding of abortion. There’s the Church Amendments—not named for “church,” like a congregation; it refers to Frank Church, former senator from Idaho.
There’s also the Coats-Snowe Amendment, named for Dan Coats and Olympia Snowe. They are two people on opposite sides of the abortion issue, but they agreed that people should not be coerced to be involved in abortion.
But the Weldon Amendment, named after Congressman Dave Weldon who is a medical doctor, is the most relevant. The Obama administration has twisted the Weldon Amendment in such a way that, if any medical professional objected to providing abortions, they can be fired with no right to litigation.
It’s bizarre. When the law is violated, people always have the right to sue—but now none of these people could. On top of that, churches are also coerced to cover abortions.
I testified this past Friday before the Energy and Commerce Committee—their subcommittee on Health, chaired by Congressman Joe Pitts of Pennsylvania. I flew home, preached in San Diego, then flew back here Monday to speak to congressional staff about this issue—60 key people influencing their bosses, who are members of Congress.
We’ve been in meetings one after another with congressmen, specifically bringing up the Conscience Protection Act and how it helps correct these issues. I also have a new book called ‘Well Versed: Biblical Answers to Today’s Tough Issues;’ a team from Skyline Church came as volunteers and hand-delivered copies to all 535 members of Congress. They believe the message is that important.
Bound4LIFE: Now the vote just ended on this bill, how does it correct the issue of government discrimination against medical providers and churches like yours?
Garlow: We had a victory moments ago, when the Conscience Protection Act passed by a bipartisan majority vote of 245-182 in the U.S. House. Our team was seated in the House gallery praying. Now it will proceed to the U.S. Senate, where it will hopefully be voted on this fall.
This week, I’ve been sitting with attorneys who’ve been using all this legalese—some of which I did not follow, quite frankly. Let me approach the specifics in layman’s terms. This bill tightens the screws down on these amendments already enacted. It gets rid of this notion that you cannot sue if you’re coerced into providing an abortion. That’s the quick and easy way of understanding it.
This bill would take out the language where they twisted the Weldon Amendment to mean something different. The Obama administration released a statement last night saying the president would most certainly veto this bill if it arrives at his desk because it would ‘limit women’s health care.’
They are completely ignoring the reality of the shift. When they push for certain policies, the left at first says, ‘Let us do this—you’ve just got to tolerate it.’ Then next they say, ‘You’ve got to affirm it.’ And finally they say, ‘No, you’ve got to participate in this activity.’ In this case, they want us to participate in the killing.
They attempt these three levels every time: toleration, affirmation, participation. They are ruthless. They have no respect for the First Amendment rights of the Constitution.
Bound4LIFE: For someone who does not hold pro-life convictions, why should they support this bill?
Garlow: Tonight, we had three Democratic members join the majority in voting for this bill. Now the Democratic Party, according to its platform, is unashamedly pro-choice—I would call it pro-abortion, to be honest.
Many leaders mentioned earlier who wrote these amendments, such as Senator Frank Church, were Democrats who said that a person’s conscience should not be violated. There’s been a fair amount of bipartisan support for conscience rights, because this policy is not fundamentally about the issue of abortion.
Rather, it addresses: Is the First Amendment going to be respected? That question is on two levels. On one level, there are those of us who uphold the sanctity of life based on biblical reasons—we can point to chapter and verse, as well as church doctrine.
On a second level, there are atheists who object to abortion and they don’t have to give a theological reason for that. It’s a matter of conscience for them, period. No one should be forced to do something they find offensive.
This was emphasized strongly in the Energy and Commerce subcommittee forum. Two of us testifying were pastors, while two others were conscientious objectors whose stand for life was not tied to theological reasons. No American should be forced to participate in abortion.
Bound4LIFE: You noted your role as a pastor. Sometimes speaking of the value of every life seems distant or political to people. How does Skyline Church live out your pro-life beliefs?
Garlow: It concerns me that we live in a culture where people wonder, ‘Why should we care about a pro-life position?’ How ludicrous is that! The average person uses the word ‘abortion’ with far too much ease. When I was in front of the congressional committee, I said, ‘Let’s call it what it is: Abortion is dismembering a human being, ripping them to shreds. Innocent blood is flowing in the streets of our cities.’
At Skyline Church, we are activists. We hold accountable those in public life. We also adopt babies—I’ve adopted four myself. One of my adopted children is an adult now, who has adopted children. My wife passed away a number of years ago and I remarried, then I had stepchildren; one of my grandchildren is adopted.
My daughter-in-law, whom I claim as my own, runs an adoption ministry. So she’s standing for life full time on the frontlines. Some of our congregation goes out to abortion centers for the purpose of praying and reaching out in compassion. When I pastored in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, I was heavily involved on that important front.
Bound4LIFE: You mention Texas, which was at the center of a recent Supreme Court decision seen as a setback for the pro-life movement. Do you have hope as a pro-life pastor?
Garlow: I do have hope. The pro-life movement is very encouraging to me as a pastor. How we’re seeing the next generation take a stand against abortion is thrilling.
I have a cautious optimism, built on whether this nation has a critical mass of people who are willing to repent of sin, hold leaders accountable, and refuse to tolerate the kind of actions we’ve seen going on. We have tough battles here, but they are winnable to the extent that we will follow the word of God.

On Thursday, on his FOX Business show, investigative reporter and libertarian commentator John Stossel engaged in a rapid-fire exchange over marriage policy with Heritage Foundation scholar Ryan Anderson.
In a provocative edition of “Stossel,” themed as “Libertarians vs. Conservatives,” Anderson was the sole guest for a segment exploring how the two groups may differ on marriage.
Stossel raised a range of objections to Anderson, who emphasized the common ground of religious liberty conservatives and libertarians share on marriage policy.
“What we’re concerned about is when the baker, florist, photographer or Christian adoption agency is coerced, penalized, even shut down by the government for wanting to treat the union of a man and a woman in marriage as distinctive,” said Anderson.
“We’ve seen Catholic Charities’ adoption agencies forced out of finding homes for orphans—because they wanted to find moms and dads for orphans,” Anderson added. “How is that ‘live and let live’?”
The two found agreement on protecting the conscience rights of business owners with Stossel concluding, “These cases are outrageous… and not just for religious freedom.”

Culture reporting has been abuzz lately with the “rise of stay-at-home dads,” as Pew Research announced earlier this month that their numbers have doubled over the past two decades.
Pew Research found that stay-at-home dads peaked in 2010, in tandem with the Great Recession. The report also finds 23 percent of dads stay home due to a failed job search — a story Roy Baldwin of Colorado Springs, Colo. knows all too well.
After a work transition, Baldwin became primary caregiver to his three children, he related in an interview with The Daily Signal.
“A few years ago my family experienced some pretty significant life changes, with unemployment being one of them,” Baldwin recounted. “I vividly recall my wife and I sitting down in tears, re-looking at our plans and dreams for our family.”
He begins to relate the emotionally complex time at arm’s length. “In some situations, wives may feel like they’re carrying the burden of being the primary breadwinner and missing out on being involved as the primary caregiver for the kids, and husbands may struggle with feelings of inadequacy. I know that was our experience.”
Baldwin noted he found “amazing support” during this time through the National At-Home Dad Network, devoted to providing education and advocacy for fathers who are primary caregivers.
The group recently stated their concerns with the new report in a detailed response, writing in part:
           “While we are ecstatic to see Pew Research speak about their being over 2          million stay-at-home dads in the United States in 2012, we also have major             concerns with their definition…
Their study is not truly about ‘stay-at-home dads,’ but rather about dads of young            children who are unemployed. There is a difference.”
Baldwin landed a full-time position again in 2009 — as Director of Parenting and Youth at Focus on the Family, a nonprofit ministry dedicated to helping families thrive.
He stresses the uptick in men becoming stay-at-home dads — some for only a season — points to a positive trend of fathers taking a more active role in their children’s lives.
“I’ve seen many men who are doing an excellent job as stay-at-home dads. At a broader level, we’re seeing more and more dads engaging with their families,” Baldwin says with enthusiasm. “Today’s dads are finding a greater sense of purpose and identity in their roles as fathers, whether they’re in the workforce or staying home with the kids.”
“Children thrive when their dads are involved, so it’s been encouraging to see so many men step up to the plate when it comes to investing in their kids. This needs to be celebrated and embraced.”
He also highlighted the Pew report’s bottom line: 84 percent of stay-at-home parents are moms rather than dads.
As a contributor to Focus on the Family’s Dad Matters blog. Baldwin integrates the wisdom gleaned from his own experiences, other experts on-staff, and over 5,000 counseling calls the Christian ministry fields every month.
So what should families consider if dad is taking on the role of caregiver at home for a time?
“We recommend a couple be intentional about talking things out to make sure they’re on the same page,” Baldwin advises. “It goes back to making sure the arrangement is best for their particular family during the season of life they’re in.”
Even though his own time as a stay-at-home dad wasn’t easy, Baldwin says “that experience drew us closer together in ways that I will always treasure.”

Texas is getting under some people’s skin.
Its population is growing. Its people are becoming more prosperous. It is creating both billionaires and employing more minimum-wage workers than any other state. Its energy sector has thrived—year-over-year drilling has doubled so far in 2014, with 10,000 new wells drilled just since January. Its technology corridor now extends for hundreds of miles along I-35.
Texas is the hottest state economy this side of North Dakota. But some still refuse to acknowledge the Texas Miracle.
The recovery benefits only the rich, they say. Pro-business means pro-big-business. Job growth has merely kept pace with population growth.
But that’s just it. People are moving to Texas, and it certainly is not for the weather. Its population has grown more than 5 percent just since 2010—a rate exceeded only by North Dakota, another oil-boom state, and the rapidly gentrifying District of Columbia. California, by contrast, lost congressional seats for the first time in state history after the 2010 census.
Texans see this growth everywhere they go.
“You kind of look around and see your neighbors are driving a little nicer car or you realize the restaurants are a little bit more crowded than they used to be or there might be a little bit longer line at the ballpark for hot dogs or something like that,” said Patrick Jankowski, a Houston-based economist. “Everyone is benefiting from what’s going on.”
As the steady drumbeat continues, including job growth and improved livelihood in Texas, the naysayers have distilled their argument to two main points—the oil and gas revolution blocks renewable fuels or the Texas Miracle is actually a statistical mirage.
The first of these complaints is dead on.
Cheap and plentiful oil and gas is beating subsidized, expensive and unreliable solar and wind energy hands down. Much to the chagrin of solar industry lobbyists, as National Journal pointed out in a recent story–“Why Is Texas Terrible at Producing Solar Power?” –Texas refuses to subsidize one form of energy when another is so plentiful, so prosperous on its own and so capable of employing thousands of citizens.
[Solar] has also taken a beating from economic forces. Electricity is typically dirt cheap in Texas, making it hard for any power plant to turn a profit, especially one with high up-front costs like a solar farm. And the fracking boom has stiffened competition for solar energy as the supply glut and resulting price dip in fuel prices has made natural-gas power plants a more attractive option.
Exactly. And that’s what makes the facts of Texas’ economic strength difficult for critics to refute.
Texas goes light on regulation, charges no state income tax, reduces barriers to entry and creates a dynamic business climate. California charges high taxes, imposes significant regulations, makes it hard to start a new business and has billions of dollars in debt for pensions owed to retired public employees.
So it should come as no surprise Texas’ business climate is rated in the top 5; California’s is in the bottom 10. Texas has had four times the job growth of California over the last 20 years. Its unemployment is about 50 percent below California’s and its incomes are growing at a faster pace than California’s.
“For Californians to pretend that they are doing as well as Texas is a great delusion,” said former Reagan economist Arthur Laffer, who himself moved from California to Tennessee.
Nicolas Loris, who studies energy and environment issues as the Herbert and Joyce Morgan Fellow at The Heritage Foundation, says the growth in Texas’ oil and gas sector benefits other Texans and even those beyond its borders.
“Economic opportunity created by the fracking revolution does not stop in oil and gas industries, but ripples throughout the U.S. economy,” Loris said. “The abundance of cheap, fracked natural gas has fueled employment growth in the manufacturing sector by making U.S. companies more competitive. And lower energy costs have given Americans more disposable income, which encourages further growth.”
Heritage Foundation Chief Economist Stephen Moore noted this week that, without the jobs that have been created in the oil and gas industry, the United States would have produced no net jobs over the last five years.
“These are cheap, abundant and made-in-the-USA jobs producing forms of electric power,” Moore said.
Moore will address energy policy and state wealth-creation in an upcoming Heritage event on Thursday. It is centered on his new book, An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of States. Moore co-authored the book with Laffer and philanthropist Rex A. Sinquefield, also speaking at the Heritage event.

Clearly the conservative “wave” election last week favored one party over another. Yet on policy issues, is there a unifying thread among newly elected leaders at the federal and state level?
Listening in to the winning candidates and their stories, a strong commitment to one cause stands out: protecting life. Young, vibrant and diverse, these leaders express a resolve to act on their convictions when they take office.

From People Magazine to BuzzFeed to Roll Call, national media cannot stop talking about Mia Love. Yet she and her husband Jason seem more concerned with raising their three children than basking in the spotlight.
“My children have dreams and all they want to do is fulfill those dreams,” she says in one of her campaign ads. “Washington needs a little bit more of that.”
Endorsed by pro-life advocacy groups, Love has spoken out often against taxpayer funding of abortion. “The role that government plays is to protect life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,” she said in a Fox News interview. “We should be protecting life.”

8. Sam Brownback
As a congressman, senator and most recently governor, Sam Brownback has been at the forefront of protecting defenseless pre-born lives for nearly two decades.
He signed into law 13 pro-life measures during his first term as Kansas governor, including one that established the Midwest Stem Cell Therapy Center—an innovative medical center using only adult stem cells in its clinical research studies, rather than embryonic stem cells that involve ending potential pre-born lives. The center has already seen medical breakthroughs in its first year.

While being a pro-life conservative in California politics is no easy task, Mimi Walters has been up to it since 1998. She’s served as city councilwoman, mayor, state representative, state senator… and now U.S. representative for California’s 45th Congressional District.
Founder of the California Women’s Leadership Association, her business background brings added weight to her strong pro-life stance.

 6. Greg Abbott
In summer 2013, the “pro-life law of the century” was hotly debated in the Texas State Legislature. Greg Abbott, attorney general under Gov. Rick Perry, led the legal fight to ensure its enactment following the bill’s passage by a large bipartisan majority.
During that contentious time, when pro-choice advocates protested without civility, Abbott impressed the Houston Chronicle with his winsome answers on abortion policy: “Two sides try to fight each other, but in reality, our goal—our real goal—is to express a greater sense of love and inclusion and support for all life.”
Supporters poured over $36 million into the candidacy of Abbott’s opponent, Wendy Davis. Following Abbott’s win by a 20-point margin, even the Texas Observer admitted: standing for abortion is “a difficult issue for Democrats in Texas.”

A college freshman running for statewide office caught the attention of national media even before she won. But what’s striking about Saira Blair is the depth of her conviction. Without the market-testing and consultants of larger campaigns, her pro-life statement of principles rings true.
“I believe that life begins at conception, so I consider abortion the act of taking human life,” she states. “We should not spend our tax dollars to fund such procedures. I’ve been blessed with life and I believe every child should have that same opportunity.”
Blair plans to take a hiatus from her studies at West Virginia University next semester to be present for the West Virginia House of Delegates’ 60-day legislative term.

After a successful business career involving international trade and two years in the U.S. House, Steve Daines has shown strong leadership on life—as revealed in a FactCheck.org post on his pro-life views.
While his opponent was endorsed by a prominent pro-abortion advocacy group, Daines co-sponsored the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which is designed to protect pre-born children capable of feeling pain in the womb.

It’s a win few thought possible: a 30-year-old, pro-life conservative representing liberal New York in Congress. With her small business experience, track record in crafting public policy, and endorsement from Susan B. Anthony List, Elise Stefanik has turned heads coast-to-coast by winning on principle.
In a spring debate against her Republican challenger, she made a point of calling herself “the only pro-life candidate” in the race; her opponent said he was pro-choice, but “would have a pro-life voting record in Congress.” New Yorkers, it seems, do not respond well to double-speak.

In her first term as governor, Fallin signed into law three significant pro-life bills that benefit the citizens of Oklahoma. As co-chairwoman of the National Pro-Life Women’s Caucus, she offers her executive experience and Midwest wisdom in this volunteer role that helps connect the pro-life movement nationally.

On Monday, new mom and pop/country superstar Kelly Clarkson released “Heartbeat Song”—an upbeat, synth-driven single that celebrates her new baby girl in a unique way.
“The beat is actually River’s heartbeat slowed down from when she was in my tummy!”shares Clarkson in a radio interview. Clarkson and her husband Brandon Blackstock, married in 2013, welcomed their baby girl River Rose into the world on June 12, 2014.
A preview of the track released first on Twitter, in a video featuring pink-clad baby River:
It's here…the first official #HeartbeatSong teaser! Share on http://t.co/VQIYiQYKaZ – Team KC
https://t.co/R5twtw8arm
— Kelly Clarkson (@kelly_clarkson) January 9, 2015

Released in its entirety on Monday, “Heartbeat Song” raves about her experience of motherhood with these lines:
Until tonight, I only dreamed about you
I can’t believe I’ll ever breathe without you
Baby, you make me feel alive and brand new
River is visiting me on the set of my new music video shoot for Wrapped In Red! #babysfirstvideo

After winning the first season of “American Idol” and achieving three No. 1 hits on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart (with seven more in the Top 10) since then, Clarkson has worked for three years on the follow-up to “Stronger (What Doesn’t Kill You)”—her most successful single ever, with more than 5 million copies sold.
On the same day as “Heartbeat Song” released, two national pro-life groups released a collaborative video calling attention to the “Heartbeat” court cases being heard in federal appeals court the following day.

The two cases, heard back-to-back on Tuesday, concern recent laws passed in Arkansas and North Dakota—restricting abortions based on when a baby’s heartbeat is detected. Seeing the potential for life-saving state policies, Matt Lockett of Bound4LIFE International and Lou Engle of TheCall have been tracking these cases for months.
“For these two events to unexpectedly happen at exactly the same time should make us all ponder for a moment,” says Matt Lockett, Executive Director of Bound4LIFE.
He continues, “For ‘Heartbeat Song’ to come along, set to the heartbeat of her baby in the womb, just as two important Heartbeat laws are being defended in court—it’s either an extraordinary coincidence or a confirmation. I take it as a great confirmation that God is drawing our attention to the sanctity of life in the womb.”

In the two court cases, heard Tuesday at the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis, Mo., pro-life advocates present in court say they are encouraged by how the states made their case.
“Both states approached these issues using an entirely new argument that has never before been heard in federal court,” says pro-family legal advocate Allan Parker. His group The Justice Foundation filed briefs supporting the states’ cases with an innovative legal strategy centered on Safe Haven laws.
A decision by the federal appeals court is expected in a matter of months.

After 10 years in communications and marketing roles at The Heritage Foundation and Focus on the Family, Josh Shepherd serves as communications manager at Bound4LIFE, a faith-based pro-life organization.
In the latest challenge to Texas’ so-called “pro-life law of the century” (passed as H.B. 2), last week a three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard the case Whole Woman’s Health v. Lakey.
Abortion providers, including Whole Woman’s Health Clinic in McAllen, Texas, sued the state to keep key provisions of H.B. 2 from being enforced. The law passed the Texas House by a bipartisan majority of 96-49 and was signed into law on July 18, 2013.
“States are free to regulate the practice of medicine for the safety of patients,” states Allan Parker, an attorney and pro-family legal advocate present in the courtroom during the hour-long hearing. As president of The Justice Foundation, Parker and his legal team filed a brief in support of the state.
“Texas now has a pro-life legislature,” he continues. “Surely the will of the people in this area should be the law. Most people want to protect human life and protect women.”
The passage of H.B. 2 in Texas is regarded as a landmark event in the pro-life movement, spurring other states to enact similar common-sense protections for women and pre-born babies.
The Justice Foundation’s legal brief documents testimonies of 3,279 post-abortive women and the negative effects of abortion on their lives.
“We represent women who have suffered injury after having an abortion,” Parker says. “Years later, many still deal with psychological injuries and emotional scars: suicidal thoughts, depression, anxiety, and nightmares.”

Medical research studies on health risks faced by post-abortive women have multiplied in recent years. “Texans, and in fact all Americans, need to be involved in protecting women’s health and protecting the lives of children,” stresses Parker.
Oral arguments in this court case centered on whether two major provisions of H.B. 2 were constitutional: requiring abortion centers to have the same safety standards as ambulatory surgical centers, and mandating that doctors performing abortions have admitting privileges in a local hospital.
The New York Times reports that the three-judge panel “also criticized a lower court for voiding the entire surgery-center law, rather than specifying which parts were justified and which were not.”
Parker notes that the line of questioning on physician admitting privileges seemed to reveal the judges’ support of this requirement.
“Directing these doctors to have hospital admitting privileges does not bother true medical professionals at all,” Parker says. “That’s just part of good medical practice.”
Jonathan Mitchell, solicitor general of Texas who argued on the state’s behalf, faced more difficult questions around raising abortion centers’ health and safety standards up to ASC requirements.
“There is some cost involved to widen hallways and increase sanitary conditions in a clinic,” Parker acknowledges. “At least one of the judges was not convinced on the need for this type of requirement.”

After interviewing more than 3,000 post-abortive women for The Justice Foundation’s court brief, Parker challenges this reluctance.
In a botched abortion, a woman ends up needing to quickly go to an emergency room—which is why these abortion centers need doorways and hallways large enough for a gurney. The woman also needs continuity of care once in the hospital, rather than an abortionist who is nowhere to be found.
In line with many court observers, Parker believes the three-judge panel will uphold H.B. 2.
“The judges want to support the will of the people through their elected legislature if they can,” says Parker. “The state presented a lot of compelling evidence that would allow the judges to do that.”
This court case is the latest episode in a nearly two-year struggle, as Texas legislators have prioritized saving defenseless pre-born lives. A decision from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals is expected within a matter of months.

After 10 years in communications and marketing roles at The Heritage Foundation and Focus on the Family, Josh Shepherd serves as communications manager at Bound4LIFE, a faith-based pro-life organization.
A new multimedia history museum is now under construction in Washington, D.C.—an eight-story, 430,000 square-foot experience dedicated to the best-selling, most-read and most-banned book of all time: the Bible.

Slated to open in fall 2017, the Museum of the Bible will be a significant addition to the city’s cultural and tourism landscape, offering a scholarly approach to the ancient biblical text—with a modern presentation.
Photo: Josh Shepherd
“Our research shows that an estimated 2 million people per year will visit the museum once it opens,” says Shannon Bennett, community relations director for Museum of the Bible.
Photo: Josh Shepherd
The driving force behind the new museum is Oklahoma businessman Steve Green, president of Hobby Lobby (below). In June, he and his family won a contentious Supreme Court case, a decision hailed by the pro-life movement as a victory for religious freedom.

The Washington Post recently chronicled Green’s personal journey to becoming chairman of Museum of the Bible:
The product of an Oklahoma family filled with pastors, Green has long been driven to spread the story of the Bible. He has poured millions into translation projects in developing nations and is a major benefactor to conservative evangelical universities, including Oral Roberts and Baylor.
After purchasing a few valuable artifacts beginning in 2009 during the economic recession, within a few years Green gradually acquired one of the world’s largest collection of biblical relics and manuscript—now nearly 50,000 items, from the time of Abraham (father of the Jewish nation) to the modern era.
Green’s team of scholars preview the museum’s vast collection in a new video:

“We have all sorts of artifacts that tell the story,” says Bennett. “Stained glass windows, Julia Ward Howe’s hand-written ‘Battle Hymn of the Republic’ lyrics, Dead Sea Scroll fragments—and we place them in immersive environments.”

But Green will not purchase merely any relic. “Each item in the collection helps tell one of three stories,” notes Bennett.
She explains, “First, to reveal how the Bible was translated and transmitted throughout the ages; to demonstrate the Bible’s impact on culture, including government, the arts, sciences, even humor; and finally, to demonstrate the narrative of the Bible itself, with artifacts that illustrate the stories.”
Photo: Josh Shepherd
The heart of the eight-story museum will be those three narrative ideas—entire floors dedicated to the Bible’s historical journey, narrative stories and global impact.

“We take a strong scholarly approach with the museum; this is not about proselytizing, rather tracing the Bible’s journey across history,” says Bennett.
She hints that other prominent institutions are catching the museum’s vision, noting, “We are in discussions with other prestigious international museums regarding their potential involvement in the D.C. project.”
Photo: Josh Shepherd
Even the artistic elements of the museum, like stained glass, will tell part of the story. “Stained glass is significant because, in the Middle Ages, most people were illiterate,” Bennett explains. “People learned the stories of the Bible through the stained glass.”
Photo: Josh Shepherd
The museum’s unique blend of ancient art, touchscreen technology and in-depth scholarship is no small project.
As the New York Times reports, “Adding up the value of over 40,000 planned artifacts, the real estate and the cost of renovations, the museum is an $800 million venture.” While Green and his family are the primary backers, a larger campaign to involve others in the project is underway.
Photo: Josh Shepherd
Cary Summers, chief operations officer for Museum of the Bible, explained in a recent interview why Washington, D.C., was chosen for the museum.
“Because the city is known as a destination for world-class museums, studies conducted by the museum team found that the Museum of the Bible would be best attended in Washington as opposed to other cities,” he says.
Photo: Josh Shepherd
As community relations director, Bennett has cultivated relationships with many faith-based groups in the area.
“Whether it’s a policy group like Family Research Council or prayer groups like Justice House of Prayer and David’s Tent, God has called so many people to Washington who are passionate about His Word and about our nation,” she notes.
Photo: Josh Shepherd
Bennett believes the museum will be a connecting point for many diverse groups driven by a faith grounded in the Bible. “I had someone come up to me crying the other day and say, ‘We’ve been waiting for something like this for so long.’”
“God has given me the gift of encouragement,” she says. “This is really the answer to so many prayers that have been lifted up over many years.”
Photo: Josh Shepherd
Dr. Josephine Dru, a biblical scholar featured in the museum’s new video, states, “We’re trying to do justice to the wide range of people who have claimed this book as their own—and have participated in its becoming one book.”
Photo: Josh Shepherd
Getting to this point, with construction now in full-swing, has been quite a journey as the extensive Washington Post story notes:
In July 2012 the museum’s board purchased for $50 million the 430,000-square-foot Washington Design Center, a massive red brick building that was built in 1919 as a refrigerated warehouse.
Bennett picks up the history of the building. “Virginia Railway trains used to unload their produce here; with the invention of freezer cars, this building fell into disuse until the 1980s.”
Photo: Josh Shepherd
She continues, “John F. Kennedy’s father Joseph purchased it and opened the Washington Design Center, which for decades has served as a showroom for high-end furniture makers.”
These custom designers and artisans have now moved 15 blocks away, to the newly christened Washington Design Center in Northwest D.C., allowing interior demolition work to proceed.
Photo: Josh Shepherd
For Museum of the Bible, the building is only one element of the development process underway. Both live-action and animated film content—to be shown as “holograms and on video screens that re-enact historical scenes related to the Bible” as a recent report stated—are in production.
To use the biblical vernacular, watch and pray for more details to come.

The creator of the independent film “Voiceless” hopes to shift the national conversation about unplanned pregnancies by showing the impact one church can make through local outreach and pro-life advocacy.
“My struggle has always been with the church, as it has been having confrontation with the world,” says Pat Necerato, a street preacher turned filmmaker who wrote and directed “Voiceless.”
“I wanted to create a film to challenge the church to get involved in the public square,” Necerato says.
With a budget of nearly $1 million and slated for release Oct. 7 in hundreds of theaters, “Voiceless” aims higher than most faith-based films in terms of production quality.
But it’s the story and true-to-life script, born from Necerato’s own experiences, that make it uniquely suited to help move the pro-life cause out of cultural stalemate.
“Voiceless” will premiere Oct. 2 in Washington, D.C., at a most unlikely venue:  a large screen outside the U.S. Supreme Court.
Five Years in the Making
“You always write from personal experience,” Necerato, 46, says. “I was pretty much all of the characters in this movie at one point or another.”
“Voiceless” centers on Jesse Dean, an Army veteran who moves to Philadelphia with his wife to work at a local church. While his hands-on outreach gives him inroads into the community—teaching free boxing classes, for starters—it begins a series of increasingly tense conversations within the church.

“I cannot tell you how many times I’ve heard Christians, even pastors, say: ‘We need to be saving souls, not so much worried about confronting evil,'” recalls Necerato, echoing a key scene in the movie:
Those words never really jibed well with my theology that Christ is king, he can redeem any aspect of our world, and he has called Christians to be saved and be a part of it. That’s the big picture.
One of my favorite lines in the movie is when Jesse says, ‘We are saved for the world, not from the world.’ It encapsulates the theme of ‘Voiceless’ and it speaks to my personal background—urging the church to confront the evils of society.
“I was a street preacher, and I still am,” Necerato, who lives in Trenton, New Jersey, says. “Rather than some stereotype of a crazy guy screaming on the corner, being a public witness can be done in a God-honoring way. Where evil is being lifted up unchallenged, I believe we can go out and proclaim the Gospel there just as strong.”
Answering Hard Questions
While popular culture tends to present abortion as merely political, “Voiceless” reframes the issue in moral, cultural, and personal terms.
“What is right? What should we be doing—a mercy ministry? Should we be prioritizing individuals? Should we be confrontational?” Necerato asks. “I wanted to create a movie that could address some of those questions with a real-life guy in real-life situations.”
Jocelyn Cruz, the co-lead in “Voiceless,” has a personal connection to the film’s focus on lives in the womb.
Cruz, whose previous roles in the hit movies “Marriage Retreat” and “This Is Our Time” helped her land the part, points to how the abortion center in the film has a sign out front that states “empowering and protecting.”

“Empowering and protecting women, children, and families at large is one of my passions,” Cruz says. “I am a trained postpartum doula, so I work with families right after birth. I get to see and experience firsthand how important it is to have a community of people around you while raising a child.”
In a way that complements the director’s perspective, Cruz says other questions are also at the heart of “Voiceless.”
“How can we best empower [pregnant] women by helping them? How can we be there for them when they have the babies? How can we work with and support the family?” asks Cruz, whose character in the film plays a pivotal role rescuing women who are vulnerable to abortion.
“A mother can only give as much as she has, so I feel it’s of extreme importance to help them fill up their storehouse so they can best take care of their new child,” Cruz says.
Production Packs a Punch
With the script complete and budget secured, Necerato and his team sought out a location to shoot “Voiceless” while simultaneously beginning the casting process.
“I wanted it to have a gritty and gray working-class look to it. Choosing Philadelphia fit with that: the architecture, the L-train—the whole ‘Rocky’ feel of the city,” Necerato says, adding:
Metaphors are used throughout the story, with Jesse being a war veteran who was fighting for our country; then coming home, and now fighting to protect life and stop violence. He is a boxer who ends up teaching boxing. Shooting ‘Voiceless’  in Philly was really about the aesthetics of the film reflecting underlying themes.

For Cruz, filming on location in the City of Brotherly Love was an adventure.
“This was the first time I’ve shot a movie outside of California, so it was really fun getting to travel to Philadelphia and experience a different part of the country,” Cruz says.
The movie also stars Hollywood actors Rusty Joiner (“CSI: Miami,” “ER,” “Bones”), James Russo (“Beverly Hills Cop”), and Paul Rodriguez (“Ali”). But it also highlights locally based actors in key roles.
“I believe we were able to capture some of the best talent coming out of Philadelphia: Brian Wilson, who starred in ‘Creed,’ Christopher Mann from ‘House of Cards,’ Susan Moses, and many others,” Necerato says. “Our casting director Melanie Forchetti and I rolled up our sleeves and saw over 200 auditions to arrive at this exciting ensemble cast.”
At the Northeast Film Festival, “Voiceless” stars Joiner and Victoria Gates took home best actor and best supporting actor awards for their performances.  The pro-life indie movie also won best feature film.
With a national release on the horizon, the true accolades for cast and crew will be audiences connecting with the story.
Speaking Life Into Personal Pain
Necerato says he hopes his film will spark conversations.
“There are all kinds of reasons—political, spiritual, and emotional—that people avoid talking about abortion,” he says.
“Voiceless” addresses issues surrounding unexpected pregnancies in a holistic manner. Scenes of counseling and prayer outside an abortion center are paired with a heart-wrenching subplot: An African-American family is strapped for resources and unsure how to make room for another baby.
“I know some women personally who have had abortions,” Cruz says. “I can see there is still a lot of pain. Women feel trapped in a way and are scared to raise a child on their own. This is something most people don’t talk about, but it is very real.”
“Voiceless” reveals that issues surrounding unplanned pregnancies are complex. (Photo: Icon Media Group)
Stuart Migdon, executive producer for “Voiceless,” recalls how he and his girlfriend were pressured as teens by family members to have an abortion when they faced an unexpected pregnancy.
“Though we had no idea of how we were going to make it, we never thought about an abortion,” Migdon says in a recent interview. “We didn’t hesitate—we got married. We struggled for a while but pressed on. God knew what he was doing.”
Necerato brings up another personal aspect of the issue.
“We see abortion as a women’s issue, knowing how much women suffer physically and emotionally from it,” the director says. “But men also suffer from having these incidents in their past. We often try to sweep it under the carpet, doing anything we can to ease our conscience.”
Referring to how taxpayer dollars flow every year to abortion providers such as Planned Parenthood, Cruz has her own idea of how funding should be prioritized.
“Family counseling and postpartum support are services that can absolutely be afforded with the amount of money some groups like Planned Parenthood alone receive in government subsidies,” she says.
From Belief to Strategies That Save Lives
Asked about the diverse spheres of the pro-life movement, Necerato says, “In the battle to save lives, there is no one absolute approach. But the common denominator is always compassion and a heart of love.”
He sees prayer at abortion centers as a vital front for pro-life advocacy:
We are fighting an extremely weighty spiritual battle. When I’m at an abortion clinic, there is a different spiritual heaviness. Unless you’re prayed up, people out there on the front lines are not going to be spiritually equipped to endure this.
We are called very clearly from scripture to pray unceasingly. We could win decisively in the legal arena or other battles, but without prayer it’s not going to have the force and power.
Perhaps it’s no coincidence that “Voiceless” premieres just as 40 Days for Life ramps up its largest-ever national prayer campaign, while the pro-life organization Bound4LIFE marks 12 years praying at the Supreme Court.
Cruz and Necerato both emphasize how true convictions must be lived out with actions.
“We have to pray and go, pray and move, pray and act,” the director says.
“Voiceless” opens nationwide Oct. 7. Visit the official website for updated theater listings.

After 10 years in communications and marketing roles at The Heritage Foundation and Focus on the Family, Josh Shepherd serves as communications manager at Bound4LIFE, a faith-based pro-life organization.
Following over a year of rave reviews and prestigious awards at film festivals worldwide, this week the short film “Crescendo” attracted attention thanks to a release on YouTube for free viewing (above).
Based on the true story of Ludwig van Beethoven, “Crescendo” touches on issues ripped from today’s headlines—notably, sex trafficking, rape and the prevalence of chemical abortion.
The introspective, dream-like visual style of writer/director Alfonso Alvarez Barreda draws viewers into this 15-minute drama, in a vein similar to the feature-length film “Bella” (2006), which caught the eye of many mainstream filmgoers during its release.
It’s no wonder that Eduardo Verástegui, producer and star in “Bella,” served as producer on “Crescendo.” Formerly a model and music star in Mexico, he rediscovered his faith and launched Metanoia Films 10 years ago.
Verástegui isn’t the only name associated with the picture who has a story to tell. MTV announced the film’s YouTube release thanks to the involvement of Pattie Mallette as executive producer.
The mother of pop star Justin Bieber, she was advised during her pregnancy to abort her pre-born son due to her age and circumstances. Instead, she turned to a local crisis pregnancy center.
Mallette shared her story with the Wall Street Journal, an interview which mentions “Crescendo” and her memoir “Nowhere But Up.”

Crescendo is also a very personal project for co-producer Jason Jones, founder of Movie to Movement, who orchestrated the film’s marketing and promotional roll-out.
A recent interview notes:
Jones was just 17 when his pregnant girlfriend’s father, who discovered her secret when she tried to get prescription vitamins, forced her to abort her baby girl. ‘Crescendo’ is dedicated to Jessica Jones [his pre-born daughter lost to abortion], who would have been 23 at the time of the film’s release.
The short film has currently raised nearly $6 million to benefit pregnancy care centers.

"Remember Obamacare? The fight is far from over on the future of the Obama-era health insurance overhaul.
Republicans are making a list-ditch effort this year to turn the program and the money over to the state. This isn’t full Obamacare repeal, but would make a world of sense because states would be free to experiment and find ways to reduce costs and provide better services.
Democrats are adopting a new political spin, which is that everything is fine with Obamacare. They claim that the only reason premium and deductible costs keep exploding is because President Donald Trump repealed the individual mandate tax—which was nothing more than an unfair penalty on low-income families that can’t afford the high cost of the health law’s mandates.
But if Trump is to blame, why were the costs skyrocketing two years before Trump even entered the Oval Office?
The clear-eyed reality is that things aren’t going well with Obamacare. The predicted death spiral in the insurance market—higher costs cause more healthy people to drop coverage, which raises prices even more, and the cycle continues—is now irrefutably upon us. This law should really be renamed the UCA: the Unaffordable Care Act.
Here are eight reasons Obamacare needs to be repealed now, more than ever.
1. Health insurance is more expensive than ever.
Remember the promise that the average family would save $2,500 a year on health insurance? Forget about it.
In May 2017 the Department of Health and Human Services reported that average health insurance premiums doubled since 2013. How many families’ incomes doubled over that same period?
In 2018 costs have risen by another 19 percent for high-cost plans and 32 percent for the cheapest plans, according to a study by the Urban Institute. Overall inflation for all other goods and services are running at 2 percent.
2. Entitlement spending has exploded.
Obamacare has driven entitlement spending up much faster than expected. The projected budgetary cost of Obamacare subsidies and Medicaid expansions from 2018 to 2027 now totals $4.8 trillion. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that Obamacare and its Medicaid expansion are responsible for 44 percent of the projected future increases in entitlement spending.
3. Obamacare has not stopped the stampede of rising health care costs.
Instead of “bending the cost curve down,” national expenditures on health care continue to rise.
The year before Obamacare was fully implemented, health care amounted to 17.2 percent of U.S. gross domestic product. Last year that tab grew to 18.3 percent—an increase of almost $200 billion in health spending. The latest forecast for 2025 is that medical expenses will reach almost 20 percent of GDP.
4. Americans are paying more money for less health coverage.
According to Kaiser, the average deductible for people with employer-provided health coverage last year was $1,221 compared to $303 in 2006. Usually, you pay higher deductibles for lower premiums. Under Obamacare, you pay more when you get your hospital bill.
5. Fewer insurance choices.
According to federal and state data of insurer exchange options per county, more than 50 percent of our nation’s counties have only one insurer in 2018. Over 30 percent of counties are limited to two insurers. This means roughly 4 of 5 counties will have either just one or two Obamacare exchange insurers to choose from.
6. Medicaid enrollment is exploding.
The vast majority of Americans who have received insurance under the Obamacare law have enrolled in Medicaid. Medicaid enrollment has soared from 55 million to 74 million since 2013. Yet many physicians, health clinics, and hospitals don’t accept Medicaid. This means tens of millions of Americans often can’t choose the doctor, hospital, or treatment of their choice.
Medicaid users in major cities experience an average denial rate of 47 percent. Mid-sized city Medicaid users have an average denial rate of 40 percent.
7. Nearly 30 million Americans still uninsured.
On April 1, 2014, standing in the Rose Garden at the White House, President Barack Obama claimed that the Affordable Care Act meant “everybody” would have health insurance. Today, some 30 million Americans remain uninsured to this day.
Why? Families can’t afford the insurance.
In 2012, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that Obamacare exchange enrollment would increase by 9 million by 2016. Instead, an underwhelming 400,000 increase occurred, which is a staggering 96 percent reduction in the anticipated growth of net-ACA exchange enrollment.
8. Obamacare continues to ignore obvious cost-saving alternatives.
Obamacare does not allow patients to buy insurance across state lines, which would dramatically increase competition and lower costs. It does not allow small business-associated health plans. It limits low-cost health savings accounts options. It has no provisions for capping medical malpractice costs—because Democrats were bought off by the trial lawyers.
Let’s summarize what we have gotten for our money under Obamacare. We have spent hundreds of billions of dollars already; we have massively increased the size of the federal budget; we have subsidized insurance plans to get Americans to sign up for Obamacare; we have penalized people if they don’t buy Obamacare (until that law was repealed); but we still have almost 1 in 11 Americans without insurance.
Has there ever been a bigger public policy flop?
I recently debated a high-ranking Obama White House economist and asked him: What was the greatest accomplishment of Obama in eight years in office? He replied: the Affordable Care Act.
Really? If this is Obama’s grand success, imagine how bad the failures were.

"T.S. Eliot famously wrote that April is the cruelest month, but when it comes to America’s fiscal picture, nothing could be further from the truth about this past April. The latest government numbers confirm that last month was a blockbuster for growth, federal revenues, and deficit reduction.
One of the key principles of Trumponomics is that faster economic growth can help solve a multitude of other social and economic problems, from poverty to inner-city decline to lowering the national debt.
We’re not quite at a sustained elevated growth rate of 3 percent yet, but the latest economy snapshot tells us we are knocking on the door. The growth rate over the last four quarters came in at 2.9 percent, which was higher than any of the eight years of Barack Obama’s presidency.
Halfway through this current quarter, which began on April 1, the Atlanta Federal Reserve estimates growth at 4 percent. If that persists through the end of June, we will have reached an average growth rate of 3 percent under President Donald Trump.
Not bad, given that nearly every liberal critic trashed the president’s campaign forecast of 3 percent to 4 percent growth as an impossible dream.
Economists such as Larry Summers, Obama’s first chief economist, gloomily declared that we were mired in a new era of “secular stagnation” and that 3 percent growth was unachievable. Paul Krugman of The New York Times said it was more likely we would see flying cars than 3 percent to 4 percent growth.
Now for the even better news. We are already starting to see a fiscal dividend from Trump’s tax, energy, and pro-business policies. The Congressional Budget Office reports that tax revenues in April—by far the biggest month of the year for tax collections because of the April 15 filing deadline—totaled $515 billion, which was a robust 13 percent rise in receipts over last year.
MoneyWeek reports that the $218 billion monthly surplus (revenues over expenditures) this April was the largest ever, with the previous record being $180 billion in 2001. (April is always the one surplus month.)
Here’s the simple lesson: more growth, more tax revenue.
But there’s another lesson, and it is about how wrong the bean counters in Congress were who said this tax bill would “cost” the Treasury $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion in lost revenues over the next decade.
If the higher growth rate that Trump has already accomplished remains in place, then the impact will be well over $3 trillion of more revenue and thus lower debt levels over the decade. Putting people to work is the best way to balance the budget. Period.
Critics will dismiss the importance of these higher revenue collections by arguing that the new receipts are for 2017 tax payments, which don’t take account of the tax cut that passed in December. This ignores that some of the growth we have seen was a result of the anticipation of the tax cut. Moreover, the fact that the tax cuts are just sinking in means that we should get even higher growth rates for the next several years at least.
Alas, it is not all good news in the April surprise. The inexcusable omnibus spending bill increased federal spending by some $300 billion in 2018, and we are starting to feel the impact of that splurge. Federal outlays are up 8.7 percent in April. That’s unforgivable, given that Republicans run everything in Washington these days.
No one thought that Trump could ramp up the growth rate to 3 percent or that his policies would boost federal revenues. But he is doing just that—which is why all that the Democrats and the media want to talk about these days is Russia and Stormy Daniels.

"Take a wild guess what country is reducing its greenhouse gas emissions the most? Canada? Britain? France? India? Germany? Japan? No, no, no, no, no, and no.
The answer to that question is the United States of America. Wow! How can that be? This must be a misprint. Fake news. America never signed the Kyoto Protocol some two decades ago. We never enacted a carbon tax. We don’t have a cap-and-trade carbon emission program. That environmental villain Donald Trump pulled America out of the Paris climate accord that was signed by almost the entire rest of the civilized world.
Yet the latest world climate report from the BP Statistical Review of World Energy finds that in 2017, America reduced its carbon emissions by 0.5 percent, the most of all major countries. That’s especially impressive given that our economy grew by nearly 3 percent—so we had more growth and less pollution—the best of all worlds.
The major reason for the reduced pollution levels is the shale oil and gas revolution that is transitioning the world to cheap and clean natural gas for electric power generation.
Meanwhile, as our emissions fell, the pollution levels rose internationally and by a larger amount than in previous years. So much for the rest of the world going green.
The world’s largest emitter of carbon dioxide emissions is China. According to the invaluable Institute for Energy Research, “China produces 28 percent of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions. India is the world’s third largest emitter of carbon dioxide and had the second largest increment (93 million metric tons) of carbon dioxide emissions in 2017, more than twice as much an increase as the U.S. reduction.”
For every ton of reduced pollution the United States emits, China and India produce almost 10 more tons. This means it doesn’t really matter how much America reduces its greenhouse gases because China and India cancel out any and all progress we make.
Those who think they are helping save the planet by purchasing an electric car, or putting a solar panel on their roof, or trying to shut down coal production in the United States are barking up the wrong tree. If we want to stop greenhouse gases, there is no way to make progress without China and India on board—which they clearly are not.
This latest data also demonstrates that despite all of the criticism across the globe and in the American media, Trump was completely right to pull the United States out of the flawed Paris accord. That might be one of the most universally violated treaties of all time—which is saying a lot. The chart below shows that nearly every nation that signed on to the Paris accord and has admonished America for not getting in has already broken its promises.
(Chart by The Washington Times)
Not a single EU nation is within 80 percent of its respective target for emission reduction, according to Climate Action Network Europe. In its official EU report, Climate Action Network Europe said, “All EU countries are failing to increase their climate action in line with the Paris Agreement goal.” All but five countries aren’t even at 50 percent of their current targets.
So there you have it. The countries in the Paris climate agreement have broken every promise they’ve made and the nation that hasn’t signed the treaty is doing more than any other nation to reduce global warming. Yet, we are being lectured by the sanctimonious Europeans and Asians for not doing our fair share to save the planet. It’s another case study in how the left cares far more about good intentions than actual results. What matters is that you say that you will wash the dishes, not that you actually do it.

"President-elect Donald Trump has selected Andy Puzder, CEO of Carl’s Jr., the successful fast-food hamburger restaurant chain, as his secretary of labor. This has set off a bit of protest by the hard left and the union bosses.
How could Trump select someone who actually knows something about hiring workers and creating jobs? How dare he!
Puzder has grown Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s into a major U.S. employer with thousands of workers. He helped save the company and the employees. Big labor should be happy, right?
Hardly. Puzder has made a name for himself as a critic of Obamacare, many of the Department of Labor’s most mindless employment regulations, and a federal minimum wage hike.
He understands fully as a front-line victim that President Barack Obama’s Department of Labor was mostly a jobs killer—pushing forced union work rules, new overtime mandates that hindered small businesses, and other nuisance regulations.
Puzder will hopefully bring a swift and welcome change to the culture of this agency. In the past, the Labor Department has been a rubber stamp for the union bosses’ agenda. As an employer, Puzder knows what works and doesn’t work in the real marketplace for labor.
That’s exactly why the left is mounting a loud and vicious campaign against him. Groups like the George Soros-funded Media Matters and the big unions are lambasting Puzder as someone who wants to “replace workers with robots” and who is leading the charge to keep wages low by opposing the “fight for $15” minimum wage hike.
But these are spurious charges. On minimum wage, Puzder speaks common sense: He says he would support “minimum wage increases that are rational and do not destroy jobs or the businesses supporting them.” He is also of similar thinking to Trump: Leave the decision to the states.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that even a $10.10 minimum wage would kill 500,000 jobs, so a $15 minimum could bring job losses in the millions. That’s not pro-worker.
Similarly, the left has distorted Puzder’s views on automation and robotics. Puzder believes that mandated benefits like the minimum wage hikes are merely accelerating the move to automation in the restaurant industry. That is simply a well-substantiated fact. He has said many times that there are no robots that could replace the workers at Carl’s Jr.
Puzder has his finger on the pulse of the labor market. He predicted with great foresight that the Obamacare law would reduce hiring for businesses that near 50 workers—the employment threshold for the Obamacare regulations—and that the design of the Obamacare insurance would soon lead to a death spiral of rising costs in the market. He was right on both countsand for that too, the unions are out to bury him.
Does being right disqualify one from serving in the Cabinet? Trump wisely with this pick says no. Trump has also sent a message that he won’t knuckle under to the bullying tactics and the intimidation game that the left has engaged in for so many years.
This is supposed to be the Department of Labor, not the Department of the AFL-CIO. Sure the union perspective should be at the table, but it shouldn’t own the table.
Here’s a statistic for Puzder to keep in mind: Where union presence is strongest in America—places like Detroit and Newark—jobs are disappearing fast. Where states have right-to-work laws and not forced union rules, job creation is twice as swift.
If job creation is Trump’s top priority, he’s made a fabulous choice to run the Labor Department.

"Time magazine’s cover story for the week of Nov. 6 is a classic. It blares: “The Wrecking Crew: How Trump’s Cabinet Is Dismantling Government As We Know It.”
The New York Times ran a lead editorial complaining that Team Trump is shrinking the regulatory state at an “unprecedented” pace.
Meanwhile, last week the stock market raced to new all-time highs; we had another blockbuster jobs report with another fall in the unemployment rate; and housing sales soared to their highest level in a decade.
Are the editors at Time and the Times so ideologically blinded that they are incapable of connecting the dots?
The U.S. economic revival of 3 percent growth has already defied the predictions of almost every Donald Trump critic.
I vividly remember debating Hillary Clinton’s economic gurus during the campaign: They accused Trump and advisers such as myself of “lying” when we said that pro-growth policies would speed up economic growth to 3 to 4 percent.
Jason Furman, who chaired the Council of Economic Advisers under President Barack Obama, told reporters earlier this year that the chances of reaching 3 percent growth over a decade were about 1 in 25—which is what many political experts said was Trump’s chance of winning the election.
Another Obama economist, Alan Krueger, called the 3 percent growth forecast “extremely rosy.”
Larry Summers, a top economic adviser to Obama, questioned the “standards of integrity” of the Trump economic team’s forecast for 3 percent (or more) growth. “I do not see how any examination of U.S. history could possibly support the Trump forecast as a reasonable expectation,” he wrote in The Washington Post.
Congress weighed in, too. “This budget relies on absurd economic projections and pretend revenues that no credible economist would validate,” Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., announced at a House budget hearing.
The sharp-penned Paul Krugman of The New York Times declared Trump’s growth forecast an act of “economic arrogance.” He said the productivity improvement necessary for faster growth was as likely as “driverless flying cars” arriving “en masse.”
Admittedly, we shouldn’t read too much into six months of very good economic data (with 3 percent growth) or the booming stock market. These trends can always reverse course quickly. Trump’s more restrictive policies on trade and immigration could harm growth potential.
But so far the Trump haters have missed the call on the economy’s trajectory. Doubly ironic is that the same Obama-era economists who are trashing Trump’s increasingly realistic forecast of 3 percent growth are the ones who predicted 4 percent growth from the Obama budgets.
Obama never came anywhere near 4 percent growth, and at the end of his second term, the economy grew at a pitiful 1.6 percent.
Under Obama, free enterprise and pro-business policies were thrown out the window. What was delivered was the weakest recovery from a recession since World War II, with a meager 2.2 percent average growth rate. Middle America felt it, which is why Trump won these forgotten Americans.
One reason that economist Larry Kudlow and I and others assured Trump that 3 to 4 percent growth was achievable was that Trump could capitalize on the underperformance of the Obama years.
Under Obama, business investment fell almost two-thirds below the long-term trend line—thanks to higher taxes on investment. Now, partly in anticipation of the tax cut, business spending keeps climbing.
Maybe the liberal economists and their shills in the media should show some humility. They should acknowledge they were dead wrong about how much Obamanomics was going to grow the economy and about how Trumponomics would crash the economy and the stock market.
Or better yet, maybe the rest of us should all just stop listening to them.

"Republicans have long been known as “the stupid party.” They do stupid things, such as waiting until mid-November to push a must-pass tax cut that should have been done by April.
But in recent weeks the GOP has finally been showing some brains and some backbone on taxes. It is using its majorities in Congress to roll back and roll over the left, and it’s about time.
In a more rational world, tax reform could have been bipartisan. But once Democrats declared they would be unified obstructionists on tax reform, there was no reason to throw a bone to the “resistance movement.” Playing nice with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., won’t buy any votes, so why bother?
It’s hard not to be impressed with how Republicans have instead suddenly gotten very smart on the “pay fors” in their tax bill. Three of these revenue raisers are welcome policy changes, and they help defund the left.
Start with the elimination of the state and local tax deduction.
Congress shouldn’t subsidize flabby and inefficient state and local services and bankrupt public pension programs. Just as one would predict, the states with the highest taxes are Democrat-controlled states.
There is no evidence that higher taxes in these states lead to better schools or safer streets. New York spends around $7,500 per person on state and local government, while New Hampshire spends less than $4,500. Yet public services are better in New Hampshire than in New York.
The big blue states must cut their taxes and costs, or the stampede of high-income residents from these states will accelerate. The big losers here are the public employee unions—the mortal enemies of Republicans. This all works out nicely.
Next is the decision by Republicans to offset the cost of the tax cut by eliminating the individual mandate tax imposed mostly on moderate-income Americans.
About three of four people who pay the tax earn less than $50,000 a year. The purpose of the tax is to force low-income Americans to purchase insurance they either don’t want or can’t afford.
Isn’t it amazing that Obamacare provides subsidies to Americans if they buy the insurance and imposes penalties if they don’t, yet at least 13 million Americans still refuse to buy it? What a great product this must be.
Eliminating the individual mandate will allow poorer and younger Americans to buy less expensive forms of coverage, such as health savings accounts. These additional options will lead to the slow death of Obamacare. Smart.
Finally, there is the proposed tax on college endowments. These are massive storehouses of wealth: Harvard and Yale combined sit on a nest egg of almost $60 billion, enough to give every student free tuition at these schools from now until forever. Instead, these university endowments act like giant financial trading dynasties, with very little of the largesse going to help students pay tuition.
The GOP plan would put a small tax on the unspent money in the endowments if they don’t start spending the money down. My only complaint is that the tax is way too low. But the first shot against the university-industrial complex has finally been fired.
The productivity of American universities, as Richard Vedder of Ohio University has documented, continues to decline. Vedder also found that university tuitions don’t go down when these schools have bigger endowments. They go up.
These endowments subsidize the six- and seven-figure salaries of pompous, tired, and tenured professors (who teach four or five hours a week) and administrators. Bravo to Republicans for starting to turn off the spigot.
The best indication that this is all working is the rise of what I call the “tax bill crybaby caucus.” This group consists of health insurance companies, Obamacare supporters, public employee unions, state and local officials, the welfare lobby, municipal bond traders, lobbyists, and, most of all, the liberal politicians who are funded by all of the above.
Not only are we getting pro-growth tax policy but also President Donald Trump and the GOP are finally draining the swamp. It doesn’t get any better than this.

"It now appears that President Donald Trump’s intention regarding the North American Free Trade Agreement is to mend it, not end it.
That’s good news because the trade deal has been a stunning economic success for Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Freer trade has meant steady increases in the volume of trade, greater competitiveness, and lower prices.
But as Trump’s negotiators craft a NAFTA 2.0 deal, some things need to be fixed to assure America’s continued commanding heights in technology and innovation. Intellectual property rights—patents, copyrights, and so on—need to be better safeguarded.
There have been abuses. In an unprecedented move, Canadian regulators recently ordered an American pharmaceutical company to lower the price of the company’s breakthrough treatment for a rare blood disorder.
Canada is inventing new rules to avoid paying American pharmaceutical and technology companies for their innovations and inventions. This is also happening in Europe, where bureaucrats are trying to expropriate funds from American technology leaders, including Google, through bogus charges of monopoly activities.
The Trump administration should vigorously repel these economic attacks against American companies.
This is a very big deal for the American economy. Intellectual property is increasingly the lifeblood of our economy. Intellectual property-intensive industries support 28 million American jobs—or about 1 in 5 workers. About $6 trillion of our gross domestic product now is in intellectual property-related industries, including almost all of Silicon Valley.
Many of NAFTA’s intellectual property provisions do not prevent infringement of patent rights and, in some cases, outright theft (as in the case of China). This costs American consumers and businesses an estimated $200 billion annually.
Consider our drug companies.
American pharmaceuticals recorded $47 billion in exports in 2015. Yet despite this and the fact that the vast majority of drug breakthroughs come from America, the U.S. currently has a $700 million trade deficit with Canada and only a tiny trade surplus with Mexico in biopharmaceuticals.
Our trade partners do not want their citizens to pay for the costs of the research and development required to invent these breakthrough medicines in the first place. It typically requires $500 million to $1 billion to develop a new drug or vaccine, and American consumers shouldn’t bear the entire burden of those costs.
It drives up drug and health insurance costs in America, and it jeopardizes world health by delaying the development of future cures for cancer, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, Parkinson’s, and other terrible diseases.
Even worse, Mexico is producing “knockoff” drugs that are copycats of American pharmaceuticals. This is stealing, too, and negotiators should get tough on these practices south of our border.
The same abuses are happening with American trademarks and copyrighted materials. NAFTA doesn’t sufficiently protect movies, music, and games from theft and distribution online.
NAFTA should impose civil and criminal penalties for illicit access to cable and satellite signals and other preventable infringements in which American firms are not compensated for use of the product.
The future of free and fair trade depends on rigorous enforcement of America’s multitrillion-dollar intellectual property industries. This is about jobs—millions of them—and the rule of law.
It is also about encouraging the very innovation that promotes prosperity and better health in America—which we then export across the globe to the betterment of mankind.
It will also help boost public and business support for trade as a driver of growth in the years to come.

"Andy Vanderplas

Andy Vanderplas is a special assistant and research associate in The Heritage Foundation's Institute for Economic Freedom.
Business and homeowner utility costs could double in many states if environmental groups succeed in enacting draconian solar and wind power mandates in states across the country.
Yet these mandates will have almost no impact in cleaning the air or reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
In Arizona and Nevada, voters will decide on Nov. 6 whether to adopt renewable mandates requiring local utilities to buy at least 50 percent of their electric power from green energy—mostly, wind and solar power.
At least a dozen other states are set to ramp up their mandatory standards (also called “renewable portfolio standards”) in 2019. California is set to move to 60 percent legally mandated renewable energy by 2030 and 100 percent by 2045.
These mandates come with a steep price to American families and businesses. Residents in states with existing high mandates must often pay between 50 percent and 100 percent more on their electric bills than residents of states where utilities are free to rely on the market and purchase electric power from the lowest-cost sources—often coal, natural gas, or nuclear power.
Because lower-income households spend five to 10 times more as a share of their incomes on energy than do high-income households, high renewable portfolio standards are a regressive—and unduly burdensome—tax on the poor.
Ironically, these green initiatives are usually sponsored by billionaire liberal funders, such as investor Tom Steyer of California.
While the natural growth of renewable energy sources is a positive development, mandates are an economically disastrous method that crowds out the market for affordable electricity.
Today, the United States produces more than 75 percent of its electricity from natural gas, coal, and nuclear power. Less than 10 percent comes from solar and wind power.
Given the massive federal subsidies of more than $150 billion between 2009 and 2014 to the wind and solar industries, that is an amazingly small percentage.
Comparing the states with the most stringent renewable portfolio standards (25 percent or more) with the states with low ones (10 percent or less), and then with states with none, reveals a pattern.
States with high renewable portfolio standards have electric power rates that are about 27 percent per kilowatt hour more expensive than states with low ones, and about 50 percent higher than states without them.
The Heartland Institute estimates costs could total an extra $1,000 per year per household, compared with current electricity costs, at the proposed rate increase in Arizona.
This could mean tens of thousands of dollars of higher costs for a business, depending on energy usage. For manufacturers, it could mean $100,000 or more of extra costs.
Lower-income families would be most adversely affected by stricter green energy requirements. This is because poorer households typically pay about seven times more as a share of their income in energy costs than do wealthier families.
Middle-class families pay at least twice as high a share of their income in energy bills than do the rich.
One of the critical flaws of renewable energy requirements is that they almost all squeeze out two of the most dominant and cleanest forms of energy used across the country—natural gas and nuclear power.
But from an environmental and clean air standpoint, and for the purposes of reducing greenhouse gases that may be linked to climate change, this distinction makes no sense.
It appears simply to be a multibillion-dollar corporate welfare giveaway to the solar and wind industries at the expense of ratepayers.
Even coal that is burned in Arizona, Nevada, and other states is much cleaner today than it was 20 or 30 years ago. All of this is evidenced by the dramatic improvement in air quality nationally over the past 35 years.
Only a small percentage of this clean air progress is due to renewable energy, because over most of this period, wind and solar power have been fairly inconsequential sources of U.S. energy production.
Since 1980, total emissions of the six principal air pollutants have fallen by 67 percent.
To put that in perspective: That reduction occurred amid a dramatic expansion of the U.S. economy. Gross domestic product increased by 165 percent, vehicle miles traveled increased 110 percent, the U.S. population grew by 44 percent, and energy consumption increased by 25 percent.
For these reasons, the “clean energy” initiative is best thought of as a regressive tax imposed on those who can least afford it.
Again, this “tax” could cost middle-income and lower-income American families about $1,000 more per year in utility prices. These mandates could also negatively affect business productivity and move jobs to areas with more energy choices.
Americans deserve affordable, abundant, and reliable energy. Renewable energy mandates are a “green tax” on homeowners and small businesses that can least afford it.

"President Barack Obama needs a reality check. Earlier this month in Indiana, he accused his critics of ignoring the “facts” and purporting “myths” about his economic record. But if Republicans are truly ignoring the facts, Obama should consider it a blessing.
A quick look at the facts will show that Obama’s economic performance has been weak—even by his own standards.
In its budget for the fiscal year 2010, the Obama administration estimated that real gross domestic product would decline in 2009 by 2.8 percent that year and then increase by 2 percent in 2010.
Furthermore, the White House forecast that by 2011 its massive stimulus program would start paying off, with growth accelerating to 3.8 percent that year and then soaring above 4 percent from 2012 to 2014.
The chart below compares Obama’s predictions to actual growth statistics from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.
Sources: U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Office of Management and Budget
When it comes to economic growth, Obama has consistently failed to meet his own expectations. Not only has Obama’s economic recovery been the weakest of any post-recession recovery since World War II, but he is also on pace to become the first U.S. president in history to have never presided over a full year of growth averaging at least 3 percent.
But is this really surprising? We know that Obama has done virtually everything wrong when it comes to promoting growth.
Here’s a reminder:
1. Obamacare: When Obama pushed this boondoggle of a bill, he said on several occasions that it would lower health costs by $2,500 per family. Instead, insurance premiums have risen— in some cases nearly 30 percent.  On top of this, business owners are hiring fewer people to stay beneath the 50 employee threshold, which mandates business owners employing 50 people or more to provide full health insurance.
2. Regulation: It’s hard to grow, when the federal government is literally standing in the way of business.  According to a recent Heritage Foundation study, More than $22 billion per year in new regulatory costs were imposed on Americans, costing Americans nearly $100 billion annually under Obama’s presidency.      
3. Taxes: Obama has raised taxes on investment income by nearly 60 percent (raising capital gains tax from 15 percent to 24 percent), and pushed the top marginal tax rate (the tax on small business owners) to 40 percent.  The U.S. has the highest business tax rate in the world; causing companies to flee offshore (with jobs) to find a better deal elsewhere.
After nearly eight years of “hope and change,” wages are stagnant, growth is sputtering, entrepreneurship is in decline, our once great domestic companies are finding a better deal off shore, and more Americans are out of the work force than ever before.
The “facts,” Mr. Obama, speak for themselves.

The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 signed into law last week really should be renamed the Bipartisan Budget Crash Act.
This spending spree takes a Mack Truck and rams through the hard-fought budget caps under the 2011 Budget Control Act to the tune of at least $300 billion.
When all is said and done, the fiscal wreckage could be worse than that. With a federal debt already at $20.5 trillion, we have just lurched closer to fiscal insolvency.
Republicans touted that they got $1 of new military spending for every $1 of domestic social programs, but even that is wishful thinking at best. This calculation doesn’t include emergency disaster spending for hurricanes and fires, which was close to $90 billion. At least $21 billion of “defense” spending goes to the State Department instead, which does not fight wars.
In the end, the domestic agencies may wind up with $2 of added funding for every $1 for national security, which is hardly a good deal for taxpayers.
It also isn’t clear why the recovery efforts to pay for disaster relief should be paid for by the federal government.
In the wake of some of the worst disasters in American history—the hurricane that wiped out Galveston, Texas, the Great Chicago Fire, and the San Francisco earthquake, for example—the rebuilding of these cities happened swiftly and was almost all funded by private businesses, private charities, and state and local initiatives, not by Washington writing a big check.
And when, alas, the feds do write big checks for disasters, the money should come from across-the-board cuts of 2 or 3 percent from all the other federal agencies—not by running up the debt.
The Budget Control Act caps are now a victim of their own success. From 2011-2016, the spending caps held discretionary spending increases below the 2 percent level of inflation. For three years, federal spending actually fell, in no small part because of those caps.
But now those tight caps have been evaded four times in six years, and each time the overspending has been larger. The cork has been pulled off the champagne bottle.
The lack of spending restraint and the inability of Congress to keep its past legislative promises not only erodes trust in the political class, but shows a frightening and complete indifference by Washington toward our nation’s growing fiscal crisis.
The big question is, where do we go from here on the budget? With neither party at all committed to reducing debt and deficits, our worry is that the budget caps are, for all intents and purposes, gone forever.
The caps after 2020 are still technically in place, but the 2019 levels of spending are going to come in at as much as $200 billion above the 2020 caps. So either we see a massive cut in government spending in the election year of 2020, which would be a wonderful thing to behold—but is as likely as President Donald Trump and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi dancing a tango together—or, Congress throws the caps into the dustbin of history.
That’s a scary prospect, because it would mean that Congress would be budgeting without any fiscal guard rails or speed limits at all. This will only invite further bipartisan spending sprees that are against the interests of the American people.
The indefensible budget behavior of Congress over the last several weeks reinforces the case for Congress to extend the Budget Control Act caps into 2022 and beyond, since the caps expire at the end of 2021.
These future caps should be based on the 2011 Budget Control Act’s average annual spending growth rate, not the new budget’s enormous spending growth rate. Failure to extend the caps would be a total surrender and a green light to the already out-of-control Mack Truck.

"Congress passed and President Donald Trump signed a $1.3 trillion omnibus bill in late March. (Photo: Alex Edelman/UPI/Newscom)

Our national debt continues to balloon out of control, growing larger than the size of our entire economy.
This trend has been accelerated by Congress’ two most recent pieces of budget legislation: the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which obliterated the previous discretionary spending caps, and the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018, which followed through on that promise to bust the caps and recklessly spend taxpayer money.
One of the reasons the “cromnibus” bill so quickly busted the budget caps is because Republicans were willing to furnish the left’s unreasonable appetite to raise domestic spending. The bill increased domestic spending by almost $2 for every $1 of defense spending increases, in addition to the inclusion of emergency funds.
Examples of this overspending range from “small” million-dollar pet projects in Mississippi, New Jersey, and New York to billion-dollar increases compared to last year’s budget.
For example, the National Institutes of Health received a $3 billion bump—an 8.8 percent increase from the year before—while the Department of Homeland Security’s federal assistance grants were awarded over 50 percent more than its budget estimates.
By eliminating billions in international welfare, Congress could efficiently offset the tens of billions spent on post-disaster recovery in the United States. Instead, we see hundreds of millions actually going to other countries’ recovery efforts when the mission at home is left unfinished.
The almost certain return of trillion-dollar budget deficits shows that Congress is no longer trying to steward the nation’s fiscal health. Our nation should not be spending hundreds of millions of dollars in disaster aid in foreign countries through the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance when Florida, Texas, and Puerto Rico are still struggling.
The spending bill did secure long-needed increases for the military. Those increases will pay for new weapons, ships, and other equipment such as drones. Specifically, it funds 14 Navy vessels, 90 fighter aircraft, and gives military personnel about a 2.5 percent raise.
More funding will also go to military training, supplies, and equipment maintenance, which will directly support our military’s readiness and safety.
Despite these wins, the omnibus bill is a net loss as it concedes to Democrats on most domestic priorities, including giving $500 million of taxpayer funds to Planned Parenthood. In busting open the deficit, Republicans are jeopardizing the economic benefits of tax reform.
Those in Congress who care about the country’s fiscal health need to take swift measures to make sure this pattern doesn’t continue.
Congress should amend the Budget Control Act of 2011 to make the budget caps applicable to all federal spending (which includes entitlements) so that these one-sided results do not continue. This would also help reign in out-of-control entitlement spending, which makes up over 63 percent of Congress’ entire federal budget.
Second, Congress should remove the defense/nondefense “firewall,” which allows special interests to shield their own priorities while disproportionally cutting others. Without the firewall, all discretionary spending would be subject to a single cap, which would force both parties to find more equitable cuts across the board and create more flexibility to stay under the cap each year.
This solution would also reset the current “two for one” discretionary spending trap that takes hostage Congress’ constitutional duty to fund the military.
This omnibus bill was unfortunately the final nail in the coffin for the 2018 budget. It tells the American people that despite politicians’ campaign promises and previous attempts to limit spending, Congress is now putting little effort into solving Washington’s fiscal crisis.
Without meaningful correction, Congress will be poised to eclipse the profligate spending levels of the Obama era, thereby abetting our government’s fiscal decline.

Fiscal restraint is dead in Washington, and no one seems to care.
The March omnibus spending deal follows through on an agreement to spend significantly more over the next two years than any Obama-era spending cap increase. Such a dramatic departure from fiscal sanity is reckless.
The now-certain return of trillion-dollar deficits threatens to undermine Republicans’ most significant legislative accomplishment: tax reform.
Unlike additional government spending, properly designed tax cuts let people keep more of their own money, allow the economy to grow, and lead to higher wages and better economic opportunities.
Tax reform’s promise was simple. American families will send an average of 2,000 fewer dollars to Washington each year—a tax cut for America.
Increased omnibus spending telegraphs the opposite message. Taxes won’t stay low for long.
Federal government spending is more than 20 percent of the U.S. economy, and spending consistently exceeds what the government collects in tax revenue.
This past year, the House, the Senate, and President Donald Trump all proposed budgets that cut spending growth and move the U.S. toward fiscal sanity. Each of these proposals has been successively ignored.
Instead, Congress crafts bipartisan agreements to spend more every year—reviving trillion-dollar deficits and increasing the pace at which the U.S. debt grows.
Without spending cuts, including significant reforms to entitlement spending, tax cuts only serve to make the U.S. fiscal crisis worse. However, a dearth of tax revenue is not the reason Congress has racked up $20 trillion of debt. Washington’s problem is an addiction to spending other people’s money.
Congress’ decision to reduce tax revenue and increase spending at the same time is a recipe for fiscal disaster. In fact, Congress’ new spending is projected to increase over the next 10 years by the same amount it just cut taxes, pushing the difference between revenues and spending even further off balance.
What is often forgotten in the abstract world of budget math is that Washington’s fiscal policy matters to the bottom line of every American. When the IRS takes less of your money, you have more to spend, plow back into your business, or put toward your child’s education or your retirement plan.
The economic benefits of the tax cuts are readily apparent. Unemployment is sustained at a 17-year low, and wages are rising faster than they have since 2009. Indeed, hundreds of businesses have announced raises, bonuses, and new investments directly benefiting millions of Americans.
Don’t count on the good times lasting forever. When legislators are unwilling to address out-of-control spending, they quickly look for new sources of revenue.
Congress and the president are repeating the mistakes of history. Portions of both the Reagan tax cuts in the early 1980s and the Bush tax cuts in the early 2000s were ultimately reversed.
Every American who just received a tax cut should be a newly minted deficit hawk. Without serious spending reforms, your taxes will go back up. Congress made much of the tax cuts temporary. So unless we can reverse course, it is only a matter of time before the taxman comes knocking.
The threat of increased taxes is only the most direct impact of Washington’s opulence. Countries with unsustainable amounts of debt compared to the size of their economy—a group the U.S. is quickly joining—grow at a slower rate.
But a sluggish economic future is avoidable.
Solidified by the recent tax reform, America is in the midst of a prolonged period of economic growth and increasing prosperity. There is no reason the good news has to end. Times of sustained growth are the best time to cut back on spending to correct fiscal imbalances.
But Washington is tempting fate. Lawmakers seem to be testing the limits of economic stability by both cutting taxes and recklessly increasing spending.
If you got a tax cut and want to keep it, you should be clammering for Washington to balance the budget by cutting spending.

"A new proposal in the House Ways and Means Committee to tax electronic cigarettes could harm the health of Americans—and could even be deadly. (Photo:

Adam Michel focuses on tax policy and the federal budget as a policy analyst in the Thomas A. Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies at The Heritage Foundation.
Sin taxes of all types have unintended consequences.
A new
proposal in the House Ways and Means Committee to tax electronic
cigarettes could harm the health of Americans—and could even be deadly. 
The tax will slow the decline in traditional smoking-related
health complications as fewer adults switch to smokeless alternatives that
research has demonstrated to be less harmful. 
The tax will also stimulate the black market and move
the sale of otherwise legal products outside the reach of law enforcement and
health officials. 
The health risks of traditional tobacco cigarettes are well-known. Cigarette use “is the leading preventable cause of death in the United States,” according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
New products such as e-cigarettes are able to deliver nicotine without the chemicals and tar that are most destructive to the human body. Nicotine alone does not cause cancer.  
E-cigarettes don’t have to be 100% risk-free to be a
major improvement over inhaling from the end of what I grew up knowing as
“death sticks.” 
In a comprehensive report, Public Health England concluded
that e-cigarettes are “95% less harmful than tobacco cigarettes” and “have
the potential to help smokers quit.” 
Ninety-five percent is a lot less death.
If Congress is worried about public health, it should be
broadcasting the potential benefits of vaping, rather than taxing and vilifying
the healthier alternative. 
Adult smokers are increasingly switching to less harmful
e-cigarettes. A new tax would slow this progress. Adult smokers are less likely to make the
switch from traditional cigarettes to e-cigarettes after a new
vaping tax is imposed, according to a recent study of new state taxes. 
The tax would be in addition to the Food and Drug Administration’s regulatory obstacles, which pose a threat to the continued existence of many vaping businesses.      
Selective excise taxes also empower the tax-evading
black market, which creates other public health costs.    
The sensationalized stories of vaping-related lung injuries and deaths appear to be linked to non-name brand, black market products, many containing THC, the main psychoactive constituent of marijuana. 
By levying new taxes that would push more people into
the black market, Congress would increase the likelihood of Americans buying unsafe
products.  
As consumers look for untaxed alternates, new tax-induced
black market demand will encourage large-scale criminal enterprises to increase
supply. 
The evidence from traditional cigarette taxes is
instructive. In New York, where the tax rate is the highest
in the nation, more than half the cigarette consumption
is illegal, making otherwise law-abiding citizens into tax-evading
criminals.  
High sin taxes create black markets, which in turn breed crime and unnecessary conflict. For example, a Virginia man hired a contract killer over a cigarette-smuggling dispute, and the altercation that lead to the death of Eric Garner began over untaxed cigarette sales. 
Selective excise taxes almost always have unintended consequences. Soda taxes induce many consumers to switch to beer or replace soda with other high-calorie options. Smokers in high-tax states have been found to smoke cigarettes that are longer and higher in tar and nicotine than smokers in low-tax states. 
Selective taxes imposed on politically disfavored goods tend
to disproportionately hurt the poor. Lower-income consumers spend a larger
share of their incomes on things such as cigarettes and sugary drinks. They are
also more likely to try to evade the tax, increasing their exposure to the
health and legal risks of the black market. 
Most fundamentally, sin taxes, especially federal sin taxes, are antithetical to American freedoms. Not only is the government attempting to manipulate your ability to buy otherwise legal goods, it is raising revenue to further expand the already intrusive federal bureaucracy. 
For better or worse, state governments are already
increasing taxes on e-cigarettes. A new federal tax will impinge on local
authorities’ ability to make the best decisions for their residents. 
Instead of
attempting to manipulate consumer behavior, Congress should work to levy taxes
in the most economically efficient and least market-distorting manner to fund a
limited constitutional government. 
All forms of sin taxes are bad public policy. They
create unintended consequences, rarely address the intended problem, and grow
the size of government. A new federal tax on e-cigarettes would be no
exception.

It’s
no secret that Democrats want to raise taxes on the rich. They are less willing
to admit that their plan would actually raise taxes and shrink economic
opportunity for the middle class. 
Since
the 2017 tax cuts are now two years old, it’s worth revisiting the most
universally agreed upon Democratic proposal to raise your taxes: the Repeal the
2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
Leading
Democrats like Sens. Elizabeth
Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie
Sanders, I-Vt.,
have said they want to roll back the 2017 tax cuts. 
Taking them at their word, what would a repeal of the tax cuts look like for the average American taxpayer?
If
the tax cuts were repealed in 2020, the average American would be $26,906
poorer over the next decade. Taxes would go up and incomes would go down in
every state, every congressional district, and at every income level. The pain
would be felt all across the country. 
Depending
on where you live, the average taxpayer would lose between an estimated $7,660
and $59,633 in take-home pay. A family of four could be between $10,585 and
$101,009 worse off. 
These numbers represent both direct tax increases and slower wage growth from what could easily become a flat-line economy under higher taxes. If you like your higher paycheck, you may not get to keep it.   
>>> How 2 Years of Tax Cuts Have Supported Our Strong Economy
As
Christmas approaches, it’s easy to imagine the lost charity and gifts that
would be stolen by a dramatic tax increase. Income that could have gone to a
local church, spent on daycare expenses, or the down payment on a home would
instead go to government. 
American
taxpayers know how to spend their money better than lawmakers in D.C.
Washington should let them keep it.
Opponents of the tax cuts have claimed that Americans actually didn’t benefit or that most people’s taxes went up. But the numbers don’t lie. Even The New York Times admits that you (probably) got a tax cut. 
Repealing the 2017 tax cuts is not just about taxing American employers at highest-in-the-world rates again. It’s also about raising individual income taxes, cutting the child tax credit in half, shrinking the standard deduction, and curbing new investment for U.S. workers.
And repealing the tax cuts is only part of the left’s tax hike agenda. These figures don’t include the additional losses taxpayers will experience from new and even higher taxes. The left wants to make you pay for misguided and bloated entitlement programs, both old and new.
A favorite punching bag of the left is big business. But let’s consider what these businesses do when they can keep a bit more of their profits: They often reinvest it into new equipment, expand factories, and improve technology. 
These are the things that lead to higher wages and more job openings for American workers. 
In
our current economy, we have more
job openings than people looking for work and the
highest monthly job
openings since December 2000. And a lot of these open
positions are blue-collared
jobs.

Unemployment
has been hovering around 3.5%, which is a 50-year low, and wages are rising
faster than we’ve seen in quite some time, especially for lower-income workers.

This
economy is a boon to lower-earning and middle-class families, enabling more
Americans to experience the meaning and dignity that comes from being able to
support oneself and one’s community through work.  
If the tax cuts are repealed, many of these benefits will disappear. Under the pre-tax reform corporate rate, businesses were moving jobs and capital offshore because domestic taxes were uncompetitive, putting American workers at a disadvantage. 
American
workers are doing well under the tax cuts. But consumers are also doing well.
Consumer confidence remains high, retirement accounts continue to grow with the
stock market, and inflation remains low—all despite the trade war and runaway
federal spending.
Repealing the 2017 tax cuts would mean higher taxes on all Americans, and higher taxes wouldn’t just mean Americans sending more of their paycheck to Washington. It would mean lower wages and more limited job opportunities.  
Instead, lawmakers should focus on making critical provisions of the 2017 tax bill permanent to keep taxes low and solidify future economic opportunities.

"The “Medicare for All” plan revealed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., shows how hard it is to raise tens of trillions of dollars without leaving typical Americans economically worse off. Pictured: Warren speaks Oct. 26 in Florence, South Carolina. (Photo: Sean Rayford/Getty Images)

Adam Michel focuses on tax policy and the federal budget as a policy analyst in the Thomas A. Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies at The Heritage Foundation.
No other country in the world has been
able to provide government-managed health care without soaking middle-class and
lower-income taxpayers with high income and payroll taxes. 
The “Medicare for All” plan revealed
by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., shows how hard it is to raise tens of trillions
of dollars without leaving typical Americans economically worse off. 
Despite the headlines, every single new tax the plan proposes either kneecaps economic opportunity for the American middle class or raises their taxes. 
Here’s what the plan proposes and some
of the well-known problems with each element. 
New Payroll Tax: The largest tax increase would be a new $8.8
trillion payroll tax or mandatory premium payment to approximate what employers
currently pay for health care benefits. 
Although the initial tax is proportional to actual health care spending, over time taxes would equalize to a national average, increasing on employers who have kept health care costs down and rewarding employers who provide more comprehensive benefits. 
When taxes rise on the half of employers below the national average for health care spending, their employees will be worse off, as increasing taxes means slower wage growth.  
Under the plan, big publicly traded businesses with highly paid executives   likely also would pay a higher payroll tax rate to compensate for a temporary preferential rate given to businesses with union contracts. 
The size of the business is also important under the plan. The tax is waived for very small employers, but increases with the size of the business—an incentive not to grow the business or add employees. 
Turning current health care benefits into taxes would create winners and losers at all income levels and businesses sizes. 
More IRS Audits: Upping IRS enforcement as a way to raise new
revenue is not as easy as it sounds. Raising trillions of dollars in taxes from
Americans by having more IRS agents auditing families would increase effective
tax rates. 
A significant portion of the
uncollected “tax gap” is unreported income by independent contractors, tips in
the service industry, and rental income. By and large, these are middle-class
taxpayers. 
Often, rosy projections of new revenue
from more enforcement don’t come to fruition. 
One of the plan’s suggestions is to strengthen
a reporting system for foreign income, which since going into effect likely has
not raised any net revenue. And the cost of
implementing
and complying with the law outstripped even the rosiest initial revenue
projections. 
If it works, more IRS enforcement will
increase taxes on all Americans. If it does not raise revenue, more enforcement
is simply a budget gimmick with high compliance costs. 
Eliminate Expensing: The plan would make it more expensive for
businesses to invest in American workers. By not allowing companies to deduct
the full cost of new investments from their revenues, the plan would make it so
that businesses pay taxes on profits before the profits are earned. 
Eliminating expensing is also a budget
gimmick because it simply makes businesses pay taxes before they should be due,
accelerating revenue collection. 
For businesses, paying taxes on
profits not yet earned makes many investments too costly. This change would
reduce investment, which translates to lower productivity for workers and,
ultimately, smaller wage gains.
Highest-in-the-World Corporate Tax Rate: The plan would raise the federal corporate tax rate back to 35%, the highest rate in the developed world. It also would tax American companies’ worldwide profits, a move that simply would compound the effect of businesses growing and investing less. 
Raising the corporate tax is a
working-class tax hike. Every fiscal authority around the world believes that workers pay a
portion of the corporate tax through lower wages. 
Reasonable estimates show that labor bears more than 75% of the
revenue cost of the corporate tax. 
A highest-in-the-world corporate tax
rate surely would end the current economic expansion, depress new research and
development, and end the current trend of businesses adding new jobs. 
Financial Transactions Tax: A new tax on all sales of bonds, stocks, or
derivatives is not a new idea. The Congressional Budget Office regularly
includes it in its yearly list of budget options.
The CBO’s report warns that the tax could “have a number of negative effects on the economy stemming from its effects on asset prices, the cost of capital for firms, and the frequency of trading.” 
A financial transactions tax would increase rather than decrease
market volatility; it would hurt digital traders, who benefit the market; and it
wouldn’t  raise as much revenue as
projected. 
The tax also would ultimately be paid
by American savers through lower investment returns and fewer economic
opportunities.  
Wealth Tax: A
new annual 6% tax on wealth over $1 billion would hurt every American. The tax
would be a fundamental departure from our current tax code, adding an entirely
new and likely unconstitutional tax system on top of the 70,000 pages of
existing tax law. 
To some, a 6% tax on billionaires may sound like a small fee to pay, but it’s much more than that. A 6% tax on net wealth earning a 5% return is equivalent to an income tax rate of 120%. That’s in addition to existing and proposed taxes on capital gains, profits, and wage income. 
A wealth tax eliminates the incentives
for an innovative, dynamic economy. 
New Capital Gains Taxes: The proposal calls for changing the way we
tax investment income for the highest-income 1% of Americans. 
The proposal would require investors
to pay higher rates on capital gains before the investment is actually sold. So
if the value decreases, the taxes would be levied on phantom profits. 
Called mark-to-market taxation, this
system would be like asking Americans to pay taxes on the estimated increase in
the value of their home, even if they haven’t sold it yet. 
The change “would increase the tax
burden on savers and increase tax code complexity,” according to the Tax Foundation. 
These new taxes are in addition to a multitude of other tax increases Warren has proposed to fund other parts of her agenda. The proposed tax increases would both increase taxes on the middle class and decrease opportunity for all Americans. 
The revenue estimates on which the plan is based are the most optimistic projections available and subject to much debate.  The proposal also relies on spending cuts and health care savings that are unlikely to materialize.   
Taken together, these tax proposals would
dramatically shrink the size of the economy and the incentive to work, save,
and invest. Smaller, less dynamic economies produce much less tax revenue than
those that are growing. 
It is mathematically impossible to pay for large new spending programs with
only tax increases on high-income Americans. Under an expanded government
welfare system, middle-class Americans should expect their taxes to increase
dramatically.

Adam Michel focuses on tax policy and the federal budget as a policy analyst in the Thomas A. Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies at The Heritage Foundation.
America needs a bold agenda to solidify the current economic expansion and return hard-earned money to taxpayers.
That runs counter to the consensus of those on the left, who want large increases in federal spending and dramatic tax increases to pay for them. Their plans are so expansive that it will require both middle-class payroll tax hikes and broad new taxes on American savers, investors, and employers.
Opposing that growth-killing agenda isn’t enough. Conservatives need to draw a stark contrast and push for a second round of tax relief that will let workers keep more of their money, make it easier to save and invest through a universal savings account, and remove the remaining barriers to business investment.
Lower taxes and reduced red tape have helped fuel a middle-class boom. Wages are growing for Americans at every income level—especially among the lowest-income workers. Jobs are plentiful, unemployment is consistently low, and workers are more satisfied and more secure in their jobs than they have been in decades.
But if Congress and President Donald Trump really want to lock in prosperity, they must pursue both lower taxes and smaller government.
Unfortunately, Congress paired the 2017 tax cuts with increased spending. The cuts sparked growth, the spending sparked debt.
Last year, economic growth helped increase federal tax collections by 4%, but spending increased by 8%. That’s a problem.
Tax Reform 2.0 must make the 2017 changes permanent and establish credible, offsetting spending reforms. Each dollar that Washington stops wasting can be plowed into deeper income tax cuts for all taxpaying Americans.
The benefit of tax cuts paired with spending cuts is that the combination is even better for the economy than tax cuts alone. Deficit-financed tax cuts leave a lingering worry that taxes will have to increase again, undermining their potential benefits. As Treasury revenue increases from higher wages and more business activity, those funds can be plowed back into working down the government’s debt and funding subsequent tax cuts.
Universal savings accounts are the conservative alternative to the left’s desire to raise capital gains taxes on American investors. The accounts reduce taxes on savings and help families build financial security through a single, simple, and flexible savings account.
They work like turbocharged retirement savings accounts without the complicated Washington-imposed rules. Ordinary Americans could deposit after-tax income into their savings accounts, and the earnings would grow tax-free.
Universal savings accounts would help lower-income and younger Americans the most. Access to the accounts would allow them to start saving without the complex rules and penalties that currently scare them away from putting money into savings accounts for retirement, health care, and education. Universal savings accounts serve as a sort of on-ramp to retirement savings, something too many Americans delegate to the government to provide.
American employers are also in the crosshairs of the tax-and-spend progressive agenda. The left has proposed some of the highest and most complicated business taxes in the world.
Keeping business taxes low so that American workers remain competitive and wages can keep rising is a good first step. But conservatives can also champion business expensing, an equally important benefit for U.S. workers that provides the foundation for sustained wage growth and long-term productivity gains.
Finishing the 2017 reforms to expensing is the most pro-worker reform Congress could undertake. The reform simply lowers taxes on American businesses’ tangible investments, such as new tools and upgraded machinery.
The last round of reform still excluded the benefit of expensing from certain investments, such as manufacturing floor space and storefronts. Conservatives should champion expensing for all investments to better help American workers compete in a global economy. 
Economic opportunity flourishes when the D.C. swamp is receding. Cutting taxes and restraining spending can solidify and expand the gains Americans currently enjoy.

Last weekend, FedEx became the latest company to face criticism from The New York Times for paying little or nothing in income taxes. 
The Times’ reporting highlights the complexity of who ultimately bears the corporate tax burden and what that means for American workers. 
Following the Sunday report, Frederick W. Smith, chairman
and CEO of FedEx, disputed the accuracy of the
story, and highlighted the importance of business investment for economic
growth and the misleading nature of reporting on isolated annual income tax
payments. 
Smith challenged “A.G. Sulzberger, publisher of the
New York Times, and the business section editor to a public debate in
Washington, D.C.,” to discuss “federal tax policy and the relative societal
benefits of business investments and the enormous intended benefits to the
United States economy, especially lower and middle class wage earners.”
Well, let’s have the debate. 
The Heritage Foundation invites the Times and FedEx to our headquarters in Washington, D.C., for this discussion on corporate taxes, the effects of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and the economic benefits being enjoyed by American workers.
In the spirit of public understanding, we welcome a
co-hosting organization, critical of the benefits of the 2017 tax cuts, to join
us putting on this event. 
In the meantime, let’s get back to why The New York Times’ critique of FedEx and the 2017 tax cuts doesn’t add up.
The Times uses FedEx as an example to support its claim that the tax cuts amounted primarily to a “windfall” for large corporations and investors. It claimed FedEx paid no taxes in 2018 and highlighted recently slow economy-wide investment trends following the 2017 tax cuts. 
It’s misleading to look at just one year of business taxes paid, particularly one immediately following the tax cuts, and despite the claims, investment increased significantly following the reforms, although trade uncertainly has dragged it back down. 
But the Times also missed the larger point—economic research overwhelmingly shows that a majority of the corporate tax is paid by workers through lower wages. So when the corporate tax goes down, wages go up. 
When the economy is humming, as it is today, it is lower-income
and middle-class Americans who benefit the most from rising wages, low
unemployment, and plentiful job opportunities. Pro-growth policies that support
a healthy economy benefit workers the most.   
The Times’ narrative is misleading if readers don’t
fully understand how corporate taxes are calculated and why. 
Our business tax system intentionally taxes profits as
to not discourage firms from hiring new workers or making new investments.
Taxing profits means the system allows firms to deduct costs, such as wages,
investments, rent, etc., from their revenues. 
When a firm expands by hiring new employees, buying new delivery trucks, or growing warehouse capacity, paying no income tax in that year, as FedEx supposedly did, it shows the system working as planned. Businesses see future opportunities and reinvest would-be taxable profits back into their operations and workers. 
Until tax reform, the tax code prohibited businesses from deducting the full cost of a new piece of equipment. Instead, they could only write off a fraction of the cost, spread out over a period of time set by the IRS. 
The 2017 tax cuts allowed more investments to be fully “expensed,” which enabled businesses to immediately write off the full cost. 
Historically, this type of reform leads businesses to increase new investments as the after-tax cost of buying that next truck or computer decreases. The result of the increased investment is a decrease in taxable profits in the immediate term.
Economists expected economy-wide investment to increase following new expensing rules and a lower corporate tax rate, and that’s exactly what happened. 
Immediately following the reforms, business fixed investment, new business applications, and other indicators, such as business confidence, all surpassed expectations, although increasing trade uncertainty and new tariffs in the following year dragged investment back down below pre-tax reform projections. 
It is thus reasonable to conclude the economic costs
of the trade war could have been much worse without the offsetting domestic tax
cuts.
The tax cuts and reforms also were not intended to be a one-time or immediate stimulus. Expensing and lower tax rates are structural reforms, designed to increase investment across the U.S. economy, drive productivity gains, and increase wages over the long run. 
In such a turbulent policy environment, assessing the
success of tax reform will take time as new investment and increased
productivity do not happen instantaneously. 
The Times’ story, and Smith’s reaction, highlight the need for a more thorough understanding of how to honestly evaluate business taxes and their impact on American workers. We welcome the opportunity to continue to shed light on this topic by facilitating further discussions.

Adam Michel focuses on tax policy and the federal budget as a policy analyst in the Thomas A. Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies at The Heritage Foundation.
Senate Democrats are trying to chip away at critical
elements of the 2017 tax cuts.
Included in the 2017 tax cuts is the new $10,000 cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, one of the reform’s signature achievements. The cap advanced the bipartisan goal of treating taxpayers across the income scale more fairly by diminishing the previously unlimited subsidy for high-income taxpayers in high-tax states.
The Senate is set to vote to overturn regulations that are
necessary to implement the cap according to congressional intent. Overturning
the regulations could increase the deficit by more $673 billion over
10 years and encourage high-income taxpayers to avoid taxes and make a profit
in the process. 
The SALT cap was part of the most sweeping update to the
U.S. tax code in more than 30 years, which cut taxes and has allowed the American
economy to continue its longest
economic expansion in recorded history. Undermining the SALT cap would
begin to chip away at the core achievements of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs
Act.  
Senators may be motivated by two misconceptions
about the SALT deduction and the implementing regulations. 
Myth No. 1: The Cap Hurts Middle-Class Taxpayers
Before the 2017 tax cut capped the SALT deduction, 70% of taxpayers received no benefit from it. Most of the benefits flowed to wealthy taxpayers in high-tax states.
Despite the SALT cap, the vast majority of taxpayers still
got a big tax cut for three reasons.
First, the tax law doubled the standard deduction, which
means that about half of the people who previously chose to itemize their taxes
(which allows access to the SALT write-off) now voluntarily choose to take the
new larger standard deduction. Most of these people are better off than they
were before.
Second, tax rates were lowered across the board. Even if
taxable income increased slightly because of the SALT cap, lower tax rates mean
most people still came out ahead.
Third, because the tax law raised the exemption for the ineffective and overly complicated alternative minimum tax (AMT), millions of higher-income AMT-paying taxpayers saw the SALT deduction increase from zero to $10,000 under the new law because they no longer have to pay the AMT. Taxpayers subject to the AMT are not allowed to take the SALT deduction.
If repealing the regulations make the SALT cap unenforceable, it could reduce revenues by $673 billion over 10 years and would primarily benefit wealthy taxpayers at the expense of other taxpayers. 
It would further generate larger deficits and a faster-growing national debt, slowing economic growth, which will hurt lower-income earners through reduced opportunity the most.
Myth No. 2: The Regulations Hurt State-Based Tax Credit Organizations 
To implement the SALT cap as intended by Congress, the
Treasury Department wrote regulations to disallow the use of new state tax
credit schemes set up to game the charitable deduction and circumvent the SALT
cap. 
These new programs would allow savvy taxpayers to artificially
recharacterize their state taxes as charitable donations, which are not subject
to the $10,000 cap.   
Existing legitimate state-based tax credit-supported charities for education choice, environmental protection, and research got unintentionally caught up in the first round of regulations. 
These organizations can offer a state-provided offsetting
tax credit for donations, in effect allowing taxpayers to direct their money to
private charity rather than the government alternatives. 
The glitch in the proposed regulations limited the ability to donate for about 10% of taxpayers—those who chose to itemize but didn’t max out their SALT deduction. 
In the final regulations, Treasury fixed the problem they
caused and reestablished the federal tax system’s neutrality toward state tax
credit programs. Donors who receive an offsetting state tax credit for
contributions to charitable organizations are not subject to new regulatory
limits on the federal SALT deduction, up to the cap of $10,000. 
The regulations also ended the ability for some taxpayers to
actually come out ahead or in one sense “make
money” when they donated to tax credit
organizations. This was a very limited problem before 2017, but the new SALT
cap without the appropriate implementing regulations made the problem much
worse.
By receiving a 100% tax credit for state taxes paid and a federal charitable deduction, a taxpayer could potentially donate $1,000 and receive $1,370 in federal and state tax savings. The current regulations prohibit the unintentional $370 of such federal tax planning strategies.
Whether the charity is legitimate or not, the tax code
should not allow someone to make a profit by donating to a charity.
Repealing the regulations would not only give wealthy
Americans a large and unfair subsidy for their state taxes, but the move would
cut their taxes by even more than the pre-2017 law.

"Like tariffs, the cost of the French tax falls almost entirely on French domestic businesses and consumers. Amazon already has begun to pass the cost on to third-party French sellers. (Photo: Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images)

@adamnmichel

Adam Michel focuses on tax policy and the federal budget as a policy analyst in the Thomas A. Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies at The Heritage Foundation.
In response to a French tax on the revenue of U.S.-based
tech companies, such as Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon, the U.S. is
threatening to put tariffs of up to 100 percent on $2.4 billion of French cheese,
champagne, and other exports. 
The digital tax is already being paid by local French
businesses and consumers through higher prices. Levying retaliatory tariffs on
French imports punishes American families for the misdeeds of the French
government. Instead, the U.S. should simply explain to the French people how
their government is making it more expensive for them to access 21st-century
services. 
The French digital services tax is a 3 percent levy on revenue
from sales of user data, digital advertisements, and online platforms run by
companies with global revenues of more than €750 million ($832 million), of
which at least €25 million comes from French users. 
The revenue thresholds seem to be set to hit primarily American
businesses and exempt most French firms. Global cronyism at its worst.  
Because the French tax targets U.S. and other non-French firms,
it acts as a tariff on imports. Sens.
Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Ron Wyden, D-Ore., accurately described the tax as
“unreasonable, protectionist, and discriminatory.” 
The Treasury Department investigated this tax under Section
301 of the Trade Act of 1974 and found
that the digital services tax “is inconsistent with prevailing principles of
international tax policy, and is unusually burdensome for affected U.S.
companies.” These findings permit the president to respond with reciprocal tariffs.
But the president should not use this authority. 
Like tariffs, the cost of the French tax falls almost
entirely on French domestic businesses and consumers. Amazon already has begun
to pass
the cost on to third-party French sellers. A similar Australian
tax on digital downloads from overseas resulted in higher prices—in some
cases, the price increase was more than the value of the tax. 
Only 5 percent of the French digital services tax will be
paid by the targeted large internet companies, according to a recent
study from Deloitte. More than half will be paid by French consumers
directly, and 40 percent will be paid by local French businesses that use the
taxed digital platforms. 
This tax in France and other similar proposals serve two
goals. 
It leverages populist anti-U.S., anti-big business sentiment
to levy higher domestic taxes on foreign firms. 
And it enables European countries to use the threat of these
new taxes on U.S. firms to coerce the U.S. to be part of the ongoing Organisation
for Economic Cooperation and Development work program to rewrite the international corporate income tax
rules. 
Big-spending, cash-strapped European governments are hungry to
expand their tax bases through the OECD project. This threatens to undermine
longstanding international tax principles that keep taxes low and
facilitate global trade by linking physical business location to taxing power.
If the French succeed at bullying the rest of the world into
these new rules, they will further destabilize
the international tax system and lead to higher taxes on American and other
international businesses, hurting workers and consumers. 
The U.S. should refuse to participate in this process to
abandon the physical-presence requirement for business taxation. Congress
should reject any such plan.  
Both the French tax and the threatened U.S. tariffs harm
businesses and consumers. The president may be legally permitted to levy
retaliatory tariffs—but American consumers would be harmed in the process. 
If France wants to place new taxes on its own citizens, so
be it. America can use our position to explain why such a move is terrible
policy and hurts the French people. But let’s not punish American consumers for
the policy blunders of the French government.

Adam Michel focuses on tax policy and the federal budget as a policy analyst in the Thomas A. Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies at The Heritage Foundation.
This month marks the two-year anniversary of the Tax
Cuts and Jobs Act, the most sweeping update to the U.S. tax code in more than
30 years. 
The reforms simplified the process of paying taxes,
lowered rates on individuals and businesses, and updated the business tax code
so that American corporations and the people they employ can be globally
competitive again.
The tax cuts included a long list of reforms that are
worth reviewing.  
For individuals, the tax cuts reduced federal income tax rates, increased the standard deduction, doubled the child tax credit, repealed the personal and dependent exemptions, and capped the deductions for state and local taxes, among many other reforms. These expire at the end of 2025. 
For businesses, the law permanently lowered the
corporate tax rate to 21%, down from a global high of 35%, and temporarily
allowed businesses to fully deduct most new U.S. investments. 
The tax bill cut taxes for the vast majority of Americans—9 out of every 10 people saw a tax cut or no change in what they paid. 
Using IRS data, The Heritage Foundation found that average households in every congressional district were projected to benefit from a tax cut in 2018. Most Americans received their tax cut through lower employer withholding and thus bigger paychecks. 
The average American was projected to get a $1,400 tax
cut in 2018 and $2,900 for a family of four.
We don’t have to guess anymore about the effects of
the tax cuts. After actually filing their taxes with the
IRS,
Americans saw their average effective tax rates decline by 13% (or about 1.5
percentage points). Despite claims to the contrary, every income group
benefited from the tax cut. 
There were also significant time-savings and simplification. Not every part of the tax code was streamlined, but for most individual taxpayers, taxpaying is now more straightforward. 
In 2017, 30% of households itemized their taxes, a
more complicated process of documenting and calculating a list of discrete
write-offs, such as the mortgage interest and charitable deductions. 
In the first year of the tax cut, itemizers dropped from
30% to 10%, showing that millions of Americans opted for the single, simpler
standard deduction. Under the new system the number of people who were able to
do their own taxes increased
by 4.4%.  
American workers and businesses have been doing better
almost every year since the Great Recession. But the past several years have
been different. Things aren’t just a bit better—we’ve been setting records. 
Unemployment is at a 50-year low of 3.5%. Businesses
have added jobs for 110 straight months, the longest streak on record, and
there are more jobs available than people looking for them. 
Wages have also been increasing. Average wage growth over
the past year was 3.1% in the most recent government data. Non-supervisory and
production worker wages grew even faster, at 3.7%. Before 2018, wage growth
hadn’t reached 3% since 2009. 
The lowest wage earners in the U.S. have been experiencing
some of the largest wage gains. The 10th percentile wage earner (people making
about $12 an hour) have benefited from a 7% wage increase from the third
quarter of 2018 through the same in 2019, in the most recent quarterly
data.
That’s more than twice the gain in average wages and roughly equivalent to a
$1,500 raise for someone earning less than $25,000 a year.
Minorities are also seeing larger than average gains.
Lower-wage black workers have seen wage growth of 8.5%, and similar low-wage
black women workers saw gains larger than 10%. Similar trends can be seen for
low-wage Asian workers, Hispanic women, and people without a high school
degree.   
Between the tax cuts and wage gains, The Heritage
Foundation calculated that over the decade following the tax
cuts, the typical American household will reap an additional $26,000 in
take-home pay or $45,000 for a family of four. That’s more than enough to buy a
new car or put a down payment on a house. 
The American people seem to be internalizing all the
good news. Job satisfaction
and consumer confidence are high. Thanks to the strong economy, Americans who
aren’t happy at their current work are voluntarily leaving their jobs for
better opportunities at close to record rates.
And Americans are saving more too, using the good economic times to prepare for
their future.  
The main way the tax cuts are expected to contribute
to furthering the good economic trends is through increased business
investment, which leads to more jobs, better technology, and eventually
productivity gains. Each of these things helps boost wages. 
Historically, reforms that lower business tax rates
and allow more investment
write-offs lead to increased business activity. Thus, economists
expected economy-wide investment to increase following the reforms, and that’s
exactly what happened. 
It wasn’t until uncertainty regarding trade and tariffs
in the following year dragged investment back down below pre-tax reform
projections. The trade war seems to be hiding the tremendous successes of the
2017 tax cuts. 
Immediately following the reforms, business fixed
investment, new business applications, and other indicators, such as business
confidence, all surpassed expectations.
For example, immediately after the tax cuts were signed into law, business
investment increase by 39%
among the 130 in the S&P 500. 
In such a turbulent policy environment, assessing the
long-term success of tax reform will take time as new investment and increased
productivity do not happen instantaneously. 
The challenge for lawmakers will be to keep taxes low
in the coming years so that the full economic benefits of the 2017 tax cuts can
be enjoyed by generations to come.

Travis Nix is a student at Villanova University and an alumnus of The Heritage Foundation's Young Leaders Program.
Before lawmakers left for August recess, the Democrat-controlled
House voted
to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. 
Such a move would backfire in a major way if passed into law. It would hurt lower-skilled individuals the most, including teenagers, immigrants, and those without a high school degree. And women, who hold more low-wage jobs than men, would be hurt the most, accounting for more than 60% of the resulting lay-offs.
The push for new wage mandates comes at a puzzling
time: We are in the midst of a record economic expansion in which workers in
lower-wage jobs are seeing their wages grow faster than many high-wage workers.

This is no mere blip on the screen. It’s an ongoing
trend, as the July
jobs report shows.

Average wage growth has been above 3% for the last 11
straight months. Meanwhile, the lowest 10th percentile of wage earners ( people
making about $12 an hour) have benefited from more than twice that gain in
wages—a 6.6% wage increase over just the last year. That’s equivalent to a
roughly $1,500 raise for someone earning less than $25,000 a year.
Some are now claiming that minimum wage increases at the state level are responsible. One short study, which was repeated in the pages of The Washington Post, shows that states with minimum wage hikes since 2013 have seen faster wage growth for low-wage workers. 
Not so fast. There are some serious problems with this
study. 
For one, many states that increased their minimum wage also instituted pro-growth reforms during the same time. New York, for example, improved its business climate in 2014 by cutting its corporate tax to its lowest rate since the 1960s. Missouri; Arizona; Washington, D.C.; Minnesota; and Maine are all among the states that cut taxes during this time period while also raising their minimum wage.
There is now ample
evidence that pro-growth policies, like business tax cuts, fuel
wage growth and new hiring. Research on the minimum wage tells the opposite
story: one of job loss and wage stagnation. 
The economic fact is that when the government forces businesses to pay an employee a mandated hourly wage, businesses are left with few options: Cut hours, lay off workers, or reduce benefits—or some combination of these. 
Most often, businesses are forced to cut jobs, which is why the Congressional Budget Office found that raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour could lead to over 3.7 million workers losing their jobs. 
A 2011 study
from The Heritage Foundation painted an even bleaker picture, finding that this
policy would force 7 million Americans out of work.  
Economists have
documented the significant negative impact of Seattle’s decision to raise the minimum wage to
$13 an hour. That decision resulted in a drop in employment across the city.
Workers who retained their jobs ended up working fewer hours, resulting in a net
income loss. 
A similar trend
resulted from Illinois’ 2002 minimum wage hike.
If history is any guide, minimum wage increases lead to slower rather than faster wage growth. 
A 2015 study found that workers in states with small increases in the minimum wage from 2005-2008 ended up with lower wages than they would have had if the state never increased its minimum wage. The minimum wage hike achieved the exact opposite of its goal. 
This happens, in part, because minimum wages shrink
the number of jobs available, meaning there are equally qualified workers competing
for fewer jobs. Workers who are lucky enough to retain their job see slower
wage growth than they would have otherwise because the job market is full of
people who can easily replace them. 
Minimum wages also have been
shown to incentivize
low-income youth to drop out of school, which lowers their future earnings. And,
they cut off employment opportunities entirely for workers who cannot yet
produce the minimum wage. 
At $15 per hour, workers
must be able to produce upward of $35,000 per year. That’s a high bar for
anyone just starting out and especially high for teenagers trying to get their
first job, perhaps to save for college. 
A study on the long-run
effects of minimum wages found that the longer individuals were exposed to
higher minimum wages at young ages, the less they worked and earned by their
late 20s. The study also noted that “the adverse longer-run effects are
stronger for blacks.”
It may be true that some minimum wage hikes raise wages
for a few lucky workers, but it comes at the expense of layoffs and shorter
hours for others.
Workers have much more to
gain from sustainable wage increases, and so do employers and customers, since
both groups want better performance from workers.
Our economy is currently booming, and a key feature of
that is the strong job market. There are now over a million
more jobs available than people looking for work. Employers are
offering wage
increases, bonuses,
new training opportunities, and better
benefits to retain and upskill their best employees. 
Employers are competing for labor. That puts workers
in the driver’s seat, allowing them to demand higher wages and better benefits.
Moreover, productivity is a major leverage point for workers. When workers are more productive, they bring more value to the company and can therefore demand higher wages. 
The current economic environment has benefited from two
things: the 2017 tax cuts and ongoing deregulation. These policies are making
American workers more productive.
The 2017 tax cuts significantly lowered the cost of new
investment by cutting the corporate tax rate and allowing companies to write
off the full cost of many new investments from their taxes. Now, companies have
a greater incentive to re-invest their profits into the tools and research
workers need to be more productive employees. 
And, as workers become more valuable through increased
productivity, they are empowered to demand higher wages. 
But these tax cuts need to be made permanent to ensure workers continue to experience benefits they currently enjoy. 
The United States’ record-long economic expansion has
helped lower-income workers the most, and the whole gamut of pro-growth
policies have helped prolong the current expansion. These gains are impressive
despite the economic uncertainty exacted by President Donald Trump’s tariff
policy and our ever-expanding federal debt, which must
be addressed. 
Congress should not tempt the resilience of the
American economy by mandating a higher federal minimum wage. Lower-wage workers
are feeling a boon like no other in recent memory. The last thing we should do
is bring it to a premature end.

"According to the best estimates, the highest-income Americans already send about half of their earnings to the government.  (Photo: Getty Images)

Adam Michel

@adamnmichel

Adam Michel focuses on tax policy and the federal budget as a policy analyst in the Thomas A. Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies at The Heritage Foundation.
By almost every
measure, the U.S. has one of the most progressive systems of taxation in the
world, in which high-income people pay the highest tax rates.
Everyone agrees on this basic fact, except The New York Times. 
Using data from a new book by Berkeley economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, the Times claims that the tax rate on the highest-income Americans was 23% in 2018, falling below the tax rates of all other income groups. 
To get this result, they had to cook the books, systematically inflating the income of the richest Americans (without also increasing taxes) and leaving out important transfer programs for poor Americans, such as the earned income tax credit, which can more than offset the cost of the payroll tax for some with low incomes. 
The tax code in
America is exceedingly complex, and there is certainly no consensus on the one
best way to measure progressivity or average tax rates. But when you look at
all estimates—from the government, international organizations, left-leaning
think tanks—you can only conclude that the rich do indeed pay more in taxes
than lower-income Americans. In fact, they pay much more. 
The most recent IRS data, from 2016, shows that the top 10% of income earners pay almost 70% of federal income taxes. However, after the estate tax, the federal income tax is the most progressive part of the U.S. tax code. 
Americans also
pay less progressive payroll taxes, corporate taxes, excise taxes, and at the
state level, property and sales taxes. 
Looking at all federal taxes, the Congressional Budget Office shows that the top 1% pay an average federal tax rate of 33.3%. The data shows tax rates decline with income, and the poorest 20% of the population pays an average tax rate of just 1.7%. 
The left-leaning Tax Policy Center shows similar results. 
Just looking at
all federal taxes ignores the effect of state taxes, which tend to be less
progressive, but make up a smaller share of total taxes paid. 
The liberal Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy estimates that combined federal, state, and local taxes are still quite progressive. It finds the top 1% pay a 33.7% tax rate. The poorest 20% of Americans pay an average 20.2% cumulative tax rate. 
The data also show the highest-income taxpayers is the only group that pays a larger share of total taxes than its share of total income. 
While not available
for as many income groups, data from the international Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development show
a similarly progressive combined federal, state, and local tax code.   
The novelty of the Saez-Zucman data is their focus on the households in the top 0.01% and the top 0.0003% (top 400 highest incomes). It is these households, they claim, that have seen the biggest tax cuts over the years. 
Using data
compiled for the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, David Splinter corrects several errors in the Saez-Zucman data.

The adjusted data show the top 0.01% will pay an average federal, state, and local tax rate of 50%, 20 points higher than the Saez-Zucman equivalent estimate. Splinter shows that the bottom income group’s true tax rate is closer to 13 percent, compared with Saez-Zucman’s 20%.
Two of the main assumptions that drive the Saez-Zucman results are a systematic overestimate of unreported (and thus untaxed) income for high-income households and their decision to leave out important subsidy programs that offset taxes paid by people with lower incomes. 
Average tax rates
are estimated by dividing taxes paid by income. Because not all income is
reported to the IRS, official income measures have to be adjusted up, resulting
in a lower effective tax rate. 
Those who work in
restaurants, for example, might not report all their tip income to the
government, and landlords often don’t fully disclose their rents. 
Saez and Zucman assume that households underreport income in proportion to their reported income. IRS audits of actual taxpayers show the opposite. 
The ratio of underreported-to-reported income decreases for higher levels of income. The ratios also change over time. For example, around the time of the 1986 income tax cuts, reported income increased significantly because lower rates increase tax compliance. 
Misallocating
untaxed income makes top earners’ incomes systematically larger than they
actually are, artificially driving down the estimated tax rate. 
For low-income taxpayers, Saez and Zucman leave out refundable tax credits and other means-tested benefit programs that help to offset the cost of payroll, sales, and excise taxes. Specifically, the “refundable” portion of the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit—which are outlays like other welfare spending—can offset almost all of the federal payroll tax for many of the lowest-income workers, especially those with children. 
Since 1990, refundable federal tax credit rates have increased more than 400% for the lowest 20% of households, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Other means-tested transfer programs, such as Medicaid, have also increased substantially over time. 
Researchers can reasonably debate which of these tax and non-tax programs to include when investigating the progressivity of the tax system, but simply including the programs explicitly administered through the tax code flips The New York Times’ narrative upside down. 
There’s a broad
consensus across the ideological spectrum that the U.S. has a highly progressive
tax system. 
Democrats can
still argue for higher taxes on the wealthy, but we need to acknowledge that
according to the best estimates, the highest-income Americans already send about
half of their earnings to the government.

"Sometimes, it feels like we live in Bizarro World,
where everything is the opposite of what we would expect. 
Consider, for example, the regulation of e-cigarettes
and other alternatives to traditional cigarettes. Those who advocate policies
that would help maintain existing levels of cigarette smoking are somehow
viewed as the “righteous.”   
The Tobacco Control Act, which gave the Food and Drug Administration the power to regulate tobacco products, is creating major obstacles for the sale of e-cigarettes and other alternative products, thereby doing more to block cigarette smokers from quitting than allowing them to stop.    This all needs to change.  One of the leading tobacco researchers, the late Michael Russell, famously said, “People smoke for nicotine but they die from the tar.”  It’s the burning of tobacco that releases thousands of harmful chemicals. New products like e-cigarettes reflect this understanding, delivering nicotine without burning tobacco. 
That doesn’t necessarily mean they are safe, but the
research shows that they are less harmful than combustible cigarettes.  
In the most comprehensive government
report of its kind, Public Health England described
e-cigarettes in 2015 as “95% less harmful that tobacco cigarettes.”
  The FDA also recognizes
that these new products are less harmful than combustible cigarettes.
 Yet, the FDA, through its implementation of the Tobacco Control Act, has issued regulations that will effectively put an end to many alternative products that are currently available to smokers.  Specifically, the FDA is requiring these products to go through the costly and burdensome pre-market tobacco-application process. That’s a barrier that, once enforced, will jeopardize the continued existence of many of these products.  Ironically, some e-cigarette opponents irrationally justify their dislike for the products based on a dislike of big tobacco companies.  Yet, the big tobacco companies and other big businesses are the ones that will be able to afford the costly approval process, while the many small businesses in the field will likely cease to exist.  The entire narrative and policy debate around e-cigarettes ignores the critical benefits of these products.  Instead of shouting from the mountaintops that private innovations are now available that can help reduce cigarette smoking, the FDA is using concern over youth usage of e-cigarettes as a way to demonize the products. 
To be clear, the FDA should be concerned
about youth usage of nicotine delivery products; nicotine is addictive and the
safety of these new products still needs to be monitored.  The FDA, however, shouldn’t be using this
concern as a reason to promote policies that would help maintain current levels
of smoking or prevent Americans from having access to products that could save
their lives. Nor should they be diverting attention from the critical
importance of these alternative products.

Underlying this entire narrative is an unfortunate and arguably dangerous
conflating of two very different issues: the harmful and cancer-causing effects
of smoking cigarettes and the harmful effects of nicotine.  Smokers get cancer from the combustion of cigarettes, not the nicotine.  
In fact, data show that about half of American adults incorrectly think nicotine is the main substance in cigarettes that causes
cancer.  Further, American adults increasingly think that using e-cigarettes is as harmful or more harmful than
smoking cigarettes (as high as two-thirds
of adults).

This is a true crisis, arguably caused in large part by government
messaging.  If cigarette smokers don’t
even know that e-cigarettes are less harmful than cigarettes, then they don’t
have much reason to switch.  
So what should Congress do?
Legislators should take immediate action
to eliminate looming regulations that would effectively block the sale of many e-cigarette and
alternative products.  They should also
carefully review how federal agencies are contributing to the misinformation that
exists regarding these products, and take steps to address this problem.  
In addition, Congress should ensure that the FDA reasonably addresses legitimate concerns regarding youth usage of e-cigarettes, without undermining adult access to these products.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of death in the United States.”  E-cigarettes and other alternative products can help change this.  That’s something Congress shouldn’t forget.

"Last week saw a major victory for property rights and an end to another Endangered Species Act horror story. 
The saga began in 2012 when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service determined that 1,544 acres of land in Louisiana was “critical habitat” for an endangered species known as the dusky gopher frog.  
As a result of this designation, the federal
government was considering a ban on the development of the property, depriving
the private property owners of $33.9
million.
The federal government continued to pursue this action even though the dusky gopher frog has not been seen in Louisiana in over 50 years. 
The frog couldn’t even survive on the property. The only way the area could support the frog is if the private property owners make major and costly changes to the property—changes they have said they have no inclination to make nor can they be forced to make.
As the Pacific Legal Foundation’s Mark
Miller, who represented the property owners, recently stated, “The feds may as well have labeled this Louisiana property
critical habitat for a polar bear. It would have done just as much good.”

Unfortunately, in 2016, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held that the government’s actions were permissible. The implications of allowing such an area to be designated “critical habitat” would be sweeping. Judge Priscilla Owen in her dissent argued:
If the Endangered Species Act permitted the actions taken by the government in this case, then vast portions of the United States could be designated as ‘critical habitat’ because it is theoretically possible, even if not probable, that land could be modified to sustain the introduction or reintroduction of an endangered species.
In a unanimous 2018 decision (Justice Brett Kavanaugh did not participate), the Supreme Court rejected the 5th Circuit’s opinion, but didn’t actually answer the question about whether the area was “critical habitat.” Instead, it sent the case back to the 5th Circuit for its review, consistent with the Supreme Court’s opinion.
This included ensuring that the area is “habitat” for the dusky gopher frog before getting into whether it is “critical habitat,” and reviewing whether the federal government’s failure to exclude the area as “critical habitat” was permissible. The Supreme Court held that such exclusions are subject to judicial review.
For the property owners in Louisiana, though, the issue was still very much alive.  
But last week, maybe because the “writing was on the wall,” the Fish and Wildlife Service and the property owners settled the case, with the federal government dropping its efforts to designate the land as critical habitat for the dusky gopher frog.
This entire saga provides yet another example of how the Endangered Species Act and its implementation fail to conserve species while simultaneously hurting property owners.
The federal government wasted resources and attention to achieve an outcome that never would have helped the dusky gopher frog because the habitat wasn’t suitable for its survival. This entire misguided attack on property rights certainly appears more about restricting development than conserving the dusky gopher frog.
After 45 years, it shouldn’t be surprising that lessons have been learned regarding how to modernize and improve the Endangered Species Act and its implementation. Those lessons should be applied, not rejected, in order to save every word of a flawed statute and every misguided interpretation of the law.
This dusky gopher frog saga should serve as one of these important lessons.

"Last July, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that it was going to provide $12 billion in aid to help farmers with the “trade damage” from numerous trade disputes.
That was supposed to be a one-time relief package, but there was little reason at that time to think it would stop with the $12 billion.
Sure enough, less than a year later, the USDA is reportedly going to offer another aid package for farmers that could cost as much as $20 billion.
Like before, this special aid package for farmers is misguided. Here are just three reasons why the USDA shouldn’t move forward with this plan:
1. Compounding one mistake with another. 
The federal government is trying to solve one harmful policy (increasing the tariff rate to 25% on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports that were previously subjected to a 10% tariff, and potentially imposing additional tariffs on $300 billion worth of Chinese goods) with another harmful policy (the aid).  
These tariffs drive up prices for Americans. In fact, the very purpose of tariffs is to make imports more expensive. The additional costs on Chinese imports are largely paid by American importers who then can pass those costs on to consumers.
Another major problem is trade retaliation. In response to U.S. tariffs imposed last year, China retaliated with its own tariffs. The Congressional Research Service explained that China “has levied retaliatory tariffs on about 800 U.S. food and agricultural products that were worth about $20.6 billion in exports to that country in 2017.”
Now there’s the increased U.S. tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports. In response, China announced that it will impose higher tariffs on $60 billion in American goods, including American food and agricultural products. 
The
special aid for farmers only makes matters worse. Taxpayers are now going to be
required to pay as much as $20 billion more to help farmers offset the damage
from the self-inflicted harm caused by tariffs.
These special farm aid “solutions” can lead to a terrible precedent; namely, creating a justification for maintaining and even expanding tariffs, instead of opening up trade opportunities.  
In fact, that appears to be happening now.
2. Inappropriately picking winners and losers. 
Farmers certainly are not winners in these trade disputes, including the trade dispute with China. However, they would be getting favorable treatment over other interests and individuals. 
These trade disputes are hurting far more people than farmers. For example:
In addition to the inappropriate favoritism, this assistance to farmers creates a slippery slope. There is no logical stopping point as to who should receive special aid.
3. Duplicative payments. 
These special aid packages for farmers seem to ignore the fact that the payments are generally duplicative in nature. Taxpayers already provide about $15 billion a year to many agricultural producers, largely to help insulate some producers—inappropriately—from having to compete in the market.  
That
includes triggering payments to producers when they do not meet revenue targets
or when commodity prices decline.
Soybean producers, who are significantly impacted by China’s retaliation, receive about $2 billion a year already to address revenue and price issues from multiple programs, and they receive the third-most farm program support of all commodities.
Regardless
of whether there are tariffs or not, the special aid is a mistake. The U.S.
shouldn’t exacerbate the harm caused by the trade disputes.
U.S.
trade negotiators should remember what President Ronald Reagan said in a
1988 radio address he delivered to the nation:
Over the past 200 years, not only has the argument against tariffs and trade barriers won nearly universal agreement among economists but it has also proven itself in the real world where we have seen free-trading nations prosper while protectionist countries fall behind. 
His powerful words were true then, and they are still true today.

"The Trump administration last month repealed
the Obama administration’s infamous “waters of the United States” rule, by which bureaucrats tried to use the Clean Water Act
to regulate almost every water imaginable.
But this repeal was just the first
step in efforts by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corps of
Engineers to develop a new definition of “waters of the United States,” referred
to as WOTUS, that is consistent with the rule of law. This definition would clarify
what waters may be regulated under the Clean Water Act.
The second step, and the major one, is
expected to take place within the next couple of months: The EPA and Corps will
issue a final rule that includes their new definition.  
The importance of this new rule can’t be overstated. For decades, the EPA and Corps struggled to develop a definition for “waters of the United States” because they consistently sought to expand their power without regard for what the Clean Water Act actually authorizes.  
This overreach directly affects Americans, from farmers plowing land and families seeking to build their dream homes to cities and counties trying to build public safety ditches to help prevent flooding. 
In February, the EPA and Corps
published their proposed
new definition of “waters of the United States.” To the agencies’ credit, they
are doing something different: They actually are trying to respect the rule of
law and the plain language of the Clean Water Act.
They are not including in the
definition, for example, ephemeral waters (dry land
except when it holds water a few days a year after heavy precipitation).
But
this doesn’t mean that the proposed rule is very good. The agencies should make
important changes to the final rule, including: 
1.
Properly Define Traditional Navigable
Waters

Traditional navigable waters are waters that serve as the foundation of the
proposed new definition. Other waters are regulated if they have certain
connections to these traditional navigable waters.

The proposed rule would define traditional
navigable waters as “waters which are
currently used, or were used in the past, or may be susceptible to use in
interstate or foreign commerce … ”  
The problem is this broad definition
would ignore long-standing law, starting with a 1870 Supreme Court case called The Daniel Ball, stressing that traditional navigable waters
must be used or susceptible to use as “highways for commerce,” and “trade and
travel” is or may be conducted  on these
waters.  
The necessary commerce that must take
place on the water is not a stationary activity, such as something
recreational, but instead part of a commercial activity that helps move that
activity along a channel of interstate or foreign commerce.  
It
is therefore critical that the EPA and
Corps clarify that the waters must be used for the transport of commerce.  
The proposed rule also appears to allow waters to be considered traditional navigable waters if they were used in the past for commerce, even if they are not used for commerce now or susceptible to use in commerce.
The final rule should clarify that, at a minimum, any water that is deemed a traditional navigable water must currently be susceptible to use in commerce. 
 2. Exclude Intermittent Waters  The proposed rule would regulate intermittent waters and states that “‘intermittent’ means surface water flowing continuously during certain times of a typical year and more than in direct response to precipitation” (such as when the groundwater table is elevated or when snowpack melts).  
This definition could include
a vast amount of waters, including waters that in many ways might look like
ephemeral waters. 
The Obama rule regulated
too many waters, including waters that generally would be considered land. The
proposed rule appears to have some of the same problems because of this
intermittent definition. 
Justice Antonin Scalia’s plurality opinion in the 2005 Supreme Court case Rapanos v. United States, which addressed the WOTUS definition, excluded intermittent waters. It stressed the importance of waters being “relatively permanent” and “standing or continuously flowing” and also argued that at a bare minimum there must be “the ordinary presence of water.”
It is true that in a footnote to the case, Scalia acknowledged that the plurality of justices wasn’t excluding seasonal rivers such as a stream that has continuous flow for 290 days in a year or waters that dry up in extraordinary circumstance such as drought. 
Any final rule should be consistent with the high court’s plurality opinion in Rapanos and exclude intermittent waters. This would also mean that a seasonal water could be regulated if there is an extraordinary circumstance such as drought or the water has continuous flow, such as the 290-day stream mentioned in the case. 
The continuous flow arguably could be shorter, but it would need to be at least a majority of the year for various reasons, including the need to have the “ordinary presence of water.”   
The Trump administration needs to get the definition of “waters of the United States” right. It isn’t enough merely to get rid of the Obama rule and replace it with a rule that still has many problems.  
The proposed rule was a good start, however, and with significant changes, the final rule can be a win for the rule of law, property owners, and the environment.

"Gabriella Beaumont-Smith

Gabriella Beaumont-Smith is a macroeconomics policy analyst at The Heritage Foundation.
There was some good news Wednesday on the agricultural
trade front. 
The Office of the United States Trade Representative just announced several key provisions of the new U.S.-Japan agreement that would benefit U.S. agricultural producers and American consumers. 
If the agreement goes into effect (the agreement is not yet final), American farmers and ranchers will soon find it easier to export their goods to Japan, the third-largest U.S. agricultural export market in 2018. 
Japan moved up from fourth place, overtaking China, whose rank has gone down as a result of the trade dispute.
According
to the Office of the United States Trade Representative:
Out of the $14.1 billion in U.S. food and agricultural products imported by Japan in 2018, $5.2 billion were already duty free. Under this first-stage initial tariff agreement, Japan will eliminate or reduce tariffs on an additional $7.2 billion of U.S. food and agricultural products.  
For many commodities, the agreement will require Japan to treat U.S. producers equally with producers from other major Japanese trading partners such as the EU, Australia, and Canada. As explained by the American Farm Bureau Federation:
Under the agreement, Japan will place the same level of agricultural tariffs on U.S. goods as it places on CPTPP countries [Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership countries] and the EU. By way of example, the 38.5% tariff on U.S. beef will fall to the 26% placed on beef from Australia, Canada and the EU. Some other foods such as duck, geese, turkey peaches, melons and more would enter duty-free.
However, the agreement doesn’t address improving market access for key U.S. commodities such as rice and soybeans. (Soybeans already enter the Japan market duty-free and rice was not addressed by the agreement.)  Soybeans have been hit especially hard by China’s retaliatory tariffs (soybean exports to China accounted for 57% of total soybean exports in 2017; that number dropped to 18% in 2018). 
However, many commodities such as pork,
vegetables, and dairy that have been significantly impacted by China’s
retaliatory tariffs would benefit from this new agreement with Japan.
For many American farmers and ranchers, agricultural trade is a necessity, since they produce more than they can sell domestically. Free trade makes it possible for them to find customers outside the U.S. for their production and to expand into new markets. This new agreement will help farmers and ranchers better reach the critical Japanese market. 
Agricultural exports, as explained by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, also have significant
economy-wide benefits:
U.S. agricultural exports support output, employment, income, and purchasing power in both the farm and nonfarm sectors. The $134.7 billion of agricultural exports in calendar year 2016 produced an additional $172.1 billion in economic activity for a total economic output of $306.8 billion … Agricultural exports, in 2016, required 1,097,000 full-time civilian jobs, which included 764,000 jobs in the nonfarm sector.
As part of the agreement, the U.S. will also eliminate or reduce tariffs on numerous Japanese imports, including green tea, soy sauce, and chewing gum. The affected import categories had a value of $40 million in 2018. 
Ultimately, this agreement is a good
step forward in helping to liberalize agricultural trade.
This new agreement shows that negotiation can lead to
important results in promoting the freedom to trade.
Trade is often discussed in connection with how it affects countries, but,
as a general matter, trade is truly about the freedom of individuals and
businesses to voluntarily exchange goods and services with customers.
As a general principle, American farmers and ranchers, just like other
businesses, should be free to sell to customers all over the world, including
Japan. Further, consumers should be free to purchase goods and services that
best meet their needs, regardless of national origin. 
Government-imposed barriers, such as tariffs imposed by Japan or the U.S.,
undermine these freedoms. As the U.S. works through trade challenges, this
principle of freedom to trade should be front and center.
According
to the Office of the United States Trade Representative, “President Trump and Prime Minister Abe have agreed
that these early outcomes will be followed by further negotiations to address
remaining areas of interest to each government.” 
More free trade with Japan, including agricultural
trade, shouldn’t end with this agreement.

"The House just passed a massive amnesty bill that would give millions of illegal agricultural workers and their spouses and children a pathway to citizenship.
Proponents of the legislation, known as the Farm Workforce Modernization Act, try to use concerns for farmers and agricultural labor shortages as a pretext for what is first and foremost one of the most extreme illegal immigration bills in recent memory.
Let’s assume for the sake of argument that agricultural labor shortages need to be addressed through the immigration system. Then logically, legislation would focus on how to improve legal pathways for aliens seeking to come to the United States for agricultural work, such as by fixing the H-2A temporary agricultural worker program.
But the bill, through its amnesty provisions, unnecessarily goes way beyond this.
The amnesty plan starts by creating something called “certified agricultural worker status.” If you are working in agriculture and want to stay in the U.S., you are much better off if you are illegally in the country, as opposed to the “suckers” who decided to follow the law. This is because the new certified agricultural worker status is generally only available to illegal agricultural workers.
Once illegal agricultural workers secure certified agricultural worker status, they can stay in the country for at least five and a half years and have begun their pathway to citizenship.
It’s important to recognize that the amnesty provisions are so extreme that they don’t simply allow these illegal workers to change to H-2A status like legal agricultural workers currently in the country. No, they actually get a lot more than that through this special pathway.
Certified agricultural workers can easily renew this special new status on an indefinite basis. They are also eligible to be lawful permanent residents (i.e., get their green cards) in a fairly quick manner.
If the illegal agricultural worker has worked in agriculture for at least 10 years prior to enactment of the law, then they are required to be certified agricultural workers for four years before getting their green cards. If they have not met this 10-year requirement, then they have to be certified agricultural workers for eight years.
To clarify, this doesn’t mean the law requires 14 or 18 years of additional work in agriculture. It only requires four or eight more years of working in agriculture. Then, the illegal agricultural workers can get their green cards and, under existing law, these lawful permanent residents can generally become citizens after five years.
As many of these agricultural workers move to lawful permanent resident status and then to citizenship, there’s no reason to think they would simply continue to work as farmworkers. 
This amnesty plan, which allegedly exists in part to help farmers with their labor needs, would likely have only a limited short-term benefit to farmers as existing workers move off the farm to work in other occupations and in different areas of the country. 
This movement away from the farm is precisely what happened when the United States granted amnesty to more than 1 million agricultural workers in 1986.
The sheer scope of this proposed amnesty would be massive. An estimated 50% to 70% of U.S. farmworkers are in the country illegally. There are likely at least 1.5 million illegal agricultural workers, with estimates above 2 million. This doesn’t even include the spouses and children who would get amnesty as well.
This entire plan rewards those individuals who have illegally come into the country and the agricultural employers who have employed them. There’s also nothing that would do more harm to legal immigration reform than this amnesty, which threatens the legal immigration system’s legitimacy and reason for existing.
After all, any new reforms to the legal immigration system would be severely undermined from the outset because the message of amnesty is clear: Aliens and employers can ignore the legal immigration system when it best serves their needs.
There should be a thoughtful discussion and debate about legal immigration reform, including labor issues within the agricultural sector. The solution is to solve the problems with our laws, not to pass an amnesty law that would bless the actions of aliens and agricultural employers who have ignored the law altogether.

"The Trump administration has just taken an important
step in the effort to protect threatened and endangered species. 
On Monday, the administration published final
regulations that will improve
implementation of the Endangered Species Act. 
This law simply hasn’t worked. Over the law’s more
than 45 years, only about
3%
of the species listed
as threatened or endangered have been removed
from the list due to recovery.
To their credit, the Fish and Wildlife Service and the
National Marine Fisheries Service decided
to take action. They recognized that a significant part of the problem is
connected to how they have implemented the law. 
Here are three of their important changes.
1. No longer treating threatened species as if they were endangered.
The Endangered Species Act applies its most significant protections to species classified
as “endangered,” including very stringent prohibitions against activities that
would harm species or their habitats. This includes severe restrictions on how
private property owners can use their land.
But for threatened species, the Endangered
Species Act’s general rule is that these stringent
prohibitions don’t apply. 
Unfortunately, the Fish and Wildlife Service has
implemented the law in the exact opposite fashion: The general rule is that
these prohibitions do apply to threatened species.
This misguided approach hurts conservation
efforts by diverting time and resources away from where they are most needed.
It also removes important incentives for private property owners. For example,
if the stringent prohibitions didn’t apply to threatened species, private
property owners would have the incentive to protect these species from becoming
endangered in order to avoid these stringent prohibitions.
Fortunately, the final regulations would require the Fish and Wildlife Service to properly follow the law and
treat endangered and threatened species differently from each other. This would
be consistent with what Congress intended and follows what the National Marine Fisheries Service has been doing successfully for years.  
This change would have no impact on
threatened species that have already been listed. This only applies to future
listed species.
2. Promoting much-needed transparency. 
The Endangered Species Act requires that science alone should determine whether to
list a species. The costs of protecting a species has nothing to do with
whether it is endangered or threatened. 
However, the federal government has used this
science-only requirement as an excuse to prohibit the identification of the
benefits and costs of listing a species.
Based on the final regulations, the federal government would
still make listing decisions without considering costs, but would start to
identify and communicate the impacts of these listing decisions.  
There
is nothing novel about informing the public about cost data that isn’t used in
agency decision-making. This is exactly what the Environmental Protection
Agency does when designating the National Ambient Air Quality Standards.
When legislators and the public know what the
actual costs and benefits are for conserving species, they can better
understand the Endangered Species Act and
how existing law might be changed to achieve desired policy outcomes.
3. Stopping critical habitat designations that don’t help to conserve species. 
Under the Endangered Species Act, the federal government designates critical
habitat for listed species, which may include areas that are not occupied by
the species. These unoccupied areas, however, must be essential to the
conservation of the species.  
The new final regulations would help to ensure any unoccupied areas are truly essential, and therefore help to prevent extreme situations, such as what happened in Louisiana.
In that case, the Fish and Wildlife Service determined
that 1,544 acres of land in Louisiana was “critical habitat” for an endangered
species known as the dusky gopher frog. This was despite the fact the
dusky gopher frog has not been seen in Louisiana in over 50 years and couldn’t
even survive on the property. 
As the Pacific Legal Foundation’s Mark Miller,
who represented the property owners in the case, recently stated,
“The feds may as well have labeled this Louisiana property critical habitat for
a polar bear. It would have done just as much good.”
***
The administration’s new final
regulations are designed to better protect species. They may pose a problem for
those who are more interested in blocking development than the welfare of
threatened and endangered species. For those though who want to improve recovery
efforts, these regulations are an important step forward.

"Thursday saw a major win for the rule of law, property rights, and the environment: The Trump administration announced that it had finalized its repeal of President Barack Obama’s infamous 2015 Clean Water Rule.
For decades, the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have struggled to define the Clean Water Act’s term “waters of the United States” in a manner that can pass judicial scrutiny.  
That definition is extremely important, because it clarifies what waters the agencies can regulate under the statute.
Instead of learning from past mistakes, the Obama administration decided it would take the federal overreach to a new level while ignoring the plain language of the Clean Water Act.
There’s a reason why there was such diverse and widespread opposition to this Obama rule: It’s a rule that could have made it very difficult for Americans to engage in even ordinary activities, such as farming or building a home.
The Obama rule
was so extreme it would have regulated waters that couldn’t even be seen by the
naked eye.  
The American Farm
Bureau Federation explained:
…distant regulators using “desktop tools” can conclusively establish the presence of a “tributary” on private lands, even where the human eye can’t see water or any physical channel or evidence of water flow. 
That’s right—invisible tributaries! 
The agencies even claim “tributaries” exist where remote sensing and other desktop tools indicate a prior existence of bed, banks, and [ordinary high-water marks], where these features are no longer present on the landscape today.  
The rule would
have made it possible to regulate “waters” that were, in effect, dry land, such
as a depression in land that holds water a few days a year after heavy
precipitation.
Then there’s the “we will know a regulated water when we see it” aspect of the rule. If waters didn’t fall under specific categories as listed in the rule, then the Obama rule created a backup plan to help ensure the agencies could still have the ability to regulate additional waters.  
>>> Related: EPA Repeals ‘Power Grab’ Water Rule It Says Stifled Innovation
The rule made it
possible for the agencies to regulate some waters on a case-by-case basis if
they decided that the water had a “significant nexus” to certain regulated
waters.  
A property owner
couldn’t have known what this would cover, because such determinations would have
been at the subjective whim of agency officials. 
That’s particularly problematic because the Clean Water Act has both civil and criminal penalties.
The ongoing vagueness problem with the Clean Water Act is a concern that the Supreme Court has repeatedly brought up, including then-Justice Anthony Kennedy, who stated in 2016 in the oral argument for Army Corps of Engineers v. Hawkes Co., “[T]he Clean Water Act is unique in both being quite vague in its reach, arguably unconstitutionally vague, and certainly harsh in the civil and criminal sanctions it puts into practice.”
At the start of
the Clean Water Act, Congress made it clear that it’s “the policy of the Congress
to recognize, preserve, and protect the primary responsibilities and rights of
States to prevent, reduce, and eliminate pollution … .”
The Obama rule ignored this state role. When the federal government tries to regulate every water imaginable, it doesn’t leave much room for states and local governments to address water issues.
Critics will argue that getting rid of this vast federal role in regulating waters will undermine water protection. Congress rejected that argument when it passed the Clean Water Act.
Legislators recognized that states should play the lead role in addressing water pollution. That makes sense, because states are in the best position to address most water issues, and that’s because they are closest to the issues and can develop policy that’s tailored to address specific problems.
The Clean Water
Act regulations are also just one piece in a massive web of laws and programs
that helps to protect surface waters. (In addition to other federal programs
and laws, there is, of course, state and local governments.) 
It should also be
noted that a separate federal law, the Safe Drinking Water Act, protects the
water we drink.
By getting rid of
the Obama rule, the Trump administration appears to recognize the rule’s
numerous problems. Now, it will be up to the Trump administration to develop a
definition of “waters of the United States” that does something unique; namely,
one that follows the law. 
On Feb. 14, the
EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers proposed their new definition, which is a major
improvement from the Obama rule.
There are still improvements that are needed before any new definition is finalized. Justice Antonin Scalia in his plurality opinion in Rapanos v. United States wrestled with many of the challenges that admittedly the agencies face when developing a workable definition of “waters of the United States.”
If the final rule is consistent with this thoughtful opinion, then the Trump administration will succeed where past administrations have failed in developing a workable, legally defensible definition of “waters of the United States.”
Until then, the Trump administration should be commended for getting rid of the Obama rule, which failed on all counts.

"Shouldn’t Environmental Protection Agency regulations do more good than harm?
The agency hasn’t always thought so.
In 2012, under President Barack Obama, the EPA finalized a rule to reduce emissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants from coal- and oil-fired power plants. 
In doing so, the agency decided that it didn’t need to consider the rule’s costs, estimated at $9.6 billion per year—roughly 2,000 times more than its annual benefits of only $4 million to $6 million.
Fortunately, the U.S. Supreme Court directed the agency to take costs into consideration based on specific Clean Air Act language applicable to that rule. If the EPA had its way though, costs wouldn’t have been considered.
That cavalier attitude is evident in other major air regulations, where the EPA didn’t bother to quantify whether there would be any benefits for reducing emissions of the regulated pollutant.
Now, however, there’s reason to hope that some common sense might finally be coming to the EPA.
In May, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler issued a memorandum directing the agency to “ensure that its regulatory decisions are rooted in sound, transparent and consistent approaches to evaluating benefits and costs.”
The full scope of what this process will entail isn’t clear. However, it appears that various offices within the EPA will be proposing rules to codify important principles of cost-benefit analysis into the agency’s work.
The memo explains that “the EPA should evaluate and consider both benefits and costs in decision-making.” The fact that such an obvious point has to be made is sadly instructive.
This entire effort shouldn’t be, and doesn’t appear to be, a scheme to reduce regulations per se. But the need for a reasonable, objective, and predictable way to make regulatory decisions is quite evident.
Regulators shouldn’t be allowed to work backward, deciding what policy they want and then gaming (or ignoring) cost-benefit analysis to reach their preferred policy outcomes. 
By codifying basic regulatory principles through the rule-making process, the EPA will have a more difficult time going back to the “anything goes” mentality that exists now.
There must be a reasonable and transparent process in how the EPA comes up with its regulations. Make no mistake, these EPA regulations have a major impact on the lives of all Americans. 
In addition to environmental objectives, these regulations impact everything from energy costs, infrastructure development, and transportation, to whether a farm includes some dry land that is actually a regulated water under the Clean Water Act.
In moving forward with this process, the EPA should codify basic principles of cost-benefit analysis that have been well-established over the years through various means, including executive orders and Office of Management and Budget documents.
For example, the agency should carefully evaluate to what extent existing regulations or laws contribute to the problem that the agency wants to address. 
The EPA should also evaluate alternatives to regulation and choose an alternative that achieves the regulatory objective while posing the least burden on society.
The EPA should identify where regulations are outdated, duplicative, and unnecessary. Further, unless expressly prohibited in statute, the EPA should assume that cost-benefit analysis is required across the board.
As with the EPA, Congress delegates far too much power to other agencies and is arguably unlawfully delegating its lawmaking power. This is certainly a critical problem that needs to be addressed.
But to the extent agencies are able to exercise this enormous and largely unchecked power, there should be some reasonable rules of the game so that their decision-making is based on sound economic principles. 
This in no way should suggest that cost-benefit analysis is a panacea for sound policymaking, but applying reasonable principles is far better than having none at all.
To its credit, the EPA is taking on this important endeavor to help ensure the agency properly and consistently considers costs and benefits, now and in the future. Other agencies should follow suit.

There is renewed hope for trade
talks with China—a welcome development for the American
economy. But the damage caused by the fight continues. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture is using the situation as an excuse to funnel more taxpayer money to the agricultural industry. It is spending $16 billion on trade aid for farmers affected by the trade fight with China. 
This is on top of the $12 billion in allegedly “one-time” aid provided to farmers last year in response to trade disputes with various countries, including China. 
If this wasn’t bad enough, it now appears the Department of Agriculture plans to use trade aid money to help farmers deal with nontrade-related issues.
Specifically, some farmers who have been unable to plant their cash crops because of inclement weather may be eligible for crop insurance assistance that helps farmers when they are prevented from planting crops. But this does not and should not qualify them for trade aid. 
Enter the “cover crop.” As opposed to primary cash
crops (crops sold for the market) such as corn, wheat, and soybeans, farmers
use cover crops for secondary purposes such as soil health, livestock forage,
or as a backup in case of bad weather. 
The Department of Agriculture has informed farmers who were prevented from planting cash crops, due to the weather, that they still could get some trade aid if they plant cover crops. 
The agency is not only transferring trade assistance money to help with weather-related harm, but it is also influencing planting decisions by encouraging farmers to plant crops they otherwise may not have grown. 
This diversion of trade aid to nontrade-related matters only exacerbates the flawed policy of providing trade aid to farmers in the first place. 
U.S. tariffs imposed on China have inevitably led to retaliatory
tariffs on U.S. goods, including agricultural products. American families are hurt
through higher prices and taxpayers are hurt through paying for the special
trade aid for farmers.
Many industries, not just agriculture, are hurt
through higher costs of imports and lost market opportunities
in China. Yet, the agricultural industry receives preferential treatment even
though farmers already receive
billions of dollars per year in existing crop subsidies.
Even
worse, this special agriculture trade aid also can create a justification for
maintaining and even expanding tariffs, instead of opening up trade
opportunities. In fact, that appears to be happening now.
With the federal government running enormous annual deficits that are partially financed by Chinese purchases of U.S. debt, Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, correctly noted that “[w]e are borrowing money from China to pay our farmers to not sell their crops to China.”
Ultimately, the solution is to end the tariffs and commit to promoting freedom to trade. Until that can be achieved, the Department of Agriculture should stop trade aid and certainly not funnel money to farmers for nontrade-related issues. 
Trade is truly about the freedom of
individuals and businesses, including farmers, to voluntarily exchange goods
and services with customers.
As the U.S. works through trade
challenges with China, this principle of freedom
to trade should be front and center.

"Apple CEO Tim Cook, left, speaks at a technology roundtable hosted by President Donald Trump. (Photo: Carlos Barria/Reuters/Newscom)

One of the problems with tariffs—and there are many—is that well-connected firms regularly win concessions that give them special advantages over others.
Apple, the tech giant, is a perfect example of that phenomenon.
President Donald Trump made an 11th-hour decision to spare the Apple Watch, along with certain other “data-transmission devices,” from the list of $200 billion in Chinese imports subject to tariffs imposed on Sept. 24.
Interestingly, the decision came a week after Apple announced its newest generation of the smartwatch, and almost a month after Apple CEO Tim Cook paid the president a visit at his New Jersey golf club.
In response to the tariffs imposed on Chinese imports, many firms have had to increase prices, reduce investment, or lay off workers.
In fact, Apple stated that its own “concern with these tariffs is that the U.S. will be hardest hit, and that will result in lower growth and competitiveness, and higher prices for U.S. consumers.”
Yet, somehow, Cook won concessions for key Apple products.
This isn’t the first time Cook was able to secure his company an exemption, however.
During the first round of tariff negotiations, in June, the iPhone and other consumer electronics joined the slate of other goods for fresh tariffs. Despite being China’s most valuable export category to the U.S., key electronics (including the iPhone) were notably spared at the last minute.
Not every business has been as lucky as Apple, even though the logic—that tariffs harm domestic consumers and, therefore, domestic companies—surely applies to others.
Trump has said that small-business owners are the “engine of American prosperity,” though his trade policies have been the engineering equivalent of pouring water in the gas tank.
Tariffs place additional burdens on domestic firms, who must pay more for input materials, and in response, must raise prices to their customers.
As is evident with Apple, large companies with political sway have the ability to get key exemptions, while small businesses are left without protection from tariffs’ consequences.
For example, Mid Continent Nail Corp., a nail manufacturer in Poplar Bluff, Missouri, has lost 200 employees, seen a 25 percent increase in costs, and raised prices by 19 percent.
Other small businesses—such as Howard-McCray, Duncanson Growers, Highlands Family Farm, and Schaefer’s—have argued that imports are integral to their businesses and that tariffs have increased their production costs.
Apple is a massive player in the American economy and recently announced major U.S. investments—$350 billion, a new headquarters, and 20,000 jobs—in response to Trump’s tax cuts.
Cook has worked closely with the president and advised him of the disruptions that would result from tariffs on consumer products.
Larry Kudlow, the top White House economic adviser, has described a symbiotic relationship between the Apple CEO and the administration. “He was very helpful in making some suggestions, and I might also add he loves the tax cut and tax reform,” Kudlow told CNBC after an April meeting in the West Wing.
It makes sense, then, that the president would protect Apple and other tech firms from the growth-slowing consequences of his tariffs.
However, many small businesses are losing out because of those reckless policies, as they do not have a line to the president’s ear or the political capital to protect themselves.
Tariffs are an ineffective tool to combat trade abuses because they harm the people at home and disrupt the supply chains that American businesses rely on.
While often referred to as a “protectionist” policy, tariffs in fact expose many small firms to new risks and higher costs of materials.
Apple has effectively dodged tariffs on its products so far, despite being a prime target in Trump’s mission to bring manufacturing back to the U.S.
Apple is no doubt a large player in the economy, and the direct effect of taxing them may be more apparent than taxing a smaller-scale enterprise, such as a Missouri nail manufacturer.
But giving Apple a sweetheart deal while sticking small businesses with the bill represents exactly what’s wrong with cronyism in U.S. politics.

The ongoing U.S.-China trade dispute is threatening
the U.S. economy as a whole, and is hurting
American farmers and ranchers.
In recent years, China has been among the top two largest markets for U.S. agricultural exports. And much more potential for increased exports remains. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has said that “China offers our best opportunity for major export growth in the future.” 
However, in 2018, the U.S. imposed major tariffs on Chinese goods. These U.S. tariffs are a self-inflicted wound on the entire economy, including the agricultural sector, and could limit opportunities in China. The tariffs have created a tit-for-tat situation in which China responded with retaliatory tariffs, making it more difficult for U.S farmers and ranchers to export their products to China. 
The tariffs serve as a tax on a wide range of imported
goods. It is not Chinese businesses, but American businesses that pay for the
tariffs when importing Chinese goods, and then they likely pass the costs on to
their customers. 
The Congressional Research Service has explained
that China “has levied retaliatory tariffs on about 800 U.S. food and agricultural
products that were worth about $20.6 billion in exports to that country in
2017.”
As shown in the table below, China is imposing significant tariffs on important U.S. agricultural exports, such as soybeans (25 percent), many pork products (50 percent for many of these products),and sorghum (25 percent).
The retaliatory tariffs could cause long-term damage to U.S. agricultural exports to China. This is in part due to other countries stepping in to meet Chinese demand and a breakdown in some trading relationships that American farmers and ranchers have already forged in China.  
The American Soybean Association has asserted
that when and if the U.S. rescinds the Section 301 tariffs on China, and China
then lifts its 25 percent retaliatory tariffs, “the process of rebuilding the
U.S. [soybean] market in China could take years.” 
One of the most telling statistics showing the harms
of this trade dispute is the USDA’s current forecast
that in 2019, China will drop from the second-largest to the fifth-largest
agricultural export market for the United States.
To prevent this harm, the United States should act now to eliminate the tariffs. Admittedly, this wouldn’t help the U.S. to address China’s alleged unfair trade practices. But the U.S. can do that by making greater use of the World Trade Organization dispute settlement system. In fact, one of the best features of the World Trade Organization is that it provides a legal venue to challenge foreign trade barriers.
The U.S. has had major success using
the World Trade Organization dispute settlement process in the past. For
example:
The United States government has initiated 29 dispute settlement proceedings over other [World Trade Organization] members’ barriers to U.S. farm exports. The United States achieved a ‘victory’—an affirmative ruling and/or the elimination or modification of the measure at issue—in every single [World Trade Organization] case that moved beyond the first government-to-government ‘consultations’ stage (and even in many of the consultations-only disputes). 
In fact, just
a few weeks ago, the United States won a
major World Trade Organization case against China over improper agricultural
subsidies. 
In 1988, President Ronald Reagan delivered
a radio address to the nation in which he espoused the benefits of free trade:
[O]ne of the key factors behind our nation’s great prosperity is the open trade policy that allows the American people to freely exchange goods and services with free people around the world. … Over the past 200 years, not only has the argument against tariffs and trade barriers won nearly universal agreement among economists, but it has also proven itself in the real world, where we have seen free-trading nations prosper while protectionist countries fall behind.
Reagan’s words were true then, and they remain true today. A commitment to free trade will help the United States as a whole to prosper, and will expand opportunities for the nation’s farmers and ranchers to sell even more of their products around the world.

"The popular method of measuring Chinese GDP inflates China's real economic capacity by roughly 50 percent. (Photo: yongyuan/Getty Images)

Gabriella Beaumont-Smith

Gabriella Beaumont-Smith is a macroeconomics policy analyst at The Heritage Foundation.
China is a rising economic power that will threaten the United States’ place as the world’s biggest economy.
At least, that’s the narrative we’ve become familiar with. But does it really hold up?
Economists use gross domestic product to measure the size and growth of national economies. GDP is based on the real value of what is produced. It’s usually measured by calculating how much money was spent in one country during a single year.
In terms of GDP growth, no country has been hyped up more than China. The World Bank reported that in 2017, China had become the world’s largest economy with a GDP topping $23 trillion. By comparison, United States GDP in 2017 was just over $19 trillion.
Indeed, China’s growth has been impressive. Over the last 25 years, its economy has grown at an average rate of 9.6 percent a year.
But China’s economy still isn’t as big as it’s often advertised, and that’s because a misleading measure is used. The measure is called the purchasing power parity exchange rate. This exchange rate tells us how much money you would need in China to be as wealthy as you are in the United States.
This is not an appropriate way to compare the relative size of countries.
Consider: If you go on vacation to Mexico, you know that things will be cheaper there, so you won’t have to exchange the same amount of dollars that you spend at home in the United States. This allows you to take less money with you, or to treat yourself and buy more than you normally would.
The purchasing power parity exchange rates are an extremely useful way to measure development and predict where a country might aim its GDP to achieve the same living standards as the United States. But to actually compare the sizes of the economies, it is better to use the regular market exchange rates, like you would to change your dollars to another currency.
On this measure, the GDP of China was actually about $14 trillion, not $21 trillion, in 2017. That’s still a huge number, but it’s not as big as the United States, which had a GDP of $19.5 trillion that year.

In practical terms, this means China doesn’t have as great a capacity to spend as is being advertised.
This is especially important to understand when talking about trade.
GDP is an indicator of a country’s economic footprint on the world stage. So, it’s important to understand the extent to which its economic size could disrupt global markets.
When countries trade with one another, they also use market exchange rates to convert to the currencies that they need. For example, when the United States imports from China, China must accept U.S. dollars based on the market exchange rate that you see at your bank.
Similarly for exporters, when the U.S. exports to China, the U.S. has to accept yuan at the market exchange rate.
The inappropriate use of purchasing power parity exchange rates to measure economic capacity has fueled the misconception that China is a giant that threatens the U.S. for economic dominance. This in turn has fueled support for tariffs, which only harm our economy by raising prices for imported goods and raw materials.
The bottom line: China’s economy is large, but by an accurate measure, it’s not yet as big as the U.S. economy. The administration should be wary of threatening China with tariffs. While China is not as powerful as advertised, smooth relations with China are important for our livelihood and national well-being.
As long as the two nations continue trading with each other, both the U.S. and Chinese economies will continue to flourish.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has been one of the strongest and boldest reforms of President Donald Trump’s first term in office. According to analysis from The Heritage Foundation, the tax law will give hardworking Americans tax breaks in every congressional district and in every state.
Across the nation at large, the average American will take home on average $1,400 more of their paycheck in 2018. For married couples with two children, that figure doubles to just under $3,000.
>>> You can find the average tax cut in your district here.
While higher-taxed districts will see more in dollar savings as a result of the tax cuts, they are certainly not the only winners from the Trump tax cuts. In fact, lower-income districts will feel more relief in their tax burden, as they will see a higher percentage of their taxes cut than Americans in higher-income areas.
For example, in New York’s 15th Congressional District, tax filers on average will notice a decrease of over 30 percent in their tax bill in 2018.
All across the country, the manifestations of this policy are quite impressive. Americans are better off from the tax cuts because they get to keep a larger portion of their paychecks. Moreover, the changes in tax rates are providing better economic incentives leading to even higher paychecks.
Lower tax rates mean businesses invest more and consequently demand more labor. Greater labor demand means that businesses hire more workers and increase wages. As a result, American workers get a bigger piece of a bigger economic pie.
As a result, Texas’ 7th Congressional District can expect to see on average $35,000 more in take-home pay over the next 10 years. By the same year, a family of four in Virginia’s 10th Congressional District should enjoy an average of almost $70,000 of their own money back in their pocket. This money can then be spent on daycare, college tuition, or retirement savings, among many others.
Unfortunately, some in Congress have called to undo this tax reform, which would effectively wipe out the benefits of the law. According to our analysis, the cost of repealing the tax cuts in 2020 would be an average of $26,906 in lost income gains over the following 10 years. For a family of four, that cost would be over $45,000.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is allowing Americans in every community across the nation to take home more of their paycheck. Congress should not only keep the law in place but should also work toward making the law permanent well before the its current 2025 “sunset” date.

With the health care debate currently dominating headlines, many Americans may be unaware of a more subtle issue that is affecting the U.S. health care system.
That issue is an increasing shortage of medical professionals. An analysis by the Association of American Medical Colleges estimates that by 2030, America will likely experience a shortage of anywhere between 40,800 and 104,900 physicians.
However, the problem has already gotten worse. As of May 25, the Health Resources and Services Administration had designated over 6,000 areas of the country as having a shortage of primary care providers.
This issue is compounded by the fact that the demand for health care is expected to significantly increase within the next few decades.
A new Heritage Foundation policy paper, co-written by this author (Kevin Dayaratna), describes how changing demographics, an uneven geographic distribution of physicians, and government policy have all contributed to this impending health care crisis.
The report elaborates on the various factors contributing to this crisis:
The Association of American Medical Colleges projects that the number of Americans over the age of 65 will grow by 55 percent by 2030.
As these people age, they will of course need more medical care. Additionally, as a third of physicians may retire in the next decade, they may not be adequately replaced in a manner commensurate with the projected increases in demand.
The physician shortage is particularly striking in rural areas. In fact, the analysts note that “although nearly 20 percent of the country lives in rural areas, fewer than 10 percent of primary care providers practice there.”
Doctors tend to practice near the teaching hospitals where they completed their residency programs, and these hospitals are generally not located in rural areas.
This shortcoming is in part due to the fact that funding for graduate medical education is often “focused on the narrow needs of the teaching hospital rather than the broader health care needs of the population as a whole.”
Graduate medical education, a pre-requisite for medical licensure as well as board certification to practice medicine in the United States, has failed to produce the appropriate supply and distribution of doctors to meet patient demand.
As a result, many of these graduates cannot help treat patients even in areas of the country most desperately in need of care. Each year during the main residency match, there are several thousand medical graduates who do not place into a graduate medical education training position, and thus cannot acquire the training necessary to practice medicine in this country.
The paper offers one possible way for state governments to begin to address the problem of physician shortages—especially shortages in primary care.
That solution is to offer provisional medical licenses to qualified medical school graduates that were not able to attain residency positions to work under the structured supervision of a collaborating physician.
>>> Read the full Heritage Foundation paper here.
Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas, and Utah have already instituted such laws, which can also be significantly improved upon.
Offering provisional licenses to qualified medical graduates could both broaden the opportunities for medical graduates to receive training and help ameliorate the physician shortage.
Given that physician assistants and nurse practitioners currently provide patient care with appropriate supervision, it only makes sense to provide the opportunity for qualified medical graduates to contribute to the health care system through collaboration with practicing physicians.
Innovative solutions such as these could ultimately spawn ideas about alternative training mechanisms that may be better able to respond to the demands of the changing health care marketplace.

Adam Michel focuses on tax policy and the federal budget as a policy analyst in the Thomas A. Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies at The Heritage Foundation.

Rachel Greszler

Rachel Greszler is research fellow in economics, budget, and entitlements in the Grover M. Hermann Center for the Federal Budget, of the Institute for Economic Freedom, at The Heritage Foundation. Read her research.
Since the release of the GOP’s long-awaited tax reform plan, a flurry of commentators have criticized it, saying it is a regressive plan that will raise taxes on a sizable portion of Americans.
What they often fail to mention is that their estimates depend on details of the plan that have yet to be released. As it turns out, different assumptions about those details can dramatically alter the projections of who gets a tax cut under the GOP plan.
For a vast majority of Americans, the main changes they would experience from the plan would be to their income tax rate, the standard deduction, the personal and dependent exemption, and the Child Tax Credit.
So what do we know about how the GOP plan will affect these variables?
1. It would lower individual tax rates. 
The GOP’s framework would lower rates and consolidate tax brackets for individuals. The three new income tax brackets (down from seven) are 12, 25, and 35 percent, but the framework does not specify what the income thresholds will be.
The plan also mentions that an additional fourth top rate may be added.
2. It would double the standard deduction. 
The framework would almost double the standard deduction. It would do so by collapsing the additional standard deduction and personal exemptions into the one larger deduction available to everyone.
For married joint filers the deduction would be $24,000, and for single filers it would be $12,000. This means taxes would become much easier for many people because they won’t need to itemize or check frivolous boxes.
3. It would expand the Child Tax Credit. 
The framework would repeal the personal exemption for dependents, “significantly increase” the Child Tax Credit, and increase the income limits at which the credit currently begins to phase out.
The framework gives no further details on these items.
Taken together, it is still uncertain how these changes will ultimately alter any individual or family’s tax liability. There are other proposed reforms that could also interact with these changes, but that hasn’t stopped commentators from projecting winners and losers.
Other analyses have simply mapped the current tax brackets on to the new rates so that the current 15 percent bracket would now pay 12 percent, the current 25 and 28 percent brackets make up the new 25 percent bracket, and the 33-39.6 percent brackets are consolidated into the 35 percent bracket.
These assumptions are often biased. They keep many Americans paying the same tax rate and actually project an increase in some people’s rate. It’s very unlikely that these conservative lawmakers intend to do that.
If we assume different income thresholds that are entirely reasonable, we find very different results.
One could, for instance, raise the new income thresholds by 15 percent so that more people would pay a lower tax rate. Lower taxes are, after all, a key stated goal of the plan.
Using The Heritage Foundation Individual Income Tax Model, we estimated what these changes—along with the other details released thus far—would mean for taxpayers. In particular, we modeled:
With these three changes, some of our modeled income groups would end up paying slightly more in taxes because the lower rates and higher standard deductions don’t fully compensate for getting rid of the dependent exemption.
But increasing the Child Tax Credit by a modest $100 flips all of our income groups into the black. And that’s even without increasing the credit’s income limits.
Pairing this with the new larger standard deduction and lower tax rates, most families would end up paying less in taxes than they currently do. In fact, every income group would pay a lower tax bill.
Those households with adjusted gross income between $100,000 and $125,000, for example, would see a significant drop in their tax bill of about 6 percent.
Those with adjusted gross income below $50,000 would receive the smallest tax savings because they already pay very little in taxes. However, the Child Tax Credit would likely increase by $500 or more, which would largely benefit this group.
Moreover, other changes to state and local tax deductions and other provisions would likely shift some of the gains for upper-income earners toward middle- and lower-income earners.
(Of course, it is near impossible to enact pro-growth tax reform without some positive benefits for the individuals and small business that pay the majority of taxes, and the top 5 percent of taxpayers pay 60 percent of all federal income taxes.)
These are perfectly reasonable assumptions to make about the details of the GOP plan, given the political promises that have been made. Tax cuts for middle-class Americans are going to be real.
There are also several other possible changes that would alter our analysis, such as eliminating the state and local tax and municipal bond interest deductions (along with some other itemized deductions), creating the newly proposed nonrefundable credit of $500 for non-child dependent care, and nixing the alternative minimum tax.
Regardless of whether these changes occur, the GOP plan makes a huge stride by expanding the standard deduction. Given that 70 percent of Americans already take this deduction, our results show that the GOP plan may very likely result in a tax cut for Americans across the board.

"President Donald Trump on Tuesday issued an “energy independence” executive order on energy and climate policy.
One provision of this order pertains to the social cost of greenhouse gasses—in particular, the “social costs” of carbon, methane, and nitrous oxide. The previous administration had used these social costs to justify its extensive regulatory agenda across the energy sector of the economy.
The Trump administration’s executive order stipulates that the Obama administration’s estimates of these costs should no longer be used for government policy. It also mandates that future cost-benefit analysis take into account the “best available science and economics” and specifically stipulates that recommendations outlined by the Office of Management and Budget be adhered to.
We have discussed these issues extensively in our research at The Heritage Foundation, and the Trump administration should be commended for making these decisions. The social costs of carbon, methane, and nitrous oxide come from a class of statistical models that the Obama administration used to supposedly quantify the economic damages associated with carbon dioxide emissions.

There are three statistical models that are used for estimating these social costs: the DICE model, the FUND model, and the PAGE model.
At The Heritage Foundation, we ran the DICE and FUND models and found them to be inherently unsound for regulatory policy and can be quite easily manipulated by user-selected assumptions. In fact, upon recalculating the social cost of carbon under the DICE model with much more reasonable assumptions, we found that the number arrived at can drop by well over 30 percent.
>>> Read Heritage experts’ analysis of the DICE model. 
In addition to arbitrariness of essential components, their results are based on very questionable assumptions regarding the climate’s sensitivity, naïve projections reaching 300 years into the future, and ignorance of recommendations by the Office of Management and Budget regarding cost-benefit analysis.
We also examined the FUND model. After finding a mistake in the model’s initial specification, we found that it is not only just as sensitive, but can even produce a negative estimate of the social cost of carbon under very reasonable assumptions.
Those assumptions even include regulatory standards currently suggested by the Office of Management and Budget, and which the Energy Independence Act now requires policymakers to adhere to.
>>> Read Heritage experts’ analysis of the FUND model.
Ironically, this negativity would suggest that the government should subsidize, not tax, carbon dioxide emissions.
It became clearly evident that the Obama administration was using these flimsy models to rubber-stamp its environmental agenda and to manipulate and inflate the social cost of carbon.
Beyond the social cost of carbon, we also recently published research on the social costs of methane and nitrous oxide.
>>> Read additional research by Heritage scholars on the social cost of carbon.
We found that the models used for these estimates are also extremely sensitive to very reasonable changes in assumptions. The estimates of the “costs” associated with these greenhouse gases can drop by over 80 percent under different, yet very plausible, assumptions.
Furthermore, evidence shows that the Obama administration’s assumptions regarding climate sensitivity were outdated, and this skewed its calculations regarding the social cost of carbon.
>>> Read Kevin Dayaratna’s testimony before Congress on this subject. 
In additional peer-reviewed research, we found, alongside professor Ross McKitrick of the University of Guelph, that more up-to-date assumptions regarding climate sensitivity make it possible to take into account proper interactions regarding the oceans, which if not properly accounted for, can artificially inflate the social cost of carbon.
>>> See Heritage experts’ peer-reviewed research on this subject.
While these models may be interesting academically, because they are so sensitive to very reasonable changes in assumptions, they can be easily manipulated by policymakers, regulators, and bureaucrats. As a result, they can form the basis for potentially burdensome energy regulations.
Trump’s newly signed executive order is thoroughly informed by the analyses described above. The administration should be strongly commended for recognizing the flawed nature of these old models, and for rescinding the Obama administration’s estimates of the social cost of greenhouse gases.

"If someone asked you to describe the Green New Deal, what would you say?
According to Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., it’s a “bold idea” that would “create millions of good-paying jobs” and help “rebuild communities in rural America that have been devastated.”
Oh, you thought the Green New Deal was all about fighting climate change? Well, think again. 
Turns out it’s a green-glossed Trojan horse designed to increase government control over the economy.
Just ask Saikat Chakrabarti, chief of staff to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., the author of the deal. “The interesting thing about the Green New Deal is it wasn’t originally a climate thing at all,” Chakrabarti said. “We really think of it as a how-do-you-change-the-entire-economy thing.”
Just how much change would the Green New Deal bring to the economy? Put simply, it would bring it to its knees.
We know, because when we tried to use the Energy Information Administration’s National Energy Model to assess how the plan would affect the economy, the model crashed.
The Green New Deal is big on vision, but sparse on details. For example, it calls for reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 60% below 2010 levels by 2030, with the ultimate goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. But it doesn’t say how to get there.
One thing is clear: to meet these goals, Washington would have to force all Americans to reduce their energy consumption and/or switch to “green” energy sources—and fast. And the only way to do that is to impose coercive taxes and regulations.
To assess the economic effects of such a scheme, we started by looking at a carbon tax—the most popular recommendation of those asking government to “nudge” us off of fossil fuels.
Using the Energy Information Administration’s model, we tested to see how high a carbon tax would have to go to meet the Green New Deal’s emission targets. We ratcheted the tax up to $300 per ton, which dropped emissions 58% below 2010 levels—but not until 2050.
That left us far short of reaching the deal’s targets, but when we tried to push the tax higher, the model crashed. Clearly, the Green New Deal’s emission targets are unrealistic. Yet the danger they pose to the economy are far too real.
Before the model’s lights went out, we found that a $300 per ton carbon tax and associated regulations would cost a family of four nearly $8,000 per year in income lost to higher energy costs, consumer prices, and foregone wages. The 20-year cost totals $165,000.
During that same 20-year period, the tax would siphon off an average of 1.1 million jobs per year and diminish gross domestic product by a total of more than $15 trillion.
That’s a hefty price to pay for getting barely halfway to the net-zero emissions goal. Is it worth it? After all, proponents of eliminating conventional fuels argue that the cost of climate change dwarfs the cost of climate policy. 
However, in terms of “climate insurance,” eliminating greenhouse gas emissions doesn’t get you very far.
To see if this is true, we turned to another tool: the Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse Gas Induced Climate Change. Developed at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, this model assesses how much increases and decreases in greenhouse gas trajectories will affect global temperatures and sea levels.
Running this model, we found that overhauling America’s economy—as envisioned in the Green New Deal—would abate global warming by approximately 0.2 degree Celsius by the year 2100. The reduction in sea-level rise would be less than 2 centimeters.
In other words, the Green New Deal offers minimal climate improvement at impossibly high prices.
Chakrabarti is spot on. The Green New Deal isn’t a “climate thing” at all. And it would certainly change the economy—for the worse.

"Implementing the Green New Deal resolution would place significant though hard-to-quantify costs on Americans, according to a preliminary analysis by The Heritage Foundation that hints at the total burden.
Granted, generating a cost estimate for a plan that is nebulously defined and lacks specificity is a challenge, especially when technologies to achieve those goals simply do not exist. 
Is the model supposed to assume that all-electric 18-wheelers become the new norm, for example? 
In other instances, the Green New Deal resolution, which is nonbinding, adds vague language such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions “as much as technologically feasible.” 
But that doesn’t help much when modeling costs, either.  
It’s technically feasible to ground airplanes, close factories, and shut down oil pipelines. But that doesn’t mean an energy model can account for such a fantastical green dream. 
Instead, to provide a broad estimate of just a fraction of
what the Green New Deal would cost, Heritage analysts modeled implementation of
a $54 carbon tax, phased in by 2021. 
Although the Green New Deal as proposed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., does not explicitly call for a carbon tax, Heritage’s analysis demonstrates the economic sacrifices all Americans would make to achieve just a fraction of the emission reductions desired.
The changes modeled in Heritage’s report are projected to reduce
greenhouse gases by slightly less than 30 percent by the middle of the century,
merely a small portion of the emissions reductions envisioned in the Green New
Deal resolution.  
The Green New Deal aims
to achieve 40 percent to 60 percent global reductions in man-made greenhouse
gases from 2010 levels by
2030, and net zero emissions by 2050. 
The plan inherently would
change how people produce energy, harvest crops, raise livestock, build homes,
drive cars, and manufacture goods. A few of the policy’s top-line goals are to
derive 100 percent of America’s electricity from “clean, renewable, and
zero-emission” energy sources.  
The plan calls for
eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from transportation, manufacturing,
agricultural, and other industrial sectors to the extent it is technologically
feasible. 
In addition, the resolution proposes to spend massively on clean energy manufacturing and renewable energy manufacturing. 
To provide a glimpse into the broad costs on these industries, Heritage analysts implement an economy-wide carbon tax. In future analyses, we aim to implement higher carbon taxes to realize greater emissions reductions to the extent that the model recognizes such changes as technologically feasible.
1.4 Million Jobs Lost, $3.9 Trillion
Hit to Economy 
As
mentioned
in a FAQ sheet attributed to Ocasio-Cortez’s office, “a carbon tax
would be a tiny part of a Green New Deal.” Nevertheless, modeling a “tiny part”
and showing the high costs of that “tiny part” demonstrate just how
economically devastating the Green New Deal would be. 
Our tax begins in 2020 at $27 per ton of carbon dioxide emissions, increases to $54 the following year, and subsequently increases annually by 2.5 percent. In our simulations, we rebate the revenue collected from the tax back to consumers.  
In
addition, we included carbon-based regulations on the manufacturing industry as
well as mandates requiring the country to use significantly more renewable
forms of energy than current projections. To quantify the economic impact of
the Green New Deal, we used the Heritage Energy Model, a derivative of the Energy Information
Administration’s National Energy Modeling System. 
According
to the Heritage Energy Model, as a result of the taxes and carbon-based
regulations, by 2040 one can expect:  
Unquestionably, these projections from the
Heritage Energy Model significantly underestimate the costs of the Green New
Deal’s energy components. As Ocasio-Cortez’s Frequently Asked Questions sheet notes,
the carbon tax is only one of many policy tools Green New Deal advocates hope
to implement. 
In the same FAQ sheet, Ocasio-Cortez’s office argues that massive amounts of spending are necessary—and “government is best placed to be the prime driver.” In other words, the resolution’s co-sponsors expect the taxpayers to pay for a massive, economy-wide transition. 
If policymakers spent, taxed, and
regulated to achieve greenhouse gas-neutral energy, agricultural, and
industrial sectors, the costs would be several orders of magnitude higher than
those projected in the Heritage report. 
Green
New Deal Barely Would Affect Climate 
Proponents of a carbon tax and the Green
New Deal argue that these policies are a form of insurance against a changing
climate. The cost of inaction, they purport, is much greater than any policies
that drive energy prices higher. 
However, the reality is these policies do
not actually provide any “climate insurance.” No matter where one stands on the
urgency to combat climate change, the Green New Deal policies would be
ineffective in abating temperature increases and slowing the rise of sea levels.
In fact, the U.S. could cut its carbon dioxide emissions by 100 percent and it
would not make a difference in global warming. 
According to the Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse Gas Induced Climate Change, using a climate sensitivity of 4.5 degrees Celsius (the warming effect of a doubling of carbon dioxide emissions and an estimate exceeding recent research on the topic), the world would be less than 0.2 degree Celsius cooler by 2100. The rise of sea levels would be reduced by less than 2 centimeters.
Same Old Tax-and-Spend
Cronyism
The Green New Deal is not just an energy and
climate policy: It is a plan to fundamentally transform the economy. 
A Green New Deal as outlined by Ocasio-Cortez
would be fiscally and economically catastrophic for American families and
businesses—all for no meaningful climate benefit. 
The plan is far from new and would introduce
a completely new level of cronyism and corporate welfare that would harm Americans
all across the country.

"As the struggle to repeal and replace Obamacare with a plan that will decrease fast-rising and exorbitant premiums as well as increasing consumer choice rages on, another health care crisis looms.
Americans are facing an increasing shortage of primary care physicians, and the problem is only expected to get worse over the next 10 years.
Imagine a world where everyone has to travel hours to find a doctor who is able to provide treatment and lifesaving medicine. Imagine having a child fall ill, but the nearest pediatrician being many miles away.
This shortage is already affecting communities nationwide. Many have begun to lack much-needed medical services, and this pressure is most deeply felt in rural communities.
The coming crisis has multiple causes, one being the aging pool of physicians. As older physicians begin to retire over the next decade, the number of physicians will drop. By 2030 there will be a shortage of as many as 104,900 physicians.
Part of this problem stems from the fact that medical residency programs—a training requirement that is a prerequisite for becoming a board-certified physician—are not churning out new doctors at a sufficient rate.
The physician shortage problem is so bad that some states, like Missouri, have decided to bypass the residency requirement in order to attract medical graduates who are not able to participate in residency training programs.
Under the supervision of a fully licensed physician, these graduates are to be given some form of provisional license, which would allow them to practice medicine for a limited time without a residency.
Many of these medical graduates are highly trained and educated, having passed the United States Medical Licensing Exams.
Given that nurse practitioners and physician assistants are already given a significant amount of autonomy, allowing these graduates to practice in some capacity can only help curb the rising physician shortage.
Longer-term solutions should also involve fundamentally reforming graduate medical education. One such potential solution has been discussed at length by Heritage Foundation senior fellow and practicing surgeon Dr. John O’Shea.
Health care is a critical issue for all Americans. As we move forward in the process of reforming our overall health care system, we must not forget the doctors who actually provide the care.
Until we give American doctors more freedom to practice medicine across the country, the current restrictions will only continue to reduce access to care for the ordinary Americans politicians are trying to help.

Adam Michel focuses on tax policy and the federal budget as a policy analyst in the Thomas A. Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies at The Heritage Foundation.
Congress is set to unveil more details of its tax reform proposal this week, and many people fear that the death tax—also known as the estate tax and related gift taxes—will not be fully repealed.
Not repealing the death tax would literally be economic malpractice. The tax is a burden on family-owned businesses, slows economic growth, and contributes to large compliance burdens. It’s a costly burden that families often plan around.
Politically, repeal of the death tax is even more of a no-brainer. No one likes the death tax. Killing it enjoys bipartisan support.
The death tax is a 40 percent tax on the assets that one leaves behind after death above $5.45 million. It is intended to prevent the accumulation of wealth across generations.
Unfortunately, the tax has the unintended consequence of stifling economic growth.
The largest estates are often those that include family-owned businesses. Family businesses appear valuable on paper, but it’s hard to pay a 40 percent tax on the value of your farm equipment without selling it or taking out a huge loan.
You may have heard that less than 5,000 people pay the estate tax each year, so proponents of the tax will claim it has no measurable effect on businesses or the economy.
What proponents fail to recognize is that the tax incentivizes business owners to close or sell their companies before they die, spending down their investments rather than working to maintain their business for future generations.
This practice hurts the economy because family-owned businesses are often hard to transfer to unrelated third parties. Forcing this transfer results in less business investment, which is ultimately what will create jobs, raise wages, and grow the economy.
In fact, a Heritage Foundation study estimated that eliminating the death tax would result in an average of 18,000 private-sector jobs annually and would boost U.S. economic growth by more than $46 billion over 10 years due to increased investment.
Perhaps most perversely, however, the tax falls most heavily on those businesses and individuals who do not hire professional estate planners to minimize or entirely escape the tax.
The National Taxpayers Union estimates the death tax requires nearly 2.1 million hours of compliance time a year, which costs over $100 million, resulting in costs of nearly $10,000 per filer.
For an annual cost of billions of dollars of forgone economic output and millions of dollars of direct compliance costs, what are the purported benefits that people claim?
Naively, some people may believe that the death tax can help to address income inequality. Although income inequality has been shown not to impede opportunity, only a minuscule fraction (around 2 percent) of such inequality can even be attributed to inherited wealth in the first place. As a result, even if we taxed every penny of every estate, the tax would have little impact.
Other proponents hail the supposed revenue the death tax brings into Washington’s coffers. In reality, though, it accounts for less than 1 percent of all federal revenues.
According to the Tax Foundation, repealing the tax would only cost the federal government $19 billion over 10 years when taking into account the economic growth that would result. However, even this dynamic estimate still overstates the revenue loss because taxpayers currently give assets to relatives in lower-income tax brackets to avoid the tax.
Removing the estate tax could actually bring in more revenue if assets are not shifted to relatives prematurely and thus taxed at the higher-income bracket of the estate owner.
Despite the economic damage wrought by the estate tax, there is a more compelling reason for Congress to repeal it: The estate tax is redundant.
The estate tax is a second and often third layer of tax on income that is already subject to federal taxes. This last layer of tax is foisted on families at their most vulnerable time—when they have lost a loved one.
An American’s death should not be a taxable event.
As part of tax reform, Washington lawmakers would do well to kill the death tax immediately.

"What would you buy with $26,000? A new car? A year of college tuition? A down payment on a house?
This is not a hypothetical question. New research from The Heritage Foundation shows that the average American household can expect about $26,000 more in take-home pay over the next 10 years thanks to the tax reform that Congress passed last year.
But where can you find the “average” American? With Heritage’s new online tool, you can see how the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will benefit the typical taxpayer in every congressional district. We’ve tailored our research to where you live. (Check it out here.)
The big takeaway? Wherever you live, typical taxpayers in every congressional district will see a tax cut in 2018.
You may have noticed this phenomenon already as your employer has started deducting less from your paycheck this year. The average American household can expect to pay about $1,400 less in taxes in 2018. But depending on where you live and how many kids you have, the numbers can look different.
In communities that had high tax bills last year, such as Palo Alto, California’s district (CA-18) represented in the House by Anna Eshoo, or one of New York City’s Manhattan districts (NY-12) represented by Carolyn Maloney, the average tax cut could be as much as $3,000.
Lower-income communities, such as areas near Phoenix, Arizona, (AZ-7) represented in the House by Ruben Gallego, as well as Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (PA-2), will see much larger percentage decreases in their tax bills. Tax reform benefited these communities by cutting their income taxes on average by 18 percent or more.
Moreover, Americans with children will benefit tremendously from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. A married couple filing jointly with two children will see their tax bills fall by $2,917.
The tax cuts, however, will have much larger effects than just letting Americans keep more of their money. Since tax reform passed, more than 600 companies have announced more jobs, more bonuses, higher wages, charitable giving, and new investments in the U.S. Many of them explicitly cited the tax cuts as the reason for the bonuses and investments.
Businesses are in the midst of the longest-running trend of adding jobs to the U.S. economy in our history.
In the coming years, the tax cuts will continue to raise wages, increase investment, and expand economic opportunities. Americans will in fact benefit twice from the tax cuts—once from paying less in taxes, and again from higher pre-tax incomes.
But this future is not certain. Many of the tax cuts expire after 2025, and some in Congress are determined to repeal them well before then. If the tax cuts are made permanent, our estimates suggest take-home pay after 2025 would be about 1 percent higher, corresponding to $600 per year for someone making the median U.S. income.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is fundamentally important for Americans all across the country. It’s time to protect our paychecks and our financial well-being by telling Congress to make our tax cuts permanent.

"Climate change soon will constitute “a global catastrophe
costing millions of lives in wars and natural disasters,” one government study
predicted.
By 2020, according
to a report on the study in The Guardian, “abrupt climate change could
bring the planet to the edge of anarchy as countries develop a nuclear threat
to defend and secure dwindling food, water and energy supplies.”
That was 16 years ago. Now that the year 2020 is upon us, are any of these “doom and gloom” scenarios actually occurring? Far from it.  
Indeed, the planet has experienced a bit of lukewarming. However, claims of increases in extreme weather are vastly overstated. 
If anything, societies have been able to grow wealthier over time, and, as a result, have been more capable of weathering the extreme events that have come their way. 
In fact, here at home, the economy is thriving. Unemployment remains at historical lows. And by achieving energy independence, we have transformed the global energy landscape. 
So where did all this alarmist rhetoric come from? Well, faulty computer modeling is a big part of the explanation. Computer models are sometimes based on assumptions that have been beefed up to satisfy a particular regulatory agenda.
This is part of a new study I
published in the peer-reviewed journal Environmental
Economics and Policy Studies with Ross McKitrick of the University of
Guelph, Ontario, and Pat
Michaels of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a free-market think tank.  
The study examined some of the assumptions made in one model
used to estimate the economic effects of climate change. Called the FUND model, it is used to estimate a
construct known as the social cost of carbon, which refers to the economic
damages associated with carbon dioxide emissions over a particular time
horizon.   
Unlike other models the government has used before, however,
the FUND model actually incorporates benefits of carbon dioxide emissions into
its modeling.  
All of these computer models are based on assumptions. In
this study, we focused on assumptions regarding climate
sensitivity as well as agricultural benefits.  
Although it long has been understood that carbon dioxide emissions affect temperatures, the question is to what degree (pun intended). We found that updating these assumptions in line with more recent research can have a significant effect on the social cost of carbon.   
In fact, under some realistic scenarios of moderate warming,
we found that the social cost of carbon is essentially zero and might even be
negative. That’s right: The benefits associated with a moderate amount of
warming may outweigh the costs. Typically, such benefits result from longer
growing seasons and increased agricultural output.   
Bottom line: The FUND model, under very reasonable assumptions, indicates that a moderate amount of warming has practically no negative impact and might even be a good thing.  
This study is just one of many in a stream of research on
the social cost of carbon published by The Heritage Foundation’s Center for
Data Analysis. My prior research with colleagues demonstrated that the computer
models used to estimate the economic impact of climate change are extremely
sensitive to reasonable changes in other assumptions as well. 
These assumptions include foolish attempts to make
projections 300 years into the future and ignorance of recommendations
by the Office of Management and Budget regarding cost-benefit analysis.
In our research, we varied these assumptions by altering the model’s projections in a more reasonable manner, incorporating the OMB’s recommendations for this type of analysis and updating assumptions regarding climate sensitivity.  We found that tweaking these assumptions can reduce the social cost of carbon by as much as 80% or more compared to estimates made by the Obama administration.  
Our conclusion: The Obama administration deliberately beefed up estimates of the social cost of carbon to justify its policy agenda. Ever since, Heritage has advocated that these computer models are so prone to user manipulation that it is not only naïve but dangerous to put them in the hands of lawmakers, regulators, and bureaucrats:
 —Heritage’s analysis of the DICE model, also used to estimate the social cost of carbon. 
 —Heritage’s analysis of the FUND model.
 —Heritage’s other peer-reviewed analysis of these computer models.
This work has been recognized by Congress as well as both the Obama and Trump administrations.
Yes, statistical models can be useful for understanding real-world phenomena. 
Any model, however, is only as a good as the assumptions from which it is composed. Improperly specified models can deceive the public, misguide policymakers, and result in big costs for ordinary Americans.

"""The proposed bailouts do nothing to penalize plans for their past recklessness and nothing to impose proper funding requirements going forward,"" writes Rachel Greszler. (Photo: Nodar Chernishev/EyeEm/Getty Images)

On Oct. 31, the
national debt hit $23 trillion. That’s equivalent to a credit card bill of
$178,000 for every household in America.
This marks an enormous increase. Even after adjusting for inflation, it’s a jump of $60,000 over just 10 years for the average household. 
In other words, even after accounting for inflation, the U.S. added more debt per household over the past 10 years than it did over its first 200 years.
Low interest rates today make our debt seemingly manageable, but the higher America’s debt grows, the more likely it is that rates could suddenly spike, sending terrible shocks throughout the economy. 
Now, an obscure
pension “fix” could hasten such a shock by opening the door to massive pension bailouts
that could push our $23 trillion debt closer to $30 trillion, or $230,000 per
household.
Unbeknownst to
most Americans, Congress is considering legislation to “fix” underfunded
private union pension plans that have promised at least $638
billion more in pension
benefits than they’ve set aside to pay. 
The “fix” that
mismanaged pension plans have lobbied Congress for is to shift those broken
promises onto taxpayers. Politicians who receive hefty donations from unions, along
with some lawmakers who have lots of constituents that would benefit from a
taxpayer bailout, are pushing for just that—a massive bailout without reform.
Because the proposed bailouts do nothing to penalize plans for their
past recklessness and nothing to impose proper funding requirements going
forward, those plans’ unfunded obligations would only rise further. 
But this time, it
would be on the taxpayers’ dime.
Worse, if Congress
bails out private union pension plans, how will it say no to teachers, police,
and firefighters who come to the federal government asking for a bailout of
their state and local pensions that have an estimated $4 trillion to $6 trillion in unfunded pension promises? 
Tacking as much as $6.7 trillion onto our national debt to cover broken pension promises would raise the average household’s debt burden by $52,000, to $230,000.
And that would come before Congress tackles Social Security’s $13.9 trillion shortfall that would require an additional $108,000 per household to fix. 
All told, the current deficit plus Social Security’s and private and public pension plans’ shortfalls would amount to about $338,000 in debt for the average household.
That’s more than five times
the median household’s income.   
America’s debt already threatens our freedom and prosperity. Unfairly forcing taxpayers to take on the broken pension promises of private and public sector unions would raise that threat level.
Congress should help
alleviate and prevent pension shortfalls—but not through taxpayer bailouts. 
First, policymakers must tackle Social Security’s unfunded promises by updating the program and better focusing benefits on those who need them most.
Doing so would prevent massive tax increases—an additional $1,000 to $2,000 per year for middle-class households—on workers.
Congress should then address pension underfunding by maintaining the solvency of its pension insurance program and by enforcing proper funding rules to hold employers and unions liable for the benefits they promise.

"Under the Worker's Choice Act, employees would be free to negotiate directly with their employer or to choose a representative outside the union.  (Photo: Stock/Getty Images)

Rachel Greszler

Rachel Greszler is research fellow in economics, budget, and entitlements in the Grover M. Hermann Center for the Federal Budget, of the Institute for Economic Freedom, at The Heritage Foundation. Read her research.
Imagine that a
charge was brought against you and you had to appear in court. Now, imagine
that instead of having the choices of representing yourself, hiring an attorney
of your choice, or being represented by a public defender, you were required to
use an appointed public defender. 
And now, imagine
that the public defender assigned to you had polar-opposite political views
than yours and that your voting and opinions were fully disclosed to that
public defender. 
That’s the case today for employees in unionized workplaces. 
Even if the workers have the option not to join the union (because they live in a right-to-work state or are a public employee), they nevertheless cannot be represented by anyone other than the union—including by themselves—in employee-employer relations. And their choice not to join the union is well-known to the union that is supposed to represent them.
The Worker’s
Choice Act—introduced by Republican Reps. Dusty Johnson of South Dakota,
Greg Murphy of North Carolina, and Phil Roe of Tennessee—would change that by
ending unions’ government-granted monopoly over employee-employer negotiations,
otherwise known as exclusive representation.
Instead, workers would be free to negotiate directly with their employer or to choose a representative outside of the union.  
This would be an
important step for worker freedom and flexibility—particularly for the
increasing number of workers who do not have and do not want rigid jobs and inflexible
schedules. 
As it is today,
even if a worker in a unionized workplace doesn’t join the union, he or she
cannot negotiate an alternative work schedule or different compensation—such as
performance-based pay—than what the union negotiates. 
And if the nonunion employee has any disciplinary action taken against him or her, his or her only recourse is through the union, which is unlikely to provide the same support as it would to dues-paying union members.
In essence, those
who aren’t union members are forced to accept the terms and conditions of
employment and representation by an organization that does not actually
represent those workers’ desires and which they may strongly oppose. 
Why would workers
oppose the unions that are supposed to represent them?
For starters, unions tend to negotiate rigid pay scales, schedules, and promotion pathways. While this worked well for factories in the 1930s, it’s not ideal for a more service-oriented labor market in which workers want flexibility and greater opportunities. 
A young teacher
may significantly outperform a colleague who is 20 years his or her senior, and
yet that young teacher will likely receive half the pay, be last in line to
choose from new opportunities, and first in line to lose his or her job.
Union-dictated
pay scales also penalize high performers because unions set pay scales based on
seniority instead of employees’ performance. 

When the Giant Eagle grocery store in Edinboro, Pennsylvania,
gave two dozen of its employees’ performance-based raises, the Local 23 union
took Giant Eagle to court and forced the company to revoke those workers’ pay
raises. 
Even though those raises were above the union-negotiated pay scale and did not reduce any other workers’ wages, the union said they violated its contract because the raises resulted in some junior workers receiving higher wages than some with longer tenure. 
Most workers want
to be paid based on the work they perform, not just how long they have worked
for a company. 
Another reason
some workers oppose unions is that they often do not use members’ dues for the
benefit of workers. 
According to the Free to Teach organization, the Pennsylvania State Education Association teachers union spent 34% of its members’ dues on political activities in 2017, with those activities almost exclusively supporting Democratic politicians and liberal policies.  
Disgracefully,
members’ dues sometimes go toward corrupt and illegal activities. 
According to a compilation of federal data from Bob Gilson at FedSmith, 150
federal union officials stole more than $4.5 million from members’ dues between
2001 and 2018, with the average convicted official having stolen more than
$30,000.  
Corruption isn’t
new. The Teamsters union will soon end three decades of government oversight following its entanglement in the mob
and its use of members’ pension funds on things such as Las Vegas casino
investments. 
Nor has corruption
gone away. Recently, United Auto Workers’ union officials misused more than
$4.5 million of workers’ dues that were supposed to go toward improving
opportunities and education of employees. Instead, union officials spent those
funds on personal luxuries such as “a $350,000 Ferrari, two $36,500 pens, hundreds of
thousands of dollars in private home improvements and mortgage payments, and a
$30,000 party that featured strolling models sparking attendees’ cigars.” 
Meanwhile, the average General Motors Co. worker lost about $4,000 of wages during the recent United Auto Workers-led strike as the union pays less than minimum wage for strike pay. 
Finally, many workers don’t support unions because those unions are hostile to anyone who does not support them. Such hostility can include showing up on workers’ doorsteps, inflicting damage to their property, and making threats against workers’—and their families’—lives. 
Requiring workers
to be represented by an organization that could be openly antagonistic to them
is equivalent to stripping them of their right to be represented at all.
And on the other side, unions should not have to represent workers who do not support them by paying membership dues. Not surprisingly, unions have complained about having to represent so-called “free riders.”
It’s time to free
unions of that unfair burden and to free workers of unwanted union
representation.

"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo compared the flexible work economy to ""sweatshops."" (Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty Images)

Rachel Greszler

Rachel Greszler is research fellow in economics, budget, and entitlements in the Grover M. Hermann Center for the Federal Budget, of the Institute for Economic Freedom, at The Heritage Foundation. Read her research.
In his State of the State address on Jan. 8, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo likened 21st-century gig-economy corporations to late 18th- and early 19th-century sweatshops, the latter characterized as such for their poor working conditions, exploitation of workers, and violations of labor laws. 
By asserting that entirely optional gig and contract-based work “is exploitive, abusive, it’s a scam, it’s a fraud,” Cuomo displayed a thorough lack of understanding of the gig economy and independent workers. 
For starters, there are no corporate factories in the gig economy, and aside from some more strenuous “task rabbit”-type jobs, very few gig workers break a sweat. 
“Exploitive”? Independent work is entirely at will. Individuals choose what jobs they want to perform, what hours they want to work, and they have wide latitude in how to accomplish their jobs.
>>> California’s ‘Pro-Worker’ Law Is Killing Jobs Left and Right
“Abusive”? Sweatshops imposed harsh conditions on workers, even locking them in unsafe buildings and preventing them from leaving. The essence of independent work is that there is no factory or corporate job site. Independent workers use their own property, or they contract with a client to determine their job site. 
A “scam”? Sweatshops often withheld workers’ wages, and some were even implicated in human trafficking scams. Most independent workers get paid more quickly than formal employees, who typically collect biweekly or semimonthly paychecks. 
Contractors typically get paid within a week of when their
work is completed. Most temporary-help agencies pay weekly. Uber drivers get
paid every week, and Etsy sellers receive payment within one to three days of a
sale. Gig platforms typically provide payment records that can be easily
accessed from participants’ smartphones.
A “fraud”? There’s nothing fake, nor phony, about an estimated one out of every three workers in the U.S. participating in independent work, about the additional income and opportunities gig and contract work generates, about the value workers place on the flexibility and autonomy it provides, or about the convenience and value it delivers to individuals and families across the U.S. who purchase goods and services that would otherwise be inaccessible. 
It doesn’t appear that any of Cuomo’s disparaging adjectives apply to independent work in the modern economy. Nor does his likening it to sweatshops hold true.
According to the Department of Labor, the definition of a sweatshop is a factory that violates two or more U.S. labor laws. 
>>> California’s Latest Act of Idiocy: Killing Freelance Work
The gig economy and contract-based employment at-large aren’t violating any labor laws. It’s just that Cuomo, along with unions and the lawmakers they support, wants to make them illegal.
In his address, Cuomo said of contract and gig-based employment that “it must stop, and it has to stop here and now.” 
Such calls to end gig and contract-based work are
founded in the paternalistic presumption that workers are better off
working for a boss than for themselves, and that politicians’ prescribed
“protections” are more beneficial than the autonomy
and flexibility independent workers value.
Independent workers disagree. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, “Fewer than 1 in 10 independent contractors would prefer a traditional work arrangement.” And the average Uber driver wouldn’t work at all if they had to commit to a traditional taxicab employment arrangement.
There are many reasons for those preferences, as independent
workers represent a diverse group of individuals such as: 
Wiping out opportunities for all these workers in a
misguided effort to provide “protections” to a minority of independent workers
who lament not having formal employment arrangements is not the solution. 
If some customers who shop at Food Lion complain that it doesn’t provide all the organic products they want, the solution is for them to shop at Whole Foods instead. It’s not for the federal government to require that Food Lion replace its non-organic products with organic versions.
Fortunately, in today’s strong labor market, with record low
unemployment and more job openings than there are people looking for jobs,
individuals who are not content with gig-economy or contract-based jobs have
lots of opportunities for formal employment.
Government interventions that try to provide workers with
more “protections”—such as those of Obamacare and other employer mandates that
kick in as companies employ more workers and provide them more hours—end up
costing as much or more in lost jobs and incomes as they add in new
“protections.”   
A better alternative than mandates is for independent workers
to join organizations, such as the Freelancers Union, that
pool workers to offer lower-cost health and disability insurance that formal
employment provides.
A New York politician once argued in favor of Uber: “[I]t’s offering a great service for people, and it’s giving people jobs. I don’t think government should be in the business of trying to restrict job growth.”
That politician pointed out that “if you try to say we are going to cap your job growth here, they’ll go next door and grow their jobs.” 
Ironically, those statements came from Cuomo back in 2015, when he was criticizing New York Mayor Bill de Blasio for imposing limits on Uber.
Cuomo was right when he
characterized Uber as “one of these great
inventions, startups, of this new economy,” but he is absurdly wrong when he
refers to it and other gig-economy and contract jobs now as “sweatshops.”

"Although the national debt presents risks, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell says the economy now flourishes. Pictured: Powell testifies during a hearing before the House Budget Committee Nov. 14, 2019, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. (Photo: Alex Wong/Getty Images)
The labor market is incredibly strong and the economic
outlook favorable, yet risks remain. That was Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome
Powell’s message
to Congress on Nov. 13.
Powell highlighted many positive features of the
economic outlook, including:
Important risks remain, though:
Powell’s
caution about unsustainable and rising debt is noteworthy. Already, the $23
trillion national debt amounts to $178,300
per household in the U.S. Add on Social Security’s $13.9 trillion in unfunded obligations over the next 75 years
and Medicare’s $42.3 trillion, and total debt plus unfunded obligations rises to
$614,000 per household. With a median household income of just over $63,000,
that’s clearly unsustainable. 
And it’s not just the already-high debt,
it’s the risk that such high debt will cause a spike in interest rates, requiring
drastic spending cuts at the same time as massive tax increases. According to
the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, just a 1% increase in interest
rates would raise interest costs by $1.9 trillion over the next 10 years. On a per-household basis,
that’s an extra $147,300 over 10 years.
But 1% interest rate
increases are mild compared to recent historical fiscal crises. In Greece,
interest rates rose by about 8% from 2010 to 2011, and briefly
surpassed 35% in 2012. In Puerto Rico, rates spiked as much as 2.5% in a single month. When governments can’t
borrow at reasonable rates, they face extremely limited choices. 
If U.S. policymakers
continue to spend without restraint and put off confronting out-of-control
entitlement program growth, modest reforms no longer will be possible.
Austerity will be the only option. 
Take Greece, for example.
Its forced austerity measures of spending cuts and tax increases amounted to 40%
of gross domestic product and caused the economy to shrink by 25% and the
unemployment rate to rise to 27%. That austerity “saddled Greece with suffocatingly high taxes, deterring
business activity and contributing to heavy emigration, especially of young and
educated people,” according to a
recent Wall Street Journal article.
That’s why the U.S.’ unsustainable debt is arguably one of America’s greatest threats. 
Failure to address this now
could mean that today’s generation of children could be the first to reverse
America’s trend of upward economic movement and instead end up worse-off than
their parents.
But that doesn’t have to be
the case. 
Solving our fiscal crisis is not easy, but it is possible and The Heritage Foundation has a plan that would balance the budget within 10 years, let workers keep more of their hard-earned dollars, and give individuals more control over their future. 
As Powell pointed out, putting the U.S. budget on a “sustainable path” would boost the growth and “vigor” of the U.S. economy and give policymakers the tools to provide stability in future downturns.

In a competitive global economy, employers must be able to
adapt to meet market demands. If they don’t, they’ll lose out to other
businesses that do adapt, and offer better products and lower prices as a
result. 
Similarly, city and state governments that can’t or don’t adapt
will lose residents and the economic output and tax revenues they take with
them.
Unfortunately, high pension costs have hamstrung the ability
to adapt for many companies and state and local governments.
Instead of helping employers adapt so that their workers can
keep their jobs, unions across the U.S. are blocking it, choosing instead to
try to micromanage employers out of existence or into bankruptcy.
Defined benefit pensions are largely a relic of the past for private sector, nonunionized workers. But where unions exist, onerous pension costs are dragging down companies and state and local economies. 
Take General Motors Co., for example. The United Auto Workers union recently led GM workers to a nearly six-week strike, costing the average GM factory worker about $4,000 in lost wages and resulting in nearly $4 billion in lost earnings for GM. 
The reason for the strike? A push for higher compensation,
including shifting temporary workers to high-cost, full-employee positions, and
an attempt to bring jobs back from Mexico to the U.S. Of course, higher
compensation costs make it harder for GM to produce cars here, and ultimately,
the union couldn’t stand up to the forces of globalization. 
Although GM factory workers earn between
$17 and $30 per hour, the automaker’s total compensation costs of $63
per hour for those workers are more than double their pay. In large part,
that’s due to extremely high pension costs. 
Instead of pushing for even higher compensation costs, the
UAW should help reduce pension costs so that more workers can keep their jobs. While
pension benefits are important to employees, most would be willing to accept a
slightly less generous pension if it prevented tens of thousands of fellow
employees from losing their jobs.  
Extravagant Teacher Pensions
Another pension-plagued strike is the one that just ended in
Chicago, where teachers went on strike for 11 days. In addition to lost
education, families lost income and work days as they grappled with either
staying home or finding child care. 
Although wages were the big sticking point in the negotiations—the union wanted the 16% pay increase that the city proposed to occur over five years to instead accrue over three years—pension costs limit possible pay raises.
That’s because in addition to being among the highest-paid
teachers in the nation, with a median salary of $75,000
that would rise to nearly $100,000 over five years under the mayor’s
proposal, Chicago teachers enjoy extremely generous pension benefits. A teacher
with a 30-year career receives a $76,500
pension for life.
But because past politicians and unions who promised
generous pension benefits failed to negotiate and put aside the funds to pay
those benefits, Chicago is not only making pension contributions for current
teachers but also paying the unfunded costs of retired teachers’ pensions. 
Because of its sorry state, Chicago’s public school system
has a junk
bond rating, below even that of Detroit.
And the city’s debt already is driving out residents and businesses. 
Chicago is the only city among the top 10 metropolitan areas
in the U.S. to have lost
population in each of the past four years. And enrollment in public schools
is down almost 12% over the past decade.   
Perhaps that’s because high pension costs are chipping away
at other government services and requiring significant tax increases. 
Already, Chicago residents have
experienced a $1.1 billion property tax hike, a 29.5% tax on water and sewage
bills, and a 100% increase in a telephone tax, among others, to pay for the
city’s generous pension promises. If the teachers union had gotten its
way, property taxes would have increased by more than $220
per year.
There’s no fair way to erase these pension costs, but there
are ways to minimize the consequences. For starters, the Chicago teachers union
should allow modest reforms to its pension system. 
According to an economic analysis, Illinois teachers valued additional pension benefits at only 20 cents on the dollar, yet the city of Chicago is contributing 27% of teachers’ salaries—about $20,000 per teacher—to the pension system. That means that pension reforms could save taxpayers money and provide teachers with the pay increases they want. 
A Bankrupt Coal
Company
Finally, we have the just-declared
bankruptcy of the largest coal company in the U.S., Murray Energy Corp. 
Coal bankruptcies are nothing new, and Obama-era regulations
further exacerbated the industry’s decline. But most people don’t realize the
toll that unfunded pension costs have taken on the coal industry. 
Murray Energy was by far the largest remaining coal company
contributing to the pension fund of the United Mine Workers of America. Although
most coal production in the U.S. no longer is unionized, Murray Energy had a
significant number of UMWA employees for whom it was paying extremely high
pension costs.
According to a 2016
hearing in the U.S. Senate, pension costs were about $2 per hour for every
employee in the plan in 2007, compared to about $6 in 2016.
Data from the union’s most recent financial filing, for
2017, suggests that Murray Energy may have been paying tens of thousands of
dollars per year in pension contributions on behalf of each of its roughly
2,000 employees. 
Employer contributions totaled $112 million, and if Murray
Energy accounted for roughly 60% of the plan’s 3,500 participants, it would
have paid $67 million, or $33,000 per worker. 
And the sad reality is that current UMWA workers will
receive little—if any—of those five-figure pension contributions because the union’s
plan will be insolvent within three years.
It’s hard to compete with nonunionized coal companies that likely
pay a couple of thousand dollars per year into their workers’ 401(k)s. 
The Solution
So if high pension costs are dragging down companies and
governments, but those pension costs are compensation that employees earned, what’s
the solution? 
Long term, the solution is to transition to defined
contribution 401(k) retirement accounts. If employers and governments
contribute directly into workers accounts, they can’t short-change their employees
and the contributions cannot be used to finance other government spending. 
And if workers own their retirement benefits, they know how
much money they have and no one can take that money away from them. 
In the short term, grappling with $638 billion worth of
unfunded private union pension promises and between $4 trillion and $6 trillion
in unfunded state and local pensions will be no easy task. But there are reasonable
solutions. 
Employers and lawmakers need to be held accountable to properly fund the promises they make, and employers should be allowed to reform their benefit structures to minimize losses for employees and retirees.

As a woman who gave birth to six children and is
raising them, I find being compared to a breeding dog incredibly offensive. 
Earlier this week at a hearing held by the House Oversight and Reform Committee, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said the government should require at least eight weeks of paid maternity leave because puppies get eight weeks with their dog mothers.
Our research fellow Rachel Greszler—a mother of six—shared solutions to increase access to #paidfamilyleave.@AOC responded by ignoring her research and comparing new mothers to breeding dogs. pic.twitter.com/MgX6BvpxRJ
I hope that before Ocasio-Cortez uses this comparison
again, she will consider how insulting it is. 
It’s also a terrible comparison, considering that puppies are taken from their mothers and sold after eight weeks (most states require an eight-week period for vaccination purposes). These puppies also never get to meet their fathers.
But let’s consider the more serious matter of how we
can help families who don’t have access to paid family leave. 
In the hearing, Ocasio-Cortez presented misleading
data, failed to recognize basic economic principles, and ignored the evidence
of government-provided paid family leave programs across the world.
Ocasio-Cortez and others claimed that 80% of workers don’t
have access to paid family leave. That’s at best a half-truth. The 80% figure only
includes workers who do not have access to formal paid family and medical leave policies
that cover parental leave, personal medical leave, and family care leave. 
>>> Problematic Women: Why Government-Funded Maternity Leave Is Not the Answer
Most
workers who take paid family leave do not use a formal paid
family leave policy, but rather a combination of vacation, sick leave, and
other paid time off. In addition, 47%
of full-time private-sector workers have access to employer-provided short-term
disability insurance policies covering maternity leave and their own medical
leave. 
Also, many workers have access to state-based paid
family leave programs. The eight states and the District of Columbia that have
enacted state-based paid family leave programs account for 29% of all U.S. workers.

Then, there are the basic economics of paid family
leave. 
The
Market Is Providing What Workers Want
Workers want paid family leave. Employers want to be able to provide it because it helps them attract employees and keep them on board. 
A strong economy and tight labor market are doing more for workers than any government paid family leave program ever could. With more job openings than there are workers available to fill them, employers have to compete to attract and retain the workers they need by offering higher wages and more benefits.
And when employers can keep more of the money they
earn and don’t have to waste resources on costly and unhelpful regulations,
they can devote more resources to the pay and benefits workers want.
Finally, when workers have higher wage growth and can
keep more of the money they earn, they are better able to afford taking leave
from work.
That’s why the combination of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and fewer unnecessary regulations have been so helpful in improving workers’ ability to take paid leave. The tax cuts put $1,400 per year back into the typical American household’s pocketbook, spurred companies to provide more paid family leave, produced wage gains of about $1,500 last year for workers making less than $25,000, and lowered the unemployment rate to a 50-year record low.
But despite all the benefits of paid family leave, we
cannot ignore that it has costs and consequences. A government-run paid family
leave program cannot erase those costs—it can only redistribute them.
The
AOC-Backed Bill
The FAMILY Act, which members like Ocasio-Cortez are proposing, purports that it would only cost workers a cup of coffee a week, but it would end up costing a tank of gas instead. 
As structured, the bill could provide 12 weeks of paid
leave to only a fraction of workers who want to take it. 
It’s simple math: If you collect $200 in taxes from
the typical worker and provide an average benefit of $7,600 over 12 weeks, then
fewer than 3% of workers can take leave in a given year. 
But about 16% of workers take leave. That leaves a big
gap between who wants to take leave and who would be able to take it.
Unless the government implements a rationed paid
family leave policy, it will have to collect drastically more in taxes than it
claims—closer to $1,500
for the average worker. 
Those costs would hurt low-income workers the most.
And this is the third point Ocasio-Cortez failed to
recognize. 
Redistributing
From the Poor to the Rich
Across the world, government-run paid family leave policies are regressive, taxing everyone and redistributing that money away from low-income earners to middle- and upper-income ones. 
How can we increase access to #paidfamilyleave? Rachel Greszler offered insights and solutions—and explained why a federal program would be worse than the programs many workers have today. pic.twitter.com/KzgPL5vnux
There are a number of reasons for that, including low
awareness among lower-income earners, and the fact that partial government
benefits just aren’t enough—someone making $600 a week ($15/hour) can’t get by
on a $396 government-provided paid family leave check.
Consider the evidence:
And attempts to reverse these failures have failed. San
Francisco enacted 100% benefits for many workers, and still,
low-income mothers were only half as likely to receive government-provided
benefits as high-income mothers.  
Moreover, a recent economic analysis of California’s
program found that it reduced
women’s employment and earnings, as well as their
fertility rates. And European-sized policies have hurt women’s career
prospects and their wages.
Well-intended policies like these too often produce
negative results. 
Let
Employers and Workers Stay Flexible
Most American families are best served by flexible,
targeted approaches that meet their individual needs through voluntary
employer-provided benefits, personal savings, and family supports. 
Policymakers should work to increase access to paid
family leave through policies that help employers have the resources to provide
these benefits, and that give workers more
income and flexibility to choose what is best for them. 
The last thing our country needs is another unaffordable
and poorly targeted national entitlement program that fails to meet the real
needs of workers.

Americans lose when Congress is in the business of
picking winners and losers.
Just this week, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell
signed onto a bill, the Bipartisan American Miners Act of 2019, that would bail
out one multiemployer, or union pension plan. 
This Senate bill is similar to the combination of two bills in the House—H.R. 934 and H.R. 935, the Health Benefits for Miners Act of 2019 and the Miners Pension Protection Act—that the Energy and Natural Resources Committee recently passed.
There is a lot of misleading and false reporting about
what these bills would do. 
Here are six things you need to know:
Congress can help coal miners as well as 10 million other workers who are at risk of losing most of their promised pension benefits by: preserving the solvency of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., fixing the rules so that broken promises do not happen again, and providing tools for plans to minimize pension losses across beneficiaries.

If you want less of something, raise its price. That’s
the logic behind policies such as cigarette and soda taxes and plastic bag fees.
Somehow, policymakers in California thought that by
raising the cost of doing business with independent workers, they could make
all those workers better off.
But now, instead of higher benefits and improved job
protections, many independent workers are losing
their jobs, along with the flexibility and autonomy they value.
In September, the California legislature passed, and Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law, AB 5—a bill that upends the gig economy and contract-based employment in California. 
With a little more than 10% of workers engaged in independent work as their primary job and as many as 1 in 3 workers participating in independent work on some level, California’s law could affect anywhere from 1 million to 5 million workers (not including its inconsistent exemptions).   
By applying a three-part “ABC” test that forces companies to treat many individuals they simply do business or contract with as formal employees, the California law is causing havoc for many companies and, particularly, for independent workers—at least those that didn’t receive a special exemption under the law.
>>> California’s Disastrous State Illustrates Limits of Progressivism
Small employers will be hardest hit because they rely
more heavily on contractors. Businesses that have four or fewer employees use
6.7 contractors, on average. 
Imagine a small landscape company that has three
employees and contracts with a half-dozen others for services such as tree
removal, stonework, or sprinkler installation. 
Under the new law, those contract workers would have to become formal employees, meaning the owner would be in charge of the work they perform (even though he is not an expert in their services) and how many hours they work and would have to provide them with employee benefits. 
Since that’s probably not feasible or advantageous, the
owner would instead have to cut ties with those contractors and stop offering
their services. That will make it harder for him to compete with bigger
companies who can fully and formally employ more specialized workers.
Even if big companies, such as Uber, might be able to
remain profitable by treating workers as employees, drivers and customers will
pay a price. 
Uber is challenging the law in court, but if it and other gig platforms can’t negotiate or litigate their way out of AB 5, they presumably will have to take away the autonomy and flexibility that draw workers to the gig economy. 
For ride-share companies, drivers likely would be assigned prescribed shifts and locations, they could be required to pick up certain passengers, they would need to request time off in advance, and they might be forced to work exclusively for one company.
These companies could also decide that the increased liability of formal employment means they need to monitor workers by video to ensure control over their employees’ workplaces and performance. 
And gig economy customers can count on steep price hikes, which will reduce demand and lead to even fewer jobs and services.
Independent truck drivers also are hit hard by the law. According to the California Trucking Association, which filed a lawsuit against the state in November, AB 5 will put 70,000 owner-operator truckers out of work. 
Independent
truckers such as Brian Gray already have packed up their
families and moved out of California, and may others, such as Jeff and Elyse
Fink, are narrowing their relocation options. 
“As of Jan. 1, I was told the
company can’t dispatch me with loads leaving California if we still want to
work for the company,” Jeff
Fink said. 
These drivers don’t want to leave the state, but
they’ve invested in their trucks, and those investments won’t pay off under the
law as written. Fortunately, this group was granted at least a temporary
reprieve on Dec. 31, when a federal judge issued a temporary
restraining order against the law’s application to
independent truckers. 
A hearing considering a permanent injunction for
truckers is set for Jan. 13.
Freelance writers and photographers also are suing California over AB 5; the Pacific Legal Foundation is representing them in their argument that the law unconstitutionally restricts free speech and media. 
The groups also argue that the law’s unequal application deprives certain groups of equal representation. For example, juice drivers, journalists, and photographers are subject to AB 5, but milk drivers, grant writers, and fine artists are exempt. 
They also argue that AB 5 strips freelancers of their ownership rights, because formal employment usually requires these professionals to give ownership of their work over to their employer.
The law should be applied equally. Laws that
necessitate frequent exemptions and lead to numerous lawsuits are undemocratic
and destructive.
If California lawmakers want to help independent workers, they should restore the flexibility and opportunity workers sought when they entered the gig economy. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, fewer than 1 in 10 independent contractors would prefer a traditional work arrangement. These workers want this arrangement. They don’t want to be “protected” from it. 
Many of these independent workers are single parents, individuals with disabilities, and women, who tend to want and need more flexibility and autonomy than traditional employment provides.
Yet, California policymakers seem intent on having
everyone answer to a boss—one who will determine their schedule, monitor the
work they perform, and control how much income they can earn.

Director Martin Scorsese’s award-winning new film “The Irishman” contains some important history for lawmakers as they prepare to vote on a spending package that would provide a $6 billion taxpayer bailout to one select union.
That union is the United Mine Workers of America. 
For the first
time in history, Congress is poised to use taxpayer dollars to fund the broken
pension promises of a private-sector union and private employers.
We can bet this
won’t be a one-and-done move, however. 
The next big pension plan in line for a bailout is a Teamsters’ union plan—the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Pension Fund.  
Organized crime within the Teamsters union was the plot of “The Irishman.” Central to the story of the 3-1/2-hour feature film was the virtually unchecked control over the Teamsters’ pension fund by then-Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa, using it for mafia-related loans and personal gain. 
In fact, it was fraud and conspiracy related to the union’s pension fund that landed Hoffa in prison, and after that, the Teamsters’ pension fund was under federal oversight for decades.
Of course, not all—and, hopefully, only a small fraction of—union-run pension plans have been plagued by illegal activities. 
Yet, nearly all have suffered from serious mismanagement, made possible by special treatment given to union-run pension plans that were given wide latitude in lieu of more stringent funding rules required of nonunion plans.
As a result, virtually the entire multiemployer pension system is on the path toward insolvency. 
Across the U.S.,
close to 1,400 multiemployer pension plans have collectively set aside only 43
cents on the dollar to pay promised pensions. In total, the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation estimates that multiemployer plans have $638
billion in unfunded pension promises.  
The United Mine Workers covers fewer than 1% of multiemployer pension recipients, and its roughly $6 billion in underfunding is only the tip of the iceberg. 
The Central States Teamsters pension plan has about $44 billion in unfunded pension promises, with the roughly five dozen other Teamsters-associated pensions plans adding even more.
While these two plans have drawn significant attention and consideration for taxpayer bailouts, they represent only a small fraction of all multiemployer pension plans, workers, and retirees. 
It’s wrong that employers and unions were allowed to make promises without properly funding them, and it’s unfair that nearly 100,000 coal miners, 1.4 million Teamsters members, and more than 9 million other workers and retirees with private union pensions across the U.S. stand to lose a significant portion of their pension benefits through no fault of their own. 
But taxpayers had no role in these broken pension promises, and despite the United Mine Workers’ claim, the federal government did not make a promise to coal miners. 
The solution to the multiemployer pension crisis is not to bail out just one of more than 1,300 massively underfunded union pension plans without doing anything to improve the system. 
That would either create huge inequities—with mine workers receiving 100% of promised benefits, while others receive mere pennies on the dollar—or else it would set the stage for a massive taxpayer bailout of numerous other private and public pensions.
If Congress
opens the door to pension bailouts—including $638
billion in private union pensions and up to $6 trillion in state and local pensions—the price tag could reach $52,000 for every household in the U.S. 
Congress
needs to change the rules so that this never happens again, to maintain the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation solvency as a pension safety net, and to require
plans to act sooner, rather than later, to minimize pension losses.
Instead
of tying a selective bailout for just one union pension plan onto an
end-of-the-year spending bill, Congress should provide a comprehensive solution
to the multiemployer pension crisis—one that doesn’t just shift the bill to
taxpayers and one that doesn’t leave 99 out of 100 pensioners in the
lurch.

"A newly proposed pensions bailout bill would cost taxpayers $100 billion—the equivalent of a new $600 tax on every worker in the U.S. (Photo: Prakasit Khuansuwan/EyeEm/Getty Images)

A friend of mine recently had the unfortunate experience of dealing with multiple abscessed teeth in her children. 
These abscesses occurred because a neglectful dentist had “treated” her kids’ cavities by concealing them with quick, painless fixes instead of drilling down and eliminating the root of the problem. 
In the end, the kids had to undergo much more intense, expensive, and painful treatments than if their cavities had been properly treated to begin with.
The Congressional Budget Office has recently found that Congress’ so-called “solution” to a $638 billion multiemployer pension crisis would similarly exacerbate the situation—but without the benefit of Novocain.
On July 24, the
House of Representatives passed H.R. 397, the Rehabilitation for Multiemployer
Pensions Act. (The same day, a group of senators reintroduced a similar bill,
the Butch Lewis Act, named after a
well-known union and pension activist.) 
The bill, or a similar pension bailout, could be tied to must-pass legislation this fall or early in 2020. 
The bill by itself would cost taxpayers more than $100 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The first component would contain about $35 billion in loan costs. 
Under the bill, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that a new pension rehabilitation administration would provide $39.7 billion in loans, of which taxpayers would recoup only $7.4 billion in interest and loan repayments. That’s equivalent to a roughly 80% default rate.
In addition, already
insolvent plans would receive $3.6 billion in loans that they likely could not
repay. 
The second component of the bill would consist of an estimated $71 billion in direct cash assistance, primarily through annual disbursements. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the Central States Pension Fund would receive $3 billion in direct cash in 2020 alone. 
Although the bill includes some offsetting revenues, or “pay fors,” all but about $6 billion of that revenue is unrelated to the bill’s purpose, and some of those revenues have already been claimed by bills the House previously passed.
The bill’s total cost of $100 billion—the equivalent of a new $600 tax on every worker in the U.S.—is a huge sum of money, particularly for a Band-Aid solution. 
In a Sept. 6 letter from the Congressional Budget Office to the Senate Budget Committee, the agency noted that even if more than $100 billion in taxpayer funds were given to a select group of pension plans, only a small portion of those plans could repay their loans, and most plans receiving assistance would still become insolvent. 
The letter states:
About one-quarter of the affected pension plans would become insolvent in the 30-year loan period and would not fully repay their loans. … Most of the other plans would become insolvent in the decade following their repayment of their loans.
But even that
costly and ineffective assessment only scratches the surface of the pervasive
multiemployer pension crisis. That’s because only 139 pension plans would be
eligible for taxpayer assistance.
According to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, there are 1,374 multiemployer, or union, pension plans across the U.S., meaning only about 10% of them would qualify for assistance under this bill. 
Yet, a whopping 96% of multiemployer pension plans are less than 60% funded, and collectively, they are on track to be able to pay out only 42 cents of every dollar in promised benefits. 
While the proposed
pension bailout reduces apparent costs by limiting assistance to only a small
portion of the most deeply troubled plans—those considered critical and
declining in 2019—it leaves hundreds of other multiemployer plans that will
become insolvent at later dates looming for subsequent bailouts by future Congresses.

If policymakers
are going to provide a taxpayer bailout, the least they could do is fix the
problems that led to employers and unions promising $638 billion more than they
set aside to pay workers. 
But instead of improving the solvency of plans and preventing future underfunding, the bill would incentivize plans to become even more underfunded so that they could push their broken promises onto taxpayers. 
The Congressional Budget Office notes the incentives of the bill, such as plans changing their discount-rate assumptions in order to qualify for taxpayer assistance. 
And it’s unlikely that future Congresses would withhold assistance from plans that become insolvent after the bill’s enactment, because excluded plans would argue that’s “unfair.”
Thus, the roughly
1,200 plans that wouldn’t initially qualify for assistance would nevertheless anticipate
a future bailout and continue to promise benefits without setting aside the
funds to pay them. 
Treating all
multiemployer pension plans equally could lead to a taxpayer bailout in excess
of $638 billion for private-sector pensions and an
additional $4 trillion to $6 trillion for state and local pensions.
At a cost of $30,000
to $42,000 per worker, that’s more than many Gen-Xers and millennials have set
aside for their own retirement.  
In short, this is
a terrible deal for taxpayers, and it’s no good for pensioners—particularly
younger ones—who will still end up with insolvent pension plans. 
But it’s great
for unions and employers who wouldn’t have to pay for their broken pension
promises and could instead walk away with a lobbying victory to report to their
dues-paying union members. 
A bailout without reform is no solution and would only make problems worse. 
Instead, Congress should enact these 12 reforms to protect workers and retirees without forcing taxpayers to pay for private union pensions’ broken promises—and without setting a precedent for federal bailouts of nonunion private pensions and state and local pensions.

"November saw very little change in the U.S. labor market, according to a new employment report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Employers added a net 178,000 new jobs while the unemployment rate dropped. However, unemployment fell in large measure due to a continued drop in labor force participation. The economy largely continued on its current trajectory.
The November household survey reported mixed results. Headline numbers show the unemployment rate fell by 0.3 percentage points down to 4.6 percent—a large and statistically significant drop. However, the employment-to-population ratio (that is, the proportion of the adult population with jobs) remained unchanged.
Unemployment fell primarily because labor force participation continued to decline, dropping to 62.7 percent. Americans who aren’t looking for work do not count as unemployed. So when Americans leave the labor force, this mechanically decreases the unemployment rate—even if hiring does not improve.
Demographic changes, such as the aging and retirement of the baby boomers, can only explain one part of the ongoing exodus from the labor force.
Among younger “prime age” workers (25-54 years old) labor force participation fell more than it did across the entire adult population. It appears that the labor market is weaker than the headline unemployment rate suggests.
Interestingly, the largest drop in labor force participation in November occurred among the college-educated. Their labor force participation rate dropped 0.4 percentage points.
Labor force participation rates did not change at all for workers with a high school education or some college. This could reflect a real change in the labor prospects of more educated Americans, though it could also just be statistical noise.
The household survey presented other modestly good news. The long-term unemployment rate dropped, and the average duration of unemployment fell by almost a week. This could be a positive sign.
Unfortunately, the Bureau of Labor Statistics report does not identify whether those who have been long-term unemployed found jobs or stopped looking for work altogether. So falling long-term unemployment may simply represent the long-term unemployed giving up on finding work.
The payroll survey showed modest gains across several industries. The professional and business services (+63,000), health care and social assistance (+35,000), leisure and hospitality (+29,000), and government (+22,000) sectors accounted for the vast majority of November’s net employment growth.
The payroll survey also showed average hourly earnings falling by 3 cents last month. That change probably represents statistical noise, not an actual drop in wages.
Measured hourly wages rose considerably between August and October. Part of that increase was probably statistical fluctuations that did not occur in the November report. Over the past year, average hourly earnings have grown 2.5 percent—well above the roughly 1 percent rise in inflation over that period.
The labor market continues to grow at a modest pace. The economy appears to be neither shifting into high gear nor falling into a recession. For the many workers hurt by the Great Recession, there could be worse news. But the recovery they’ve long been waiting for still has yet to come.

"On Wednesday, President Barack Obama took an economic victory lap in Elkhart, Indiana. The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ employment report, which came out Friday, shows he was far too optimistic.
Both the household and payroll surveys showed employment growth slowing to a crawl in May, while hundreds of thousands of Americans stopped looking for work. Seven years after the recession officially ended, the economy is not out of the woods.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics has two principal employment surveys: the household survey (which interviews workers) and the payroll survey (which interviews businesses). Both showed tepid job growth in May.
The payroll survey reported employers created just 38,000 net new jobs last month. Almost all this growth occurred in the health care sector (+46,000) and government (+13,000). Most other sectors showed slight gains or experienced job losses. Worryingly, temporary help service employment contracted by 21,000 jobs.
Temporary jobs are often a leading indicator of future hiring patterns: employers typically cut back on temporary employees before letting regular staff go. Additional payroll survey data also showed employers created 59,000 fewer jobs than previously estimated in March and April.
The household survey showed even slower job growth (+26,000), although the difference between the two surveys was not statistically significant. If this hiring rate continues, job creation will not keep pace with population growth and unemployment will rise.
Nonetheless, the household survey reported the unemployment rate fell significantly, from 5 percent to 4.7 percent.
This was not good news; it happened because the number of Americans outside the labor force jumped by 664,000 in May. The government does not count people not looking for work as unemployed. Their exit caused the labor force participation rate to drop 0.2 percentage points, and pushed down the unemployment rate.
But the overall employment-to-population ratio—the proportion of the population with jobs—did not improve at all. The May drop in labor force participation, coming on top of the decrease in April, entirely erased the gains in labor force participation that occurred in the first quarter of 2016.
Economists had expected some of this decline. Demographers long forecast labor force participation would fall as the baby boomers began to retire. But labor force participation fell for younger workers too. The labor force participation rate for so-called prime age workers (25 to 54 years old) also dropped by 0.2 percentage points.
Interestingly, the entire drop in participation for workers 25 and older occurred among Americans without a high school degree. Labor force participation rose slightly for workers with at least a high school education, or more.
More discouraging news came from part-time employment. The number of Americans employed part-time for economic reasons jumped by almost 500,000. In May, many more workers who wanted full-time hours could not find them.
The only bright spot in the report came in wage growth. Average hourly earnings increased 5 cents in May and have risen 2.5 percent over the past year. Since inflation has grown just 1.1 percent over that period, real wages have grown roughly 1.4 percent in the past 12 months. That represents solid growth by historical standards. But it may not last if the labor market weakens.
Obama has overseen the weakest recovery of the post-war era, and this jobs report illustrates just how fragile this recovery has been.

"Juggling work and family life is hard. On Wednesday the Labor Department made it even harder for millions of salaried workers. The administration’s new overtime regulations will effectively turn them into hourly employees.
The regulation won’t increase their earnings, but it will greatly reduce their control over their schedules. The Fair Labor Standards Act requires employers to pay hourly workers overtime for working over 40 hours a week.
But the Fair Labor Standards Act regulations exempt many salaried employees. This makes sense: Salaried employees get paid to do a particular job, not work particular hours. They also generally have more control over when and where they work.
Many salaried employees have the flexibility to do things like take off early in the afternoon to attend a child’s soccer game, and then finish their work from home in the evening when their child has gone to sleep. Similarly, millions of salaried employees telecommute at least once a month.
The Labor Department just restricted this flexibility.
On Wednesday it raised the overtime “threshold” test for salaried employees to $47,500 a year. All salaried employees making less than that—no matter how advanced their job duties—now qualify for overtime. Their employers must pay time and a half when they work more than 40 hours a week.
On the surface this seems appealing. Why shouldn’t workers get extra pay for working longer hours? However, economic research shows that is unlikely to happen. Most employers respond to overtime laws by reducing base pay an offsetting amount. Combining new overtime pay and lower salaries, most workers will earn almost exactly what they made before.
This is what happened when IBM reclassified 7,000 salaried and technical-support workers as overtime-eligible in a lawsuit settlement. It also cut their base pay by 15 percent, leaving total earnings unaffected. Even liberal supporters of the rule concede that the “wage offer reflects expected overtime hours” and so there will be “no change at the margin” in pay.
The rule will change how employees work. Overtime-eligible salaried employees must carefully log their hours. Each time they respond to a work e-mail, take a work phone call, or do any other work from home, their employer must track and pay them for it. If they do not, they risk getting sued. Trial lawyers filed 8,800 Fair Labor Standards Act lawsuits in 2015, many of them for employers who did not compensate overtime-eligible employees for work done remotely.
In order to avoid lawsuits, many employers deny flexible work arrangements to overtime-eligible employees. Virtually all employers who permit remote work and flexible work arrangements allow overtime-exempt employees to use them.
Only about half allow workers covered by overtime regulations to do so. As the head of human resources for Pitney Bowes explained to reporters, the company turned down requests from overtime-eligible staff to work from home because: “You just don’t take the [legal] risk.”
The Labor Department says this regulation will help workers. It is much more likely to make balancing work and family even more difficult.

"The labor market didn’t change much in October, according to today’s Bureau of Labor Statistics employment report.
Unemployment and job creation have remained steady over 2016. Those trends continued last month.
The household survey reported that unemployment fell by 0.1 percentage points, to 5.0 percent. However, this drop primarily occurred because over 400,000 Americans left the labor force. (Americans who aren’t looking for work do not count as unemployed.)
Consequently, labor force participation also dropped 0.1 percentage points, to 62.8 percent.
This small movement is almost certainly statistical noise. In September, unemployment and labor force participation rose slightly. The October numbers reversed those shifts, bringing both the unemployment rate and labor force participation rate back to their August level.
The labor market has not changed much over the past several months.
The payroll survey tells a similar story. It found that employers created 161,000 net new jobs in October—close to the average rate of job growth over 2016.
The payroll survey found all net job creation occurred in the service sector, primarily professional and business services (plus 43,000), health care (plus 31,000), and government (plus 19,000). In October, the goods producing sector added no net jobs.
The hourly earnings figures of the payroll survey were the best news in the jobs report. Average earnings rose 10 cents in October, to $25.92 an hour. Over the past year, average hourly earnings have risen 2.8 percent—considerably faster than inflation (approximately 1 percent). Workers’ earnings have improved measurably over the past year.
Nonetheless, some of the wounds from the recession have yet to heal. The average unemployed American has been without work for over six months (27.2 weeks).
That figure has scarcely changed over the past year. While more Americans have jobs, many without them still find getting work very difficult.
The October jobs report shows no sign of another recession. But it also shows little sign of an accelerating recovery, either.

"The Aviation Innovation Reform and Reauthorization Act contains several reforms that move in the right direction. Notably, it removes America’s air traffic control system from the Federal Aviation Administration and establishes it as a federally chartered, nonprofit corporation.
But the legislation includes troubling labor provisions. Its supporters seem intent on buying government union support by giving them even more leverage over the public than they now possess.
This sets a terrible precedent for future privatization efforts. Congress should modernize America’s air traffic control system without enriching unions.
The air traffic control system is unquestionably outdated. The government still uses 1960s technology to track planes in the air. Other countries, such as Canada, have solved this problem by privatizing their air traffic control systems.
These private entities have rapidly switched to more reliable modern technologies that reduce the risk of collision. It is promising that members of Congress have acknowledged the benefits of privatizing air traffic control and have proposed to remove it from federal control, as Canada has.
However, the Aviation Innovation Reform and Reauthorization Act (AIRR) does not address one of the problems impeding reform: the National Association of Air Traffic Controllers, the union representing air-traffic controllers. The union has used its leverage to negotiate gold-plated and diamond-studded compensation packages for its members.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports the median air traffic controller makes $123,000 a year in cash wages. Including noncash benefits brings the average total compensation package to approximately $200,000 a year—vastly more than most private-sector workers in jobs requiring an associate’s degree.
The public pays for these inflated compensation packages through higher taxes on airline passengers. The National Association of Air Traffic Controllers redistributes wealth from taxpayers and the flying public—most of whom make much less than $200,000 a year – to the union’s members.
The “reform” measure does nothing to stop this. Worse, it includes several provisions that strengthen the union’s hand:
Congress could easily fix these problems. Leaving the current dispute reconciliation system in place—instead of shifting to arbitration—would eliminate most of the labor concerns. The rest would be solved by expressly authorizing the new corporation to fire illegally striking workers—as the federal government can do now.
These changes would enable the new agency to keep labor costs in line. But the Aviation Innovation Reform and Reauthorization Act does not take these steps, and instead increases the union’s leverage. Why?
Probably because AIRR supporters want the National Association of Air Traffic Controllers to support the reforms. They appear to have bought this support by offering the union even more power at the quasi-private agency.
Unsurprisingly, the union has endorsed the legislation. But this legislative payoff sets a terrible precedent for future privatization efforts. A non-trivial portion of the financial benefits of privatization come from eliminating the monopoly power of government unions. AIRR  instead strengthens that monopoly power. This would set an expectation that future federal privatization efforts would similarly benefit unions.
Privatizing the air traffic control system is long overdue. But Congress should not strengthen the union’s power over the flying public in the process.

"The new jobs report shows employers cranked up hiring in June, creating 287,000 net new jobs. But the last jobs report, for May, showed the economy slowing to a crawl, with employers adding only 11,000 net new jobs in the month.
What explains these large gyrations? Probably statistical noise.  Americans shouldn’t read too much into May’s discouraging job numbers or June’s hopeful ones.
Both the payroll survey (which estimates job growth) and the household survey (which estimates the unemployment rate) are large-scale surveys. Like any survey, they have a margin of error.
Nine times out of 10, the payroll survey estimate is within plus or minus 115,000 jobs of the actual job growth rate. Similarly, the household survey is within plus or minus 0.2 percentage points of the true unemployment rate 90 percent of the time.
Consequently, statistical noise can cause the household and payroll surveys to fluctuate considerably month to month, even if job growth and unemployment do not change. And 10 percent of the time, the surveys will report estimates outside this confidence interval.
This statistical noise appears to explain the recent whiplash. Job growth plunged in May and rebounded in June. However, the average across both months was plus 149,000 jobs—very close to average job growth in March and April (plus 165,000 jobs).
Many measures of labor market health showed this pattern: dropping in May and rebounding in June.
For example, the labor force participation rate for 25- to 54-year-olds fell 0.2 points in May. It then increased 0.2 points in June. That increase simply returned the participation rate to its April level.
Similarly, the seasonally adjusted number of Americans working part time for economic reasons increased by approximately 500,000 in May and dropped by approximately 600,000 in June.
The unemployment figures also show this pattern. The number of unemployed Americans fell 484,000 in May and the unemployment rate dropped 0.3 percentage points, mostly driven by Americans leaving the job market and no longer looking for work.
Unemployment increased by 347,000 workers in June and the unemployment rate increased 0.2 percentage points, mostly driven by Americans returning to the labor force and looking for work.
Statistical noise almost certainly explains these swings.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ employment reports are surveys. Like all surveys, they have sampling error. Rather than focusing on monthly movements, Americans should look at the long term trend.
These trends show job growth slowed over the past year, but remain far from recessionary levels.
